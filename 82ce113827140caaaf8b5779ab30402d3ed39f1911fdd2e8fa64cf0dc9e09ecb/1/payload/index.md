# About Tantra Labs

The Tantra Labs team is led by CEO, Ped Hasid, information systems specialist, serial entrepreneur, early Bitcoin adopter, and investor in the crypto space. Tantra's Algorithmic trading and platform development is led by CTO, Russell LaCour, data scientist, and full-stack engineer with over 6+ years of experience in Financial Markets. Trading strategies and analysis is led by CIO, Tom Kivisto, a 40+ year veteran in commodities trading who has managed over $3 billion in AUM focusing on the energy sector. Tantra Labs has backing from [Block26](https://block26.com/) and [Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com), both of which have been longtime supporters of Decred. Blockhead Capital recently released its [Decred Investment Thesis](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) which has garnered support from both the Decred and Bitcoin communities.

Tantra Labs has spent the last two and a half years in research and development on automated trading technology. Since deploying the proprietary system eight months ago, our portfolio has outperformed BTC by over 60%. The Tantra Algorithmic Platform is designed to be adaptable for a variety of trading strategies across any market (traditional or crypto), supporting any asset or trading pair, and is poised to support a successful algorithmic market making system.

# Mission

Our sole mission is to provide a valuable service to the Decred community. After countless hours of meetings and discussion we believe we can provide the Decred Community liquidity as a service without charging $40k+ a month (as currently proposed by other service providers). Our proposal to provide liquidity comes with only two costs attached, we propose the community reimburse Tantra Labs for the opportunity cost of unstaking our DCR position for use in market making (or similarly reimburse a lender of DCR who forgoes their staking reward in favor of providing liquidity) and exchange trading fees. For example, if the community requests 2 pairs for 1 year, approx. 10k DCR will be required to provide the liquidity outlined in this proposal, and the community would compensate the estimated staking reward of ~9% or 900 DCR per year. Tantra Labs would cover all other fees and costs (less trading fees) associated with the Market Making.

After the initial roll out, we will open source order book transparency tools via a web interface to provide a strong feedback loop on all market making efforts to the community. Tools are to include historical and real-time data for: Trading Volume across exchanges, Bid/Ask Spread, Bid/Ask Sum, and Combined Order Book. With these tools, more traders and market making entrants can easily deploy strategies to DCR markets. We look forward to getting feedback on future additional transparency tools from the community.

# Why Market Make?

Markets have proven to benefit tremendously from increased liquidity and we aim to bring the same time tested strategies to DCR. These market primitives reduce exposure to price manipulation and allow Decred holders to actively increase or decrease their positions without impacting the price, thus reducing the “illiquidity premium”. By increasing the DCR order book depth, new sophisticated market participants are able to deploy significantly more capital to the global DCR trading volumes, consequently benefiting retail holders and traders by reducing price volatility. As trading volumes increase, DCR will become an available asset to many institutional investors who have strict liquidity requirements in assets held. And ultimately, we believe that increased interest and trading volumes have the potential to lead to a higher DCR valuation.

# Why No Upfront Fee?

Tantra Labs is well capitalized and confident in our systematic approach to market making. It’s also in our best interests, as members of the Decred Community, to provide this service and we do not need to profit at the Community’s expense.  

# How?

To meet the inventory constraints for Market Making, we will use our long-term DCR holdings as well as the holdings from other pre-established relationships who have agreed to lend out the DCR needed to meet the liquidity goals set by the community. Our initial analysis shows we can provide liquidity with 5,000 DCR per pair, for a total of 30,000 DCR. After a period of time, the community can decide whether to provide more or less liquidity — we are open to all avenues and will keep an open line of communication. 

# Initial Liquidity Proposal

In the beginning, we plan to offer 3 BTC / $30,000 of liquidity across all trading pairs in this proposal. As the market matures and the community becomes more comfortable with our Market Making efforts then we will propose to add more liquidity or remove our liquidity as needed.

- We will provide layered quotes (3 BTC / $30k per side within +/-3% of BBO) to provide increased depth and reduce slippage 

- Maintain a tight average market spread: 0.3% for BTC pairs, and .5% for USDT/USD pairs

- 90% uptime assuming no exchange outages/hacks (downtime is discretionary based on periods of high volatility)
