Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? Could you point to any exchange pairs where you are active? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.\n2. I am interested in the \"open source order book transparency\" tools, do you have any examples of these tools in operation which you can point to? It seems like they would present public data from the exchanges. Would you also be willing to provide access to your account activity (through a read only API key, for example, as i2 have offered) so that your market making activity and the associated fees could be verified?\n3. You are offering to perform a similar role to the other market maker proposals, but without the largest cost element (a fee for you to provide this service). This seems too good to be true, and the service you offer must be quite different if it can be provided without charging. Do you aim to make a profit from your market making activities? If so that profit must surely come from other market participants, correct? There must be down sides to the way your offer has been structured, I would like to understand what they are.\n4. You are entering this process much later than the other contenders, which gives you an advantage in that you have already had time to consider the competing offers before submitting your own. Would you care to comment on why your proposal has arrived some weeks later than the others?","signature":"59939eb99e08f36331a984867b5c1f263b7141b6b77bbbde1b8c5af53891b4d78834581a0c1789f68acbc2ea3059e1d44eef607ddf457e111d542d2d2f09b30e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"728d7fc90fbfadde6947efc1786dac28aa18f1bb05b5984c64d38e7f002d792003c4eae1a8dcfed0b154178fe43b17fd1d73596c6cbb48e6e2dead9ac3b7b405","timestamp":1566992992,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
