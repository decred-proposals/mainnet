Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? Could you point to any exchange pairs where you are active? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.\n2. I am interested in the \"open source order book transparency\" tools, do you have any examples of these tools in operation which you can point to? It seems like they would present public data from the exchanges. Would you also be willing to provide access to your account activity (through a read only API key, for example, as i2 have offered) so that your market making activity and the associated fees could be verified?\n3. You are offering to perform a similar role to the other market maker proposals, but without the largest cost element (a fee for you to provide this service). This seems too good to be true, and the service you offer must be quite different if it can be provided without charging. Do you aim to make a profit from your market making activities? If so that profit must surely come from other market participants, correct? There must be down sides to the way your offer has been structured, I would like to understand what they are.\n4. You are entering this process much later than the other contenders, which gives you an advantage in that you have already had time to consider the competing offers before submitting your own. Would you care to comment on why your proposal has arrived some weeks later than the others?","signature":"59939eb99e08f36331a984867b5c1f263b7141b6b77bbbde1b8c5af53891b4d78834581a0c1789f68acbc2ea3059e1d44eef607ddf457e111d542d2d2f09b30e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"728d7fc90fbfadde6947efc1786dac28aa18f1bb05b5984c64d38e7f002d792003c4eae1a8dcfed0b154178fe43b17fd1d73596c6cbb48e6e2dead9ac3b7b405","timestamp":1566992992,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Particularly, I want to understand more about the risks allocation and how the break-even point/profit motive plays out.\n\nIn short, risk carries a cost. I wish to understand how this risk is priced into this model (how is break even achieved and how is the risk taken compensated?)\n\n1. Reviewing your provided slides, you have a reasonably sized team. Can you please clarify if/how MM activities are expected to turn a profit in order to support this team. \n\n2. Am I correct that your operations on exchanges will purely be market making and no actively taken trades will be occurring such that price discovery is organic and driven other market participants only?\n\n3. I understand there is community support in terms of lending DCR liquidity. Recompense for staking rewards is fair. That said, there is clearly risk being taken by these lenders (exchange risk, hack risk, liquidity spikes, loss of funds etc). I am keen for some clarification as to how this risk is priced into the model.\n\n4.

Please find each of the four parts addressed in order below:\n \n1) \nFor the past two years we have been active on BitMEX, and more recently also on Deribit, trading XBTUSD, XBTU19, XBTZ19, BTC-USD, BTC-27SEP19, BTC-27DEC19, all as a liquidity provider. Our algorithms use limit orders only, no taking. Our platform is adaptable to any exchange, any trading pair, whether it be traditional finance or crypto.\n\n\n2 ) \nShortly after going live, we will release a dashboard where the Decred Community can view the historical effect of our market making by viewing the change in Bid/Ask spread overtime, for example. Additionally, we will add the other tools we use internally to backtest and optimize our order book spreads, such as the following: \n- Combined Order Book - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD\n- Bid/Ask Spread - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/spread/7d/USD?c=e\u0026f=m10\u0026st=log\u0026t=l\n- Trading Volume - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e\u0026t=b\n\nWith regards to APIs, we are happy to grant access to a committee of trusted Decred contributors / developers. At this time we do not wish to open up the read-only access to the public to avoid bad actors who may take advantage of our liquidity strategy. \n \n\n3) \nDuring our research, we realized that it is possible to provide this service to the Community without charging a fee. By factoring in our overhead we can set spreads to compensate for our lack of fees. Since the forgone stake rewards and trade fees are being covered by the treasury, that allows us to shift into providing more liquidity and tighter spreads. \n\nWe do not need to charge the Decred Community because our model allows us to fairly provide liquidity to the market. Our goal is not to profit but to break even. Our market making model will be tuned to break even. As believers/holders of DCR we benefit from providing liquidity.\n\n4)\nThe founders of Block26 and Tantra Labs have been involved in Decred since right after the initial Airdrop. They have been accumulating and could not be more bullish on the future of DCR. When we read the other proposals, we were not satisfied with them. We were in fact taken by surprise when they were submitted. There had been no prior public discussion, and the RFP was only put forth after the fact. As community members ourselves, and given our experience with algorithmic trading, we decided that we could make a better offer, one that we ourselves would vote for. As a result, we have spent the last two weeks working tirelessly to research and ready our submission in time to be fairly considered alongside the others.","signature":"649732912f2e7bfd4519ec890c02a93525801e45efda65d6cfd8393c0af37eb3e6b5f563db1e9e32de90415f397ff613b52788a6ea1666f268ed968f724a0208","publickey":"46282ad3959b0f5f492aa782dbac7112b9f48bdb4346e20100224f1a2c478f18","commentid":"5","receipt":"36ceb53ded4208ce79934f625324c66cb523c52290d1515bc89d11a25e545f150d934662d83d3a3dcaa51f5b1a6fd80a11c53413511a9034370f1bcdbc935802","timestamp":1567045642,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

When I requested a look under the hood at their tech I was told, \"sorry that is proprietary.\" Most trading firms looking to raise capital will at the very least provide some detailed data and trading history if not offer to show their system working in a live setting. Now maybe that stance has changed, but that was the nature of our conversations. Secondly, while it's completely possible they weren't aware of the MM RFP, it is odd that once they found out they conveniently submitted their \"own proposal\" on the very day the competing proposals were submitted for voting. Its hard to not to assume that this was all done on purpose.\n\n\u003eUltimately though, we want to support the project and see DCR grow. We are extremely vested in Decred and its community. I say these things not as a knock to our competitor so that we win. I say it as a stakeholder in DCR.\n\n[The claim that the system is \"proprietary\" coupled with what Tantra describes as their experience:](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/82ce113827140caaaf8b5779ab30402d3ed39f1911fdd2e8fa64cf0dc9e09ecb/comments/5)\n\n\u003e1) For the past two years we have been active on BitMEX, and more recently also on Deribit, trading XBTUSD, XBTU19, XBTZ19, BTC-USD, BTC-27SEP19, BTC-27DEC19, all as a liquidity provider. Our algorithms use limit orders only, no taking. Our platform is adaptable to any exchange, any trading pair, whether it be traditional finance or crypto.\n\nFor me, this raises some questions:\n\n* The derivative products described above are some of the most liquid instruments in the space. Trading DCR (one of the most illiquid assets) and making a market will require a very specific model and one that from my own experience and conversations with MMs over the last year has led me to believe it will result in material losses (hence the fees charged by others). How can Tantra project that you will not incur losses?\n\n* In the event Tantra has miscalculated and gets run over quickly in their attempt to be a liquidity provider should you be engaged by the stakeholders, where does that leave us? Will you eat the losses or just abandon the effort and leave Decred back at square one with no MM and a process that has been derailed?","signature":"bd9f81aa73f05856abc838a4e75718609a488b77e002296cb9b15a9f275931239ddb24c3f8b4aac329067ea82dd88786a838341ed8e5dd8251134edfded22c0e","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"7","receipt":"7bc8b9d875aef8024fcffffac111ed0872b2a61394d6808830098b16711806273b3e6493cbfcf73f69fcec633f28249756c4a0aac67bade6c0d67015a3bc8308","timestamp":1567101918,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I am pleased that you would be able to provide transparency on your market making activity to Decred representatives.\n\nCould you clarify the number of pairs that you are proposing to cover please? The table has 7 pairs but elsewhere the proposal says \"we can provide liquidity with 5,000 DCR per pair, for a total of 30,000 DCR\", implying 6 pairs.\n\nDo you have a confirmed lender for the inventory you would need? As I read the proposal, it seems that the source of your inventory would be different to the i2 and Grapefruit proposals. Would you be interested in operating in addition to a primary designated market maker, if one of the other two proposals wins the vote but your proposal also has strong support?\n\nI don't know if that would be desirable, haven't thought it through, but perhaps you could cover some of the exchanges which the designated market maker is not active on.

For example, we could start with y% = 0, to see if compensating for the staking yield would be sufficient.  \n\nPersonally, I believe that offering staking yield forgone should be enough, as earning the yield and maintaining liquidity would be a much better option than needing to have coins locked up to earn the yield. \n\nWe would appoint a designated contractor for, say, [$2000] per month to review data from every MM on its trading operations, perform the spot checks, and ensure the staking yield is being properly paid out.\n\nThoughts?","signature":"a67c99cc9db3041e85aaa5ac9c58e37eda7d0240a3367dc526883e83fcd399e908bb7ab85d29ac3c4d7c8ef70073ecea4f1d51682ad3c31cc3768cc7a1be1704","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"11","receipt":"0a8191f09050d85944eeebf1d21d441298823d8193d245f840ca6c2fc0945101cbdf3b101109a62eaeab42dfec1784977f10b26f9595dcd5868462ed497e1a0b","timestamp":1567105532,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We were in fact taken by surprise when they were submitted. There had been no prior public discussion, and the RFP was only put forth after the fact. As community members ourselves, and given our experience with algorithmic trading, we decided that we could make a better offer, one that we ourselves would vote for. As a result, we have spent the last two weeks working tirelessly to research and ready our submission in time to be fairly considered alongside the others.\n\n\nSo if you knew at a minimum of two weeks ago you were preparing a proposal, why would you wait until after the other proposals had been closed and prepped for voting to submit yours? Why did you not put something in the proposals to at least say, \"hey, we'd like to add our too, its coming?\" I'm no financial guy and i sure as heck have a problem being politically correct, but this smells like bad business practices. It feels like an underhanded move to try to gain an advantage on competitors. It makes me unable to trust your business.","signature":"243db37e153f9e909135371bb340cc570d1b97e44e7d7637171a6e1a1a3ae1261de6e3c949e838d0013578bfc3d1b15d3649fecd45a17b927e6ac30206f92f06","publickey":"0cfb7bc06d5e0a4a64f7213988a9b87428dac462385b5085e6ed49c9b3f116a9","commentid":"13","receipt":"e7e5a160b74bd33e516b36a6af70144d90ee03304344abf44606075265b58dae1da9f812722d55732c6732c63193e6847eb1fc91a93fe2eaa4a6adfd8cbe0500","timestamp":1567183666,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Your price looks low compared to others. Is there a private entity subsidizing part of your expenses? Or are you covering all costs from trading?\n\n2\\. Have you already tried to run your engine on DCR markets or at least run some simuations? If yes, how did it go?\n\n3\\. Do you have any fee discounts on exchanges (e.g. due to existing monthly volume above certain threshold)?\n\n4\\. \"3 BTC / $30k per side within +/-3% of BBO\" and \"Maintain a tight average market spread: 0.3% for BTC pairs, and .5% for USDT/USD pairs\" - so is the spread +/-3% or +/- 0.3%?\n\n5\\. Slippage numbers look odd, it was much better for bigger amounts in the Jul 30 snapshot in the [i2 proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9). Did it get so much worse since then?\n\n6\\. Can you please update the proposal to include the total monthly budget with all things included, your intent to provide read-only API access to select people, and other important details?\n\n7\\. i2 claims you copy-pasted some of their text, can you please comment on that?","signature":"c493b3ed62492773c77035b04911f0629460869810146e77c6da9f0cde4d03aaa868c31421bcf35595bdfc44186540251d6d90a7db7b2995f898ee2b80639d0c","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"21","receipt":"47818dae6448b5767a05c70c144243b5e036bf966eb9ba4998c63c470d9ffe3530b9212f55f5474eff356d1662d088269829ace5b50138132715fcbdd075b007","timestamp":1567204911,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
