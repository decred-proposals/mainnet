Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? Could you point to any exchange pairs where you are active? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.\n2. I am interested in the \"open source order book transparency\" tools, do you have any examples of these tools in operation which you can point to? It seems like they would present public data from the exchanges. Would you also be willing to provide access to your account activity (through a read only API key, for example, as i2 have offered) so that your market making activity and the associated fees could be verified?\n3. You are offering to perform a similar role to the other market maker proposals, but without the largest cost element (a fee for you to provide this service). This seems too good to be true, and the service you offer must be quite different if it can be provided without charging. Do you aim to make a profit from your market making activities? If so that profit must surely come from other market participants, correct? There must be down sides to the way your offer has been structured, I would like to understand what they are.\n4. You are entering this process much later than the other contenders, which gives you an advantage in that you have already had time to consider the competing offers before submitting your own. Would you care to comment on why your proposal has arrived some weeks later than the others?","signature":"59939eb99e08f36331a984867b5c1f263b7141b6b77bbbde1b8c5af53891b4d78834581a0c1789f68acbc2ea3059e1d44eef607ddf457e111d542d2d2f09b30e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"728d7fc90fbfadde6947efc1786dac28aa18f1bb05b5984c64d38e7f002d792003c4eae1a8dcfed0b154178fe43b17fd1d73596c6cbb48e6e2dead9ac3b7b405","timestamp":1566992992,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Particularly, I want to understand more about the risks allocation and how the break-even point/profit motive plays out.\n\nIn short, risk carries a cost. I wish to understand how this risk is priced into this model (how is break even achieved and how is the risk taken compensated?)\n\n1. Reviewing your provided slides, you have a reasonably sized team. Can you please clarify if/how MM activities are expected to turn a profit in order to support this team. \n\n2. Am I correct that your operations on exchanges will purely be market making and no actively taken trades will be occurring such that price discovery is organic and driven other market participants only?\n\n3. I understand there is community support in terms of lending DCR liquidity. Recompense for staking rewards is fair. That said, there is clearly risk being taken by these lenders (exchange risk, hack risk, liquidity spikes, loss of funds etc). I am keen for some clarification as to how this risk is priced into the model.\n\n4. Concur with Reds comment below, that the transparency of operations will be necessary in my mind to provide confidence that activities are appropriate (as with all MM proposals)","signature":"32450e8f483d634e96d16568018920ee7d07b88b615e32b5318385b011aa53d185d575cdad11e6920ef2e33a4f5ddb668db5a1227fa403c8d8068897058ca40b","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"4","receipt":"4db27f1c3642cb0c55ac38254127e1d5aa7ab0d2897174c0007dc21aded4b34b9a94ac775e8e46de349763b8bd9152baacba113c6b4bf46e33cea78eb4cec505","timestamp":1567022107,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Please find each of the four parts addressed in order below:\n \n1) \nFor the past two years we have been active on BitMEX, and more recently also on Deribit, trading XBTUSD, XBTU19, XBTZ19, BTC-USD, BTC-27SEP19, BTC-27DEC19, all as a liquidity provider. Our algorithms use limit orders only, no taking. Our platform is adaptable to any exchange, any trading pair, whether it be traditional finance or crypto.\n\n\n2 ) \nShortly after going live, we will release a dashboard where the Decred Community can view the historical effect of our market making by viewing the change in Bid/Ask spread overtime, for example. Additionally, we will add the other tools we use internally to backtest and optimize our order book spreads, such as the following: \n- Combined Order Book - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/books/USD\n- Bid/Ask Spread - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/spread/7d/USD?c=e\u0026f=m10\u0026st=log\u0026t=l\n- Trading Volume - https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/30d?c=e\u0026t=b\n\nWith regards to APIs, we are happy to grant access to a committee of trusted Decred contributors / developers. At this time we do not wish to open up the read-only access to the public to avoid bad actors who may take advantage of our liquidity strategy. \n \n\n3) \nDuring our research, we realized that it is possible to provide this service to the Community without charging a fee. By factoring in our overhead we can set spreads to compensate for our lack of fees. Since the forgone stake rewards and trade fees are being covered by the treasury, that allows us to shift into providing more liquidity and tighter spreads. \n\nWe do not need to charge the Decred Community because our model allows us to fairly provide liquidity to the market. Our goal is not to profit but to break even. Our market making model will be tuned to break even. As believers/holders of DCR we benefit from providing liquidity.\n\n4)\nThe founders of Block26 and Tantra Labs have been involved in Decred since right after the initial Airdrop. They have been accumulating and could not be more bullish on the future of DCR. When we read the other proposals, we were not satisfied with them. We were in fact taken by surprise when they were submitted. There had been no prior public discussion, and the RFP was only put forth after the fact. As community members ourselves, and given our experience with algorithmic trading, we decided that we could make a better offer, one that we ourselves would vote for. As a result, we have spent the last two weeks working tirelessly to research and ready our submission in time to be fairly considered alongside the others.","signature":"649732912f2e7bfd4519ec890c02a93525801e45efda65d6cfd8393c0af37eb3e6b5f563db1e9e32de90415f397ff613b52788a6ea1666f268ed968f724a0208","publickey":"46282ad3959b0f5f492aa782dbac7112b9f48bdb4346e20100224f1a2c478f18","commentid":"5","receipt":"36ceb53ded4208ce79934f625324c66cb523c52290d1515bc89d11a25e545f150d934662d83d3a3dcaa51f5b1a6fd80a11c53413511a9034370f1bcdbc935802","timestamp":1567045642,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
