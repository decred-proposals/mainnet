As an independent, non-C0, non-RG dev contractor I'm keen on seeing how this one will turn out.\n\nI believe efforts to further decentralize development from the original C0 group are very valid and significant for the ecosystem as a whole (and while I'm not a C0 employee and can't speak for them I also think they themselves are the major proponent of decentralization via e.g. the recent treasury work). \n\nSince this might affect future proposals by myself and other independent devs and groups, I'd like to point out some things that jumped to me while reading this proposal. I'll put my own opinion on these but I'm generally uncertain on most of them so I'm very interested to know the opinion and eventual voting outcome on them.\n\n\u003e Matrix Chat\n\nAs a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc). C0 has a private chat infrastructure for its employees. \n\nIs funding for a generic matrix server something that the treasury should be used for? If I (or a group of BR devs for example) wanted to run our own matrix server, would it be reasonable to ask for the treasury to fund the administrative burden of this? What if it's a bridged discord server?\n\nI'm personally contrary to this in this particular proposal: either the decred community only needs one matrix server (falling under some contractor's responsibility to run) or (my personal preference) it needs _none_ and everyone is free to join from whatever server they want.\n\nI understand that due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to _not_ have an \"official looking\" server (a single URL we can direct incoming people to) and that's why I hedged on the previous paragraph. But in any case, it doesn't feel right to me to have the treasury support more than one server.\n\n\u003e Dcrdata\n\nI'm reasonably ok with this one: since RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable. \n\n\u003e Other Servers\n\nMost of these also seem like something that shouldn't fall on the treasury to fund for the moment. I'd make an exception for the seeders, but see my last point on policy below.\n\n\u003e Code Management\n\nSeems reasonable.\n\n\u003e Website \u0026 Blog\n\nWhy do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it _failing_ to publish relevant material?\n\n\u003e Who\n\nI'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats. I don't really follow dcrdata development that closesly so I may be missing their interactions but I feel I haven't seen any of the listed devs on the open chat channels (but again, this is probably just me not actively looking for them).\n\n\u003e Cost\n\n\u003e Server hosting: $3000\n\u003e Server administration: $6000\n\nI feel these are a bit on the high side (excluding dcrdata) though I'm definitely biased here: I'm only familiar with my own installs which are **tiny** and probably have nowhere near the traffic the planetdecred infra sees or will see. I'd expect more input from other syadmins here.\n\n\u003e Local Events\n\nNo comment since this is way outside my area of influence.\n\n\n## Policy Debate\n\nNow, the real question this proposal brings forward IMO is the policy question on how should Decred's infra, as maintained by the various contractors, be financed by the treasury? \n\nFor example, mainnet seeders: who should be \"allowed\" to run one and who should be \"allowed\" to bill the treasury for the operational overhead of running one? Obviously seeders are a somewhat sensitive asset, so only \"reputable community members\" (in whatever way we'd want to define that) should run seeders that get included in the widely distributed binaries. And given an increase in the size of network I can see how running one might get expensive. Having a uniform policy seems initially the most sensible alternative (e.g. up to X USD/month for anyone running a seeder) though that fails in other directions (someone locating a server on a high cost, highly accessible location vs low cost, high latency location).\n\nWe _can_ always decide to do this in an ad hoc way, so each individual proposal by each individual contractor defines all aspects of the operation but this seems wasteful (and needlessly political) so I'd like to start this debate on whether it is now (or would be in the future) better to define some clear cut policy for such operational costs.\n\n\n","signature":"2ec51f08778e425347ece66f72ef6ba95cc2741b24470cffa785ed20b4b6b0e72ce6e5676ed52c3a4c86cf3d36b31f2957e9c6f97944194159ade7206a31bb08","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"7e11f712b5c7ce4cba96f81d741c63340639ddb2e90355ff0d783bc403b9fe3cb427820447f01163bc461471d58b5bdbab22cb0b48eb918e51cd7f4fc556fc01","timestamp":1591181782,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And while they are the ones who are currently getting this done, its a major problem that so much talent ends up centralized within a single group which has often operated in their own internal fashion. This may not be their fault, but the future of decred depends on the community looking at how we can foster and fund the growth of other groups.\n\n\u003e As a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc).\n\nThe reality of how we operate is that 100% of RG work is currently for the benefit of Decred. We often have incurred many of these costs ourself without seeking treasury funding. These costs were not a terrible burden. Due to the distinction of corporate identities being separate from \"the\" decred organization itself, this is why I have decided that the infrastructure we are building for our operations needs to be under a decred organization that is approved by the stakeholders.\n\n\u003e due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to not have an \"official looking\" server\n\nI will speak to my primary reasoning first. Whenever someone operates a server, they become a point of failure. They become the **trusted party** responsible for server up time, they choose how frequently software updates are deployed and what software packages are used. They are responsible for the data security of the server. In some places admin level permissions are granted for privileged operations. Simply put, its a gatekeeper. I wont create a detailed list of potential situations because there are too many possible cases which could have a definite positive or negative outcome for decred. The infrastructure the community uses is a technology that facilitates how we operate. Having redundancy not just in server instances, but diversity in operational protocol and personnel will make decred stronger.\n\nOn the not so technical side, there is a question of culture. A single server identity does becomes a centralizing force for culture and brand. Now on this point some may argue that we want_ cohesion to keep us together because that makes us stronger, and I would not dismiss that argument off hand. Up till this point I was skeptical that a proposal such a this was needed and that was why I didn't act on it till now. But I do see calls from around that there may be a broader decred community outside of what some people feel is the set Overton window on the primary decred.org chat server. This may be the case now today, or it may be more relevant at some point in the future. I believe in the idea of voice or exit, and want to give alternative view points a place to organize if they need a place to exit to. That to me is true decentralization. The cross-server communication modes that matrix supports strikes the right balance of independence and compatibility to facilitate ongoing dialog which will allow for diversity as well as unity. As one of the longest standing decred community team leaders, and one that is not part of the founding group, I feel it is my responsibility to take this action for the betterment of decred.\n\nNow on the practical, it does open up the question of how much decentralization is needed and what should the treasury fund. Having 1 official server is not decentralized, but having 2 official servers is. An additional benefit is that this would easily silence outside critics who would take a single chat server as a metric to criticize our level of decentralization. For both of my above points on the technical and cultural nature of this decision, I urge the stakeholders to take careful consideration, now and in the future, of the health of our technology operations and our culture, as well as the available funds in the treasury and the cost a proposal will incur. The items I have listed in this proposal were grouped together because they are of a low cost and have high potential value relative to their cost.\n\n\u003e I'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats.\n\nAgreed, and I think the above points on the creation of a new chat server with cross over capability will reduce barriers in connectivity and culture. PD also has plans outside the scope of this proposal to continue taking action into the future to improve dialog.\n\n\u003e RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable.\n\nIt has recently created large improvements in our development-testing-feedback cycles to be able to quickly deploy new features to our own instances to demo to the decred community. It also provides the community more visibility into our work. Upstream dcrdata often has had long development and release cycles that have not coincided with our testing and delivery cycles. We will continue to seek out ways to coordinate with all dcrdata developers, but at this point the cost and benefits do not indicate that we need to create an unnecessary dependency that is easily avoidable. The development of 'multiple style' dcrdata interfaces can create diversity in design that would serve a broader user base who may have different preferences. I've fielded many requests from the community on features they would like to see. When we submit the features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders, if for whatever reason other dcrdata maintainers do not feel like including the changes in the master branch, the PD developers would then have the ability to maintain the changes in our own branch and deploy the features to the community on accessible servers. Likewise, our branch could be merged into upstream after further refinement if consensus is achieved. Our servers will also providce redundancy in the case of server outages, can be used for independent verification of data points being retrieved, and there are also privacy reason why data queries should be distributed. Overall, I am quite happy with the great progress that all dcrdata developers have made together.\n\nsee part two of this post","signature":"a30648ede61b4d6f8c55d94cc70c1418caef439f78817d5457780dddd54c92a5f588e245465969603508f09cbe0c2986318ca2656ec41856a62533792941290d","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"2","receipt":"9c05971e3b9718009453cf214ee8d0805db771916c1fc0ea0e0d26e1b40137bc4f0df5d820b45bcea079297187fd18b7053e3c5bbcefe429a646a239cc311903","timestamp":1591213941,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'd make an exception for the seeders\n\nThe decred testnet faucet has suffered substantial downtime over the last few years. The data to analyze the failure was only available to those with authorization to access it. Admins have frequently been unresponsive. If there were multiple testnet faucets available, developers would have been unblocked from getting the testnet funds they needed to complete their tasks. The cost in productivity has exceeded the cost it would take to deploy an additional one for backup. Several community members have requested a secondary CSPP server. There have been many cases where the CSPP server has gone down and interrupted ticket purchasing for a large number of users of the decred blockchain. When it fails, there is no secondary one for users to point their client to. Developers on my team, who have worked on the CSPP code, are not able to gather any data from the server logs on what caused the server failure. In the future we plan on moving the CSPP code base to a mesh mode which will require multiple servers to operate, and will require more personal to have experience operating instances of the CSPP server in order to test and troubleshoot bugs and new features. Our community vsp / staking system has not been healthy. Too many times a new users has tried to setup Decrediton with a VSP, and has encountered numerous failures. Some users outright give up and walk away from Decred. The failures are sometimes related to conditions that occur in Decrediton, sometimes the vsp, sometimes a combination. Its not a good on-boarding experience to decred staking to go into a large troubleshooting session to try and get a vsp configured. **This is why RG took the initiative in building the code to switch to a non-account based VSP system, to one that uses ticket based authentication instead.** After careful analysis of the issue, we determined there was a fundamental flaw in the original design. It will become a turn key experience for users and in my opinion will solve the biggest issue we have today in on-boarding. PD will monitor the situation and may choose to run a vsp or partner with other vsp operators in order to maintain high quality standards.\n\n\u003eWhy do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it failing to publish relevant material?\n\nThe information published on that blog certainly comes with its own slant, approval process, sometimes with negligent omissions. It provides a lot of great information and I am open to collaborating on posts to it. Its a great example for how PD can better communicate our achievements to a larger audience. This is why we are taking action now. PD community members may choose to come together on our own posts and publish them ourselves. An additional blog comes at low cost, and with the decred consumers frequently desiring more insight into current developments, I expect a secondary blog for the decred community from PD will get a warm welcome from our users.\n\n\u003e\u003eServer hosting: $3000 Server administration: $6000\n\n\u003eI feel these are a bit on the high side\n\nThis breaks down to $500 a month in hosting costs, and $1000 a month in admin work hours. Initial hosting costs may be lower, but I wanted to give us some buffer since this is a 6 month commitment. A majority of sys admin work is often just in setting up and deploying new servers, and several items listed in the proposal would require new setups. Ideally it would just run itself at that point, but regular software updates have to be done to maintain security, and inevitably there are failures that occur which have to be tended to. Sys admins support developers by making configuration updates they need to support new requirements from developers. Currently we have been experiencing increased dcrdata dev server costs due to the high cpu, disk, ram requirements to process large amounts of data. We can quickly get developers unblocked by increasing the resource requirements but at a cost. We can also make software optimizations that can reduce hardware costs, sometimes dramatically, but these software changes also have a cost, take time, and require we have developers to allocate to these tasks. These are a few of the issues that need to be managed on a day to day basis. $1000 a month translates to only several days out of the month for one individual to focus on these tasks. I believe it will be enough for now, but I also see these costs growing in the future. As decred grows, so will our need for increased data security and high availability up-times.\n\n\u003eonly \"reputable community members\" (in whatever way we'd want to define that) should run seeders that get included in the widely distributed binaries\n\nI project that in the future we may need widely distributed binaries to come from different sources. The first step towards this is to make reproducible binaries available from multiple locations.","signature":"fa69b936f25efce84f62447d0b4c6b5023fb486bcaf0fe44f5a985b6f2efd795ddb54f80e0fad6eebd1b803142d5fc64105bf994a08587e362d585368b1be601","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"3","receipt":"a714503e2d2de4a77aa052d47ccb8b7528e7606ca490ca11e422d7b70fc0cdebb120ac673364c8616d2f2df1f6c4b873712bdd515ef5d10d1c4306cd2bf11406","timestamp":1591213968,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
