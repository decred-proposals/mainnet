As an independent, non-C0, non-RG dev contractor I'm keen on seeing how this one will turn out.\n\nI believe efforts to further decentralize development from the original C0 group are very valid and significant for the ecosystem as a whole (and while I'm not a C0 employee and can't speak for them I also think they themselves are the major proponent of decentralization via e.g. the recent treasury work). \n\nSince this might affect future proposals by myself and other independent devs and groups, I'd like to point out some things that jumped to me while reading this proposal. I'll put my own opinion on these but I'm generally uncertain on most of them so I'm very interested to know the opinion and eventual voting outcome on them.\n\n\u003e Matrix Chat\n\nAs a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc). C0 has a private chat infrastructure for its employees. \n\nIs funding for a generic matrix server something that the treasury should be used for? If I (or a group of BR devs for example) wanted to run our own matrix server, would it be reasonable to ask for the treasury to fund the administrative burden of this? What if it's a bridged discord server?\n\nI'm personally contrary to this in this particular proposal: either the decred community only needs one matrix server (falling under some contractor's responsibility to run) or (my personal preference) it needs _none_ and everyone is free to join from whatever server they want.\n\nI understand that due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to _not_ have an \"official looking\" server (a single URL we can direct incoming people to) and that's why I hedged on the previous paragraph. But in any case, it doesn't feel right to me to have the treasury support more than one server.\n\n\u003e Dcrdata\n\nI'm reasonably ok with this one: since RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable. \n\n\u003e Other Servers\n\nMost of these also seem like something that shouldn't fall on the treasury to fund for the moment. I'd make an exception for the seeders, but see my last point on policy below.\n\n\u003e Code Management\n\nSeems reasonable.\n\n\u003e Website \u0026 Blog\n\nWhy do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it _failing_ to publish relevant material?\n\n\u003e Who\n\nI'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats. I don't really follow dcrdata development that closesly so I may be missing their interactions but I feel I haven't seen any of the listed devs on the open chat channels (but again, this is probably just me not actively looking for them).\n\n\u003e Cost\n\n\u003e Server hosting: $3000\n\u003e Server administration: $6000\n\nI feel these are a bit on the high side (excluding dcrdata) though I'm definitely biased here: I'm only familiar with my own installs which are **tiny** and probably have nowhere near the traffic the planetdecred infra sees or will see. I'd expect more input from other syadmins here.\n\n\u003e Local Events\n\nNo comment since this is way outside my area of influence.\n\n\n## Policy Debate\n\nNow, the real question this proposal brings forward IMO is the policy question on how should Decred's infra, as maintained by the various contractors, be financed by the treasury? \n\nFor example, mainnet seeders: who should be \"allowed\" to run one and who should be \"allowed\" to bill the treasury for the operational overhead of running one? Obviously seeders are a somewhat sensitive asset, so only \"reputable community members\" (in whatever way we'd want to define that) should run seeders that get included in the widely distributed binaries. And given an increase in the size of network I can see how running one might get expensive. Having a uniform policy seems initially the most sensible alternative (e.g. up to X USD/month for anyone running a seeder) though that fails in other directions (someone locating a server on a high cost, highly accessible location vs low cost, high latency location).\n\nWe _can_ always decide to do this in an ad hoc way, so each individual proposal by each individual contractor defines all aspects of the operation but this seems wasteful (and needlessly political) so I'd like to start this debate on whether it is now (or would be in the future) better to define some clear cut policy for such operational costs.\n\n\n","signature":"2ec51f08778e425347ece66f72ef6ba95cc2741b24470cffa785ed20b4b6b0e72ce6e5676ed52c3a4c86cf3d36b31f2957e9c6f97944194159ade7206a31bb08","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"7e11f712b5c7ce4cba96f81d741c63340639ddb2e90355ff0d783bc403b9fe3cb427820447f01163bc461471d58b5bdbab22cb0b48eb918e51cd7f4fc556fc01","timestamp":1591181782,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And while they are the ones who are currently getting this done, its a major problem that so much talent ends up centralized within a single group which has often operated in their own internal fashion. This may not be their fault, but the future of decred depends on the community looking at how we can foster and fund the growth of other groups.\n\n\u003e As a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc).\n\nThe reality of how we operate is that 100% of RG work is currently for the benefit of Decred. We often have incurred many of these costs ourself without seeking treasury funding. These costs were not a terrible burden. Due to the distinction of corporate identities being separate from \"the\" decred organization itself, this is why I have decided that the infrastructure we are building for our operations needs to be under a decred organization that is approved by the stakeholders.\n\n\u003e due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to not have an \"official looking\" server\n\nI will speak to my primary reasoning first. Whenever someone operates a server, they become a point of failure. They become the **trusted party** responsible for server up time, they choose how frequently software updates are deployed and what software packages are used. They are responsible for the data security of the server. In some places admin level permissions are granted for privileged operations. Simply put, its a gatekeeper. I wont create a detailed list of potential situations because there are too many possible cases which could have a definite positive or negative outcome for decred. The infrastructure the community uses is a technology that facilitates how we operate. Having redundancy not just in server instances, but diversity in operational protocol and personnel will make decred stronger.\n\nOn the not so technical side, there is a question of culture. A single server identity does becomes a centralizing force for culture and brand. Now on this point some may argue that we want_ cohesion to keep us together because that makes us stronger, and I would not dismiss that argument off hand. Up till this point I was skeptical that a proposal such a this was needed and that was why I didn't act on it till now. But I do see calls from around that there may be a broader decred community outside of what some people feel is the set Overton window on the primary decred.org chat server. This may be the case now today, or it may be more relevant at some point in the future. I believe in the idea of voice or exit, and want to give alternative view points a place to organize if they need a place to exit to. That to me is true decentralization. The cross-server communication modes that matrix supports strikes the right balance of independence and compatibility to facilitate ongoing dialog which will allow for diversity as well as unity. As one of the longest standing decred community team leaders, and one that is not part of the founding group, I feel it is my responsibility to take this action for the betterment of decred.\n\nNow on the practical, it does open up the question of how much decentralization is needed and what should the treasury fund. Having 1 official server is not decentralized, but having 2 official servers is. An additional benefit is that this would easily silence outside critics who would take a single chat server as a metric to criticize our level of decentralization. For both of my above points on the technical and cultural nature of this decision, I urge the stakeholders to take careful consideration, now and in the future, of the health of our technology operations and our culture, as well as the available funds in the treasury and the cost a proposal will incur. The items I have listed in this proposal were grouped together because they are of a low cost and have high potential value relative to their cost.\n\n\u003e I'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats.\n\nAgreed, and I think the above points on the creation of a new chat server with cross over capability will reduce barriers in connectivity and culture. PD also has plans outside the scope of this proposal to continue taking action into the future to improve dialog.\n\n\u003e RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable.\n\nIt has recently created large improvements in our development-testing-feedback cycles to be able to quickly deploy new features to our own instances to demo to the decred community. It also provides the community more visibility into our work. Upstream dcrdata often has had long development and release cycles that have not coincided with our testing and delivery cycles. We will continue to seek out ways to coordinate with all dcrdata developers, but at this point the cost and benefits do not indicate that we need to create an unnecessary dependency that is easily avoidable. The development of 'multiple style' dcrdata interfaces can create diversity in design that would serve a broader user base who may have different preferences. I've fielded many requests from the community on features they would like to see. When we submit the features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders, if for whatever reason other dcrdata maintainers do not feel like including the changes in the master branch, the PD developers would then have the ability to maintain the changes in our own branch and deploy the features to the community on accessible servers. Likewise, our branch could be merged into upstream after further refinement if consensus is achieved. Our servers will also providce redundancy in the case of server outages, can be used for independent verification of data points being retrieved, and there are also privacy reason why data queries should be distributed. Overall, I am quite happy with the great progress that all dcrdata developers have made together.\n\nsee part two of this post","signature":"a30648ede61b4d6f8c55d94cc70c1418caef439f78817d5457780dddd54c92a5f588e245465969603508f09cbe0c2986318ca2656ec41856a62533792941290d","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"2","receipt":"9c05971e3b9718009453cf214ee8d0805db771916c1fc0ea0e0d26e1b40137bc4f0df5d820b45bcea079297187fd18b7053e3c5bbcefe429a646a239cc311903","timestamp":1591213941,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'd make an exception for the seeders\n\nThe decred testnet faucet has suffered substantial downtime over the last few years. The data to analyze the failure was only available to those with authorization to access it. Admins have frequently been unresponsive. If there were multiple testnet faucets available, developers would have been unblocked from getting the testnet funds they needed to complete their tasks. The cost in productivity has exceeded the cost it would take to deploy an additional one for backup. Several community members have requested a secondary CSPP server. There have been many cases where the CSPP server has gone down and interrupted ticket purchasing for a large number of users of the decred blockchain. When it fails, there is no secondary one for users to point their client to. Developers on my team, who have worked on the CSPP code, are not able to gather any data from the server logs on what caused the server failure. In the future we plan on moving the CSPP code base to a mesh mode which will require multiple servers to operate, and will require more personal to have experience operating instances of the CSPP server in order to test and troubleshoot bugs and new features. Our community vsp / staking system has not been healthy. Too many times a new users has tried to setup Decrediton with a VSP, and has encountered numerous failures. Some users outright give up and walk away from Decred. The failures are sometimes related to conditions that occur in Decrediton, sometimes the vsp, sometimes a combination. Its not a good on-boarding experience to decred staking to go into a large troubleshooting session to try and get a vsp configured. **This is why RG took the initiative in building the code to switch to a non-account based VSP system, to one that uses ticket based authentication instead.** After careful analysis of the issue, we determined there was a fundamental flaw in the original design. It will become a turn key experience for users and in my opinion will solve the biggest issue we have today in on-boarding. PD will monitor the situation and may choose to run a vsp or partner with other vsp operators in order to maintain high quality standards.\n\n\u003eWhy do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it failing to publish relevant material?\n\nThe information published on that blog certainly comes with its own slant, approval process, sometimes with negligent omissions. It provides a lot of great information and I am open to collaborating on posts to it. Its a great example for how PD can better communicate our achievements to a larger audience. This is why we are taking action now. PD community members may choose to come together on our own posts and publish them ourselves. An additional blog comes at low cost, and with the decred consumers frequently desiring more insight into current developments, I expect a secondary blog for the decred community from PD will get a warm welcome from our users.\n\n\u003e\u003eServer hosting: $3000 Server administration: $6000\n\n\u003eI feel these are a bit on the high side\n\nThis breaks down to $500 a month in hosting costs, and $1000 a month in admin work hours. Initial hosting costs may be lower, but I wanted to give us some buffer since this is a 6 month commitment. A majority of sys admin work is often just in setting up and deploying new servers, and several items listed in the proposal would require new setups. Ideally it would just run itself at that point, but regular software updates have to be done to maintain security, and inevitably there are failures that occur which have to be tended to. Sys admins support developers by making configuration updates they need to support new requirements from developers. Currently we have been experiencing increased dcrdata dev server costs due to the high cpu, disk, ram requirements to process large amounts of data. We can quickly get developers unblocked by increasing the resource requirements but at a cost. We can also make software optimizations that can reduce hardware costs, sometimes dramatically, but these software changes also have a cost, take time, and require we have developers to allocate to these tasks. These are a few of the issues that need to be managed on a day to day basis. $1000 a month translates to only several days out of the month for one individual to focus on these tasks. I believe it will be enough for now, but I also see these costs growing in the future. As decred grows, so will our need for increased data security and high availability up-times.\n\n\u003eonly \"reputable community members\" (in whatever way we'd want to define that) should run seeders that get included in the widely distributed binaries\n\nI project that in the future we may need widely distributed binaries to come from different sources. The first step towards this is to make reproducible binaries available from multiple locations.","signature":"fa69b936f25efce84f62447d0b4c6b5023fb486bcaf0fe44f5a985b6f2efd795ddb54f80e0fad6eebd1b803142d5fc64105bf994a08587e362d585368b1be601","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"3","receipt":"a714503e2d2de4a77aa052d47ccb8b7528e7606ca490ca11e422d7b70fc0cdebb120ac673364c8616d2f2df1f6c4b873712bdd515ef5d10d1c4306cd2bf11406","timestamp":1591213968,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I do have a few questions though, maybe you can clarify a few things for me.\n\nI see no mention and/or funds requested for dcrandroid or dcrios, so after this proposal would your team and most other devs under this new banner continue to bill toward dev proposals put up by C0 or are new proposals expected to come later from RG for this work? When I saw this proposal go up, my first thought was that it would encompass all dev work from RG (or planet decred) so that we have 2 major contractors groups approved directly by stakeholders, which would be fitting for the decentralized treasury changes coming up.\n\nRegarding Planet Decred, I think it's a great initiative, and if some devs want to group under this banner why not! I expect and hope we'll have many organizations of all kinds contributing over time (individuals, corporate, community based, maybe even sub DAOs).  However I find myself hesitant for the treasury to pay for server and web maintenance for any such organization front page. If feels pretty much the same as if C0 was billing the treasury for https://www.companyzero.com/ server and maintenance.  (and they aren't billing for this as far as I know ?)\n\nFinally regarding decredpower,  it's a cute page and original idea. However I fail to see how it's worth 3000$ over a six month period (considering prior work is not requested). For example the last modification date as of the writing of this comment is \"2020-04-14\", which was almost 2 months ago.

And one server per user would be maximally decentralized. The entire point of matrix is that any individual homeserver matter _very little_ and in fact, just two days ago they announced a p2p matrix PoC that allows one to run a personal homeserver in the browser (https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix/).\n\nAs I wrote in the original, I'm personally, \"philosophically\" in favor of the treasury funding _no_ home servers.

If this is meant to _split_ the decred community chat rooms due to differing moderation style desired then I'm even _more_ against it: we're small enough as it is.

What _should_ be the (dare I say) \"editorial line\" of blog.decred.org?\n\nI publish (and will continue to publish) my writings on my own page. I'm happy to write simplified stuff to syndicate on blog.decred.org if prompted. But if funding from the treasury is available for existing contractors for decred-related **blogs** then I could do the same thing. Is this a policy we wanna encourage? This is a rhetorical question of course: ultimately stakeholders will decide and this can be decided on a case-by-case basis, but I personally disagree that funding should be provided for (any) contractor-specific hosting.\n\nControl of stuff under the decred.org domain _is_ an issue.

Again, this is only \"a feel\" so I'm inclined to accept these amounts at face value unless other people with greater sysadmin experience to also comment on this. Would also be helpful to know the costs of the existing (decred.org) testnet/mainnet dcrdata instances for comparison.\n\n\u003e The first step towards this is to make reproducible binaries available from multiple locations\n\nThe point of reproducible binaries is to _not need multiple locations_. As long as multiple sources attest to correctness of the generated binaries (i.e. attest that the hash of a locally generated copy and the hosted binaries match), you can grab them from anywhere (even a virus-laden pirate site - but don't do this). We did this informally for 1.5.0 in the chat (devs posting the generated binaries matched among themselves) but would probably be useful (and even an interesting marketing  op) to do this _publicly_ for 1.6.0 (for example: get multiple people to record their screen building and verifying the binaries match then post on twitter/wherever under a common hashtag). It would also be useful if people other than C0 _signed_ the released binaries and posted their signatures somewhere.","signature":"53e7d3ba7b4737fd120131c33737ae78f46f3c02f5635f429e03de04635851f1cc7df7c9f7b2b04f16f15271e476aa85767a2efa59a2e881003656e0e971a00b","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"6","receipt":"22ebe1a5f76c7bac50df4419cc4db4d234e3d2f67a4657206ccf54056ae77b07448a534b86c6784e643485a6f0bbdbc38caff011ebde5512983f22e0fa0a290d","timestamp":1591276758,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You say you are in favor of core infrastructure alternatives, but then you say you are not in favor of services related to planetdecred.org . Do you mean you want the alternatives to run on hostnames that are pointed to decred.org ? This seems to be an unnecessary centralization to me if we are referring the the domain name specifically. I would like to silence the critics who say, \"so if decred is actually decentralized, then who runs the website?\".  How much does the official decred.org website cost? Could it be done better? How do we get there if we do not support competition? Related... \"I really don't even like the idea of having 'official' things in general. The problem of oracles, who gets to decide what is appropriate and what isn't. The same old appeal to authority nonsense.\" -davecgh\n\nI think your suggestion on getting more clarity on infrastructure costs is wise. That is also why I have included many items on this proposal, grouped together that are low cost. I believe it is important that all costs are approved by stakeholders via proposals. \n\nFor local events, the reason it was included on this proposal was because it is a small cost item, which many of the items on this proposal are. I didn't want to burden stakeholders with lots of proposals for every little thing. The goal is to get all expenses covered by proposals.

It is exactly the same as company 0, even if there is possible variations in the model of these organizations (community / corporate etc..).  If the treasury were to allocate funds to  planetdecred.org it would create an unfair playing field for when Planet Decred bids for new proposals and compete with other contractor entities who didn't receive funds to build an internet presence.  It is exactly the same thing as if an individual dev, was requesting funding to perfect it's personal web page and portfolio instead of requesting payment for actual work on the project.\n\nUnless there's an issue I'm unaware of,  https://decred.org/contributors/#development  is pretty neutral and gives the exact same visibility to all devs and contrator groups. There is no reason to fund an alternate public facing page only for a subset of them.  Plus decred.org is not a contractor group and has almost no mention of Company 0 except in the history section and in the contributors page previously linked. Planet Decred however is a contractor group that will be billing the treasury and potentially competing with other groups for funding.\n\n","signature":"dc8bdffce0508fbdfd9d3677e7e697f4c565e3eee9966789b75e63046299f351c6e5dd34e494f683857b56e47c8bcd81fdbc404ddd5f71fcb01f01df629de102","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"12","receipt":"09a067668a4518df4ffaa7918a72af1ea1aee8a058a3f035f0333ae4f737b7da8527197e7a4ad9765bf3124d0ea7fcdd1e23de3132de741697852e81aaea6405","timestamp":1591296235,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

What should be covered out of pocket and what should be funded by the treasury. I find it hard to believe that the same services I am describing and proposing to run, transparently in a proposal, have not been incurring any cost on the treasury from decred.org.\n\nI also find the matrix p2p work and removing home servers all together to be very interesting, but it doesnt seem like thats where we are today. Its still in development.\n\n\u003e I'm personally, \"philosophically\" in favor of the treasury funding no home servers. \n\nThis would be a consistent view. If the community was to agree on this, I would find that quite acceptable and unbiased. \n\n\u003e Presumably you'll still be using the rooms initially hosted in the decred.org homeserver\n\nThat is not my intention. Rooms that are primarily composed of activity from planetdecred developers would be in a room that is homed on planetdecred.org. The domain is a specific centralized component we are providing a solution for.\n\n\u003e If this is meant to split the decred community chat rooms due to differing moderation style desired then I'm even more against it\n\nThe intention is not to split anyone. It is to recognize collaboration, independence, and inter-dependence. Previously our work had grown out of chat rooms that were not matrix based. This sometimes made communication cumbersome. Matrix was specifically chosen because of the federated mode compatibility with the existing decred.org server.  Since the planetdecred.org team has setup our own server, we've already made enhancements such as optimizing the way our github notification bot works which has provided a noticeable boost in productivity. We are looking at several matrix server features we can utilize in the future to improve our operations. We didn't have to rely on anyone else to get this done. Requiring the use of decred.org for our services creates all kinds of authorization bottlenecks that centralize the process.","signature":"a5a4a5f552a39f567211d22a87c56fb7c4a0c929736f1a7c17293fd40cdf474d7970ae8b4cc7da72d56c0dadbfb810577659a225f45463ff719f18d89b4b5600","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"13","receipt":"12efaea9b5f0932227f422e1dbf950fcab21194923c96626d25d71c86088a6c38d36cdf1b109c33b8ab224005a7425aadca05d733e583b83ab842cf0bd93cf0c","timestamp":1591296717,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It also provides the community more visibility into our work.  Upstream dcrdata often has had long development and release cycles that have not coincided with our testing and delivery cycles. We will continue to seek out ways to coordinate with all dcrdata developers, but at this point the cost and benefits do not indicate that we need to create an unnecessary dependency that is easily avoidable. The development of 'multiple style' dcrdata interfaces can create diversity in design that would serve a broader user base who may have different preferences. I've fielded many requests from the community on features they would like to see. When we **submit the features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders, if for whatever reason other dcrdata maintainers do not feel like including the changes in the master branch, the PD developers would then have the ability to maintain the changes in our own branch and deploy the features to the community on accessible servers**. Likewise, our branch could be merged into upstream after further refinement if consensus is achieved.\n\nFor the last ~1yr dcrdata has had long review cycles and slower development in general as a direct consequence of @buck54321 and myself dedicating a large portion of our time to dcrdex.  I hope to direct a larger portion of my time to dcrdata in the future, but I acknowledge this slow down.\n\nI understand the value in hosting your own feature branches to showcase your work that is either not yet deployed on the main dcrdata site or was not merged.  You seem to have done this with the attack cost calculator and some mixing charts that both took time to merge, and **I suspect the community benefited from those previews**.  Although I will say there were *very* good reasons for the charts PRs delays that I'd prefer not to get into but heavy resource usage was a main reason -- to your point about optimization reducing resource costs -- and that had to be addressed before we could even think about putting it on the main dcrdata site that needs to handle heavy traffic and cannot block for minutes while regenerating charts data.  This was evident on dev machines, and became very clear when deploying these PRs to alpha.dcrdata.org, which was quite crippled as a result.  An early version of the mix charts was based on rough estimates while the necessary DB work was done, and I'm glad we ended up with charts that reflect the on chain data with absolute fidelity rather than estimates.  But again, I totally appreciate that it was valuable to show those estimates on your pages ahead of the final implementation.\n\nBut as far as not including the changes in the master branch, I need to say that does not happen very often.  When that does happen it is usually because there was insufficient communication of either the vision for that thing or even the intent to develop it, or it simply doesn't work out the way we wanted.  The \"visual blocks\" page is one such case I will acknowledge as being still not ready for prime time despite ample discussion of the concept prior to starting it, and **I do not think this was any fault of the RG devs**.  **I have closed more than one of my own PRs after it did not pan out**, so this is not favouritism or self dealing.  That said, I'd like if you could clarify the language of \"features we develop that are approved by the stakeholders\" because as far as I know there haven't been any specific dcrdata features given stakeholder approval to develop.  I inquire about this because the implication is we are rejecting stakeholder approved work out of hand, and I've not heard this even suggested prior to this statement.\n\n\u003e Our servers will also providce redundancy in the case of server outages, can be used for independent verification of data points being retrieved, and there are also privacy reason why data queries should be distributed.\n\nMultiple sources for independent verification and privacy is important.  I always encourage people with these concerns to consider running their own dcrdata instances.  I think redundancy in case of outages is a very minor concern though.  I'm pretty proud of our globally load balanced deployment that has seen essentially no down time while maintaining extremely low latencies in most regions of the world... maybe one incident with a TLS certificate in years.\n\n\u003e Overall, I am quite happy with the great progress that all dcrdata developers have made together.\n\nWe appreciate that.  Likewise, I have always appreciated the continual efforts from RG to drive dcrdata forward.  I can say honestly that dcrdata would have taken much much longer to evolve from an ugly but dynamic information page to a full fledged block explorer without RG devs including RogueElement, papacarp, and dmigwi.","signature":"d6d802e20cd8c0284874b210cba32359d656bc27a43a0f69d4f43ddb344310ba4b1a183dc6fd4bfdd855fcb76ad39d1cf89f2bc4fcd5f019edc281615fefc406","publickey":"22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","commentid":"14","receipt":"f49831f76bf8c9f8b1bd80926f2de78589f6bf6e3fc7e408bc1216cdb4a7096543d7af0b34ae21235463f12dda033c5950c02dc59bdbfae32067423ac8441e07","timestamp":1591297061,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Having this dev server was necessary due to regional bandwidth limitations and hardware costs that were not possible for several devs in other parts of the world.

I think its needed. You have demonstrated that its not terribly difficult to do. This was not something that was being debated though. The question remains open on what people should fund out of their own pockets, and who is able to bill the treasury with costs associated with maintaining infrastructure that is used by the community. If there is any infrastructure that is currently funded by the treasury that is handled by contractors I would expect it to be an open bidding process. If infrastructure is not funded by the treasury, then there would be no bias. If there is no competition, does the treasury just have to foot a bill of .. ?  There are just too many unknown. That is why I have brought this proposal to the community and offered to provide these services at a low cost. If others want to put services up for free, thats fine, but what are the costs which the treasury is already paying for decred.org ?\n\n\u003e disagree that experience in operating a centralized CSPP server instance will be relevant\n\nHaving access to server logs is quite necessary for debugged, contributing, and accelerates domain knowledge in the area being worked on.\n\n\u003e running a second server also splits the anonymity set.\n\nThis is specifically why I labeled it a fallback server, so as to not split the anonymity set. Code improvements can also be made to the clients so that if a primary server is not available, a secondary server would be tried. This would prevent the condition of server connection failure where the client stops the purchasing of tickets all together. Currently its a bottleneck that could have direct effects on the health of the network. \n\n\u003e This is a serious issue: are the blog operators failing to publish relevant material that you've submitted about Decred?\n\nThe process of creating this content has been managed behind closed doors. Perhaps not in all cases, but in a great many.\n\n\u003e I publish (and will continue to publish) my writings on my own page.\n\nYes, and this is exactly why the PD community decided to just go and put up our own blog. Same principle. Should it be funded and sanctioned by the stakeholder? Is the decred.org blog funded and sanctioned by the stakeholders? Same principle.\n\n\u003e The point of reproducible binaries is to not need multiple locations.\n\nMy point is that if you have reproducible binaries, you can_ have downloads available from multiple locations and verify that they are the same. Having only a single website that users go to fetch binaries is not necessary, creates no advantages for the end user. I am proposing we move away from having a single website that is the official website for downloads. Anyone can build these and post them on their website themselves. So the primary question this discussion seems to be circulating around is should the stakeholders designate a single party to do this, or multiple parties? Who should the treasury fund and who should they not? Presumably, decred.org bills the treasury for this work. I haven't seen any analysis on the costs of this, but my aim is to get this work covered by a proposal. I am not asking someone else to do it because I know that is bad form. I am saying that we are willing to do it. \n","signature":"cb65bc1032fbc77f5f9016a4e406f2daf324bba65c966cdbb48173c4f47d191d9fb772f4fdffc34c6f791d8a7626b1815a497da52c54b0b6885ef54fd716d101","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"16","receipt":"3f3b039cbff3197ed15551639540a5a940dbda069adee18488f0d0668d7cb3f2906317a3e645d173b25ff79165de6a73ce897b34665df0b20506bb772b8b830d","timestamp":1591300113,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
