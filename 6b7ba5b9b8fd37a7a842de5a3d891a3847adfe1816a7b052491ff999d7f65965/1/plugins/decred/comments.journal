As an independent, non-C0, non-RG dev contractor I'm keen on seeing how this one will turn out.\n\nI believe efforts to further decentralize development from the original C0 group are very valid and significant for the ecosystem as a whole (and while I'm not a C0 employee and can't speak for them I also think they themselves are the major proponent of decentralization via e.g. the recent treasury work). \n\nSince this might affect future proposals by myself and other independent devs and groups, I'd like to point out some things that jumped to me while reading this proposal. I'll put my own opinion on these but I'm generally uncertain on most of them so I'm very interested to know the opinion and eventual voting outcome on them.\n\n\u003e Matrix Chat\n\nAs a corporate entity, it's reasonable (and expected) that you'll run your own operational infrastructure (emails, chat, office software, accounting packages, etc). C0 has a private chat infrastructure for its employees. \n\nIs funding for a generic matrix server something that the treasury should be used for? If I (or a group of BR devs for example) wanted to run our own matrix server, would it be reasonable to ask for the treasury to fund the administrative burden of this? What if it's a bridged discord server?\n\nI'm personally contrary to this in this particular proposal: either the decred community only needs one matrix server (falling under some contractor's responsibility to run) or (my personal preference) it needs _none_ and everyone is free to join from whatever server they want.\n\nI understand that due to operational reasons, it's not entirely efficient to _not_ have an \"official looking\" server (a single URL we can direct incoming people to) and that's why I hedged on the previous paragraph. But in any case, it doesn't feel right to me to have the treasury support more than one server.\n\n\u003e Dcrdata\n\nI'm reasonably ok with this one: since RG seems to be the primary contractor developing dcrdata, running a testnet instance seems reasonable. \n\n\u003e Other Servers\n\nMost of these also seem like something that shouldn't fall on the treasury to fund for the moment. I'd make an exception for the seeders, but see my last point on policy below.\n\n\u003e Code Management\n\nSeems reasonable.\n\n\u003e Website \u0026 Blog\n\nWhy do we need anything other than the existing blog.decred.org for a blog? Is it _failing_ to publish relevant material?\n\n\u003e Who\n\nI'd really love if the listed devs would participate more in the existing chats. I don't really follow dcrdata development that closesly so I may be missing their interactions but I feel I haven't seen any of the listed devs on the open chat channels (but again, this is probably just me not actively looking for them).\n\n\u003e Cost\n\n\u003e Server hosting: $3000\n\u003e Server administration: $6000\n\nI feel these are a bit on the high side (excluding dcrdata) though I'm definitely biased here: I'm only familiar with my own installs which are **tiny** and probably have nowhere near the traffic the planetdecred infra sees or will see. I'd expect more input from other syadmins here.\n\n\u003e Local Events\n\nNo comment since this is way outside my area of influence.\n\n\n## Policy Debate\n\nNow, the real question this proposal brings forward IMO is the policy question on how should Decred's infra, as maintained by the various contractors, be financed by the treasury? \n\nFor example, mainnet seeders: who should be \"allowed\" to run one and who should be \"allowed\" to bill the treasury for the operational overhead of running one? Obviously seeders are a somewhat sensitive asset, so only \"reputable community members\" (in whatever way we'd want to define that) should run seeders that get included in the widely distributed binaries. And given an increase in the size of network I can see how running one might get expensive. Having a uniform policy seems initially the most sensible alternative (e.g. up to X USD/month for anyone running a seeder) though that fails in other directions (someone locating a server on a high cost, highly accessible location vs low cost, high latency location).\n\nWe _can_ always decide to do this in an ad hoc way, so each individual proposal by each individual contractor defines all aspects of the operation but this seems wasteful (and needlessly political) so I'd like to start this debate on whether it is now (or would be in the future) better to define some clear cut policy for such operational costs.\n\n\n","signature":"2ec51f08778e425347ece66f72ef6ba95cc2741b24470cffa785ed20b4b6b0e72ce6e5676ed52c3a4c86cf3d36b31f2957e9c6f97944194159ade7206a31bb08","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"7e11f712b5c7ce4cba96f81d741c63340639ddb2e90355ff0d783bc403b9fe3cb427820447f01163bc461471d58b5bdbab22cb0b48eb918e51cd7f4fc556fc01","timestamp":1591181782,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
