Planet Decred launch proposal

**Thank you for the valuable discussion generated below. It has been determined that items from this proposal should either be broken out into other proposals, or do not require a proposal. Therefor, this likely does not need to go to vote.**

**Planet Decred (PD)** is an initiative from **Raedah Group (RG)** to create broader access to the open source projects we are building for decred, while further decentralizing the development infrastructure for decred.
The primary mission of PD is to actively work towards realizing the decentralized promise of decred.

**Motivation**

As RG development has expanded for decred over the years, and the decred developer community has grown as a whole, it has become clear we need to improve our structure to be able to scale the work we are doing. When the team was small we were able to communicate via ad hoc methods. We have outgrown those tools. Many times we have had new developers who want to work across several decred projects, or existing developers who are already working on other decred projects, who want to contribute to the projects that RG is the primary maintainer of. We have done what was necessary to be operating as an open source project, but the repositories have remained listed under raedahgroup. Decred needs to have a decentralized development infrastructure. This will create resiliency in the servers that are required for development teams to operate. Our aim is to do this in a way that maintains compatibility with existing decred infrastructure.

**Matrix Chat** - We have setup a planetdecred.org matrix chat server, and all developers from RG have moved project discussion to it. This allows us to utilize matrix's decentralized federated mode to facilitate communication between multiple teams, such as with the decred.org matrix server. We also already have a bot setup that is sending github notifications to our rooms. Instructions for connecting with us are listed on [planetdecred.org/chat](https://planetdecred.org/chat) . Decred community members already on matrix can join #planetdecred:planetdecred.org on matrix to join PD discussion. 

**Actions**

**Code Management** - RG has been the maintainer of the mobile applications and associated repositories. RG will transfer the repositories we maintain (dcrandroid, dcrios, dcrlibwallet) to the project account 'planetdecred' on github. All other future work related to PD and that becomes funded by the decred treasury will also reside at this location. Github is being used so that we maintain crossover compatibility with the existing 'decred' project account on github. We would consider other options besides github in the future as needed.

Notes: 
- Dcrdata and events related information were removed to be put under distinct proposals.
- Remaining low cost items were removed. No costs remain.
