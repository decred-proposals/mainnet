Planet Decred launch proposal

**Planet Decred (PD)** is an initiative from **Raedah Group (RG)** to create broader access to the open source projects we are building for decred, while further decentralizing the development infrastructure for decred.
The primary mission of PD is to actively work towards realizing the decentralized promise of decred.

**Motivation**

As RG development has expanded for decred over the years, and the decred developer community has grown as a whole, it has become clear we need to improve our structure to be able to scale the work we are doing. When the team was small we were able to communicate via ad hoc methods. We have outgrown those tools. Many times we have had new developers who want to work across several decred projects, or existing developers who are already working on other decred projects, who want to contribute to the projects that RG is the primary maintainer of. We have done what was necessary to be operating as an open source project, but the repositories have remained listed under raedahgroup. Decred needs to have a decentralized development infrastructure. This will create resiliency in the servers that are required for development teams to operate. Our aim is to do this in a way that maintains compatibility with existing decred infrastructure.

**Actions**

**Matrix Chat** - We have already setup a planetdecred.org matrix chat server, and all developers from RG have moved project discussion to it. This allows us to utilize matrix's decentralized federated mode to facilitate communication between multiple teams, such as with the decred.org matrix server. We also already have a bot setup that is sending github notifications to our rooms. Instructions for connecting with us are listed on [planetdecred.org/chat](https://planetdecred.org/chat) . Decred community members already on matrix can join #planetdecred:planetdecred.org on matrix to join PD discussion. ~50 hours of work was put in to creating and administering this so far.

**Dcrdata** - RG is a co-founder and a major contributor of code and features for dcrdata. For PD, we have already setup and will continue to operate additional dcrdata servers for mainnet https://explorer.planetdecred.org/ and testnet https://testnet.planetdecred.org/ . We also run a dcrdata dev server for our team members to quickly get access to a dcrdata development environment with the needed historic data and disk space. The new PD dcrdata servers had ~25 hours of labor put into setting them up.

**Code Management** - RG has been the maintainer of the mobile applications and associated repositories. With the approval of this proposal, RG will transfer the repositories we maintain (dcrandroid, dcrios, dcrlibwallet) to the project account 'planetdecred' on github. All other future work related to PD and that becomes funded by the decred treasury will also reside at this location. Github is being used so that we maintain crossover compatibility with the existing 'decred' project account on github. We would consider other options besides github in the future as needed.

**Website & Blog** - We have setup and will continue to maintain a website at [planetdecred.org](https://planetdecred.org) with information about our projects and a blog at [blog.planetdecred.org](https://blog.planetdecred.org) for announcements and communication. PD contributors will be asked to maintain individual twitter accounts that they post updates to, and these will be syndicated via [twitter.com/planetdecred](https://twitter.com/planetdecred) . ~25 hours was put into creating the website and blog.

**Who**

Contributing to PD projects will be open to all qualifying decred contractors. Much of this work is already being performed by RG as demonstrated by the work already completed. Website front end work was done by @rickmort, @m4nnrs, and @daniellamarr. Current active dcrdata contributors on our team are @ademuanthony, @ekeh, @mkingori. All server administration tasks are currently performed by @raedah until there is someone else qualified to contribute. All work done by RG is overseen and directed by @raedah. RG will be the proposal holder and manage the proposal's budget.

**Cost**

No compensation is being requested for work that is already completed. The total cost of this proposal is $5,000. This budget would run for a period of 6 months, July 1st 2020 through Dec 31st 2020. The cost of this proposal is an upper limit. Only work completed will be billable. 

6 month budget breakdown is: 

- Server hosting: $600 ($100 per month)   (matrix, dcrdata servers)
- Server admin work: $3900 ($650 per month)
- Website planetdecred.org: $500
- -**Total** $5,000

Notes: 
- Based on feedback, items related to decredpower, local events, and dcrdata style capability have been removed from this proposal.
- We have also removed items related to 'other servers' and decided that if we choose to setup these services we will bare all costs our self for the time being.
- We have removed costs associated with planetdecred.org website improvements. Instead we've made it a minimal budget to deal with minor updates that may be needed.
