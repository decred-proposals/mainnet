The thing is, this MUST be done on the software level and MUST be equal for all \"operators\" or the DEX won't do fair trading.

The timeline and projected costs seem reasonable.\n\nWhile I do think it is a good decision to separate the core functionality from the user interface (UI) aspects in this specification, I would also suggest that the contractors performing the work keep in mind the overall intended target user experience (UX), some of which was outlined by the initial DEX proposal.  To clarify what I mean, I do not consider UX and UI as the same things.  UX is about making the interfaces useful while UI is about making them look nice.  I mention this because the available message formats, response messages, and failure mode handling will have an unavoidable impact on UX.\n\nOverall, the areas of focus for the implementation appear to cover the necessary areas for an initial backend release which has the properties discussed in the DEX proposal.","signature":"0e228e2c72aea6eeb2b661798dec1cbb3185f3cb2f0e06b1c79be444389c92487d5f80cccaef59dfe5c2f4ef1c37736fed99537e8fefec4536a3ada4abd3ca0c","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"5","receipt":"60854c5a8a975bfd26b0282b6bac63f1aaf1f846b94998ab58e24f7d8219b898ecc5d0b2d53766f777a77de7ecf8ef88d6ea8e479577db87772644f6d03b1f06","timestamp":1559551267,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
