With staking support for mobile and watch-only wallets in the works it sounds like functionality easily subsumed into DCR iOS or Android.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!","signature":"7dbf363cde247a94e1eb1c2b1639af69ea4ae9027c0fe723ff25437e088d73f4ffcc72c25c1244834bb1f505cd32889a55f376c30da071161b1d9980e51c5b03","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"1","receipt":"c5192db0432ffe08892d6f4c84c8992b0595a895e2bf84d58bf68ce1b0c85c9c29a1790adf4e4f9d20b75fd1d4e88ac8dae1a6428087792e97f351cf5cbe3a07","timestamp":1604952909,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
