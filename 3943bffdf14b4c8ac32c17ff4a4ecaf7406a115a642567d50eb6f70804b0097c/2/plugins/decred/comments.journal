With staking support for mobile and watch-only wallets in the works it sounds like functionality easily subsumed into DCR iOS or Android.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!","signature":"7dbf363cde247a94e1eb1c2b1639af69ea4ae9027c0fe723ff25437e088d73f4ffcc72c25c1244834bb1f505cd32889a55f376c30da071161b1d9980e51c5b03","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"1","receipt":"c5192db0432ffe08892d6f4c84c8992b0595a895e2bf84d58bf68ce1b0c85c9c29a1790adf4e4f9d20b75fd1d4e88ac8dae1a6428087792e97f351cf5cbe3a07","timestamp":1604952909,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This app is an outsider looking in. It could be changed to take an xpub and derive addresses from it and watch those addresses, but that is not part of this proposal. **That** functionality would certainly make more sense as part of a wallet app. Also, addresses are not something that are going to disappear. If you tell someone to send funds to \"xyz\", the funds must go to \"xyz\". Privacy obfuscates the path between the two, but in the end the address will get the funds. The same goes for a ticket commitment. It will be paid to the specified address.\n\nAs for putting it into the mobile wallet, in my opinion, watching arbitrary address is not the function of a wallet. The wallet only cares about addresses that belong to it. Does decrediton have the ability to watch random addresses? Also, if the mobile wallet did have staking, you would not be able to watch for tickets voting on your desktop or trezor wallets (unless you import the xpub). You would not be able to watch the treasury address (you could just open dcrdata though). I think this app has its niche here in that it doesn't care what it's watching.\n\nAnd one more point, it's only three clicks to input an address: app -\u003e \"+\" -\u003e scan qr. And only two actions to delete an address: app -\u003e swipe. If you were to embed this in another app it would increase the difficulty by some amount, which I think degrades the experience.","signature":"b48db8fc6288ea779fc82de55aae53a07d7480dd98f6ad3d4164911839737410e90e382adff9bd42b0d0adfcb50e536bdfb822de41e1e82ece43aee4d8b60a09","publickey":"3b528e5d87f70c355118ff473c05334d7496f1df808208328626eee96770118a","commentid":"2","receipt":"f93235f509dfeac9bd6afaa0d6dc72b5720858f9d09493b1c45c96815e2d2b67fd1536e6a34541bbf7bfff89886bdbe8c2e314749e9ddeada5f1b0b4d1bd830f","timestamp":1604966995,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It's what I do now and it is really very fast, just three actions. I urge anyone with tickets to try it out. It will be the only OP_RETURN (sstxcommitment) address for solo tickets and the second for pool tickets. Input it. Put an alias like 11/11Tik. Then press the star in the upper  right (this enables notifications) and you're set. When the ticket is voted/revoked you will know that the funds have returned to you.

This proposal seems to be a step in the right direction.  The single most requested feature I hear from VSP users is for ticket notifications, so it would be useful to be able to point users to a simple solution. The VSPs that currently provide this feature won't be able to do so as stakeholders switch to private voting. The ability to choose an explorer is particularly nice, as anyone can set up their own to maintain their privacy (as I have done). I have three minor quibbles:\n\n- I think it would be more useful to notify the users after the 256 block maturation period. Personally I want any notification on my phone to actionable. Informational notifications are nice, but should be optional.\n- The app should be made available on non-Google app stores such as F-droid (if it isn't already) for those who are on Graphene and outside of Google's survellience window.\n- Finally, this proposal should include the creation of step-by-step document on how to import a ticket address. There needs to be something to point users to and it should include where users can install the app and screenshots of how to import the ticket. I realize the Play Store page has this to some extent, but it needs to be a document that we can all point to (possibly on docs.decred.org).\n\nOther than that this proposal gets the job done, and thus has my support.","signature":"1fc06740f816ca66513076f66fb7bc90861af065aec667895e1f0be6a0077088b6521b54d6513762b6e7508e0bdbc82d4d47099fa2866bcbdb7ded627f87280d","publickey":"4674d52edfa911b862565963cb279dab090649dafd0ae45df2a0864f7b5447e3","commentid":"5","receipt":"93088146ebf1d17ac9d34547c4d7d354cb0bf4707657a4d4896db803133d7686d854dfb05222b72d31861d7c591d9c964853432e6653020a6135cf8036b90c0e","timestamp":1605459584,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
