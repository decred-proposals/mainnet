With staking support for mobile and watch-only wallets in the works it sounds like functionality easily subsumed into DCR iOS or Android.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!","signature":"7dbf363cde247a94e1eb1c2b1639af69ea4ae9027c0fe723ff25437e088d73f4ffcc72c25c1244834bb1f505cd32889a55f376c30da071161b1d9980e51c5b03","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"1","receipt":"c5192db0432ffe08892d6f4c84c8992b0595a895e2bf84d58bf68ce1b0c85c9c29a1790adf4e4f9d20b75fd1d4e88ac8dae1a6428087792e97f351cf5cbe3a07","timestamp":1604952909,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This app is an outsider looking in. It could be changed to take an xpub and derive addresses from it and watch those addresses, but that is not part of this proposal. **That** functionality would certainly make more sense as part of a wallet app. Also, addresses are not something that are going to disappear. If you tell someone to send funds to \"xyz\", the funds must go to \"xyz\". Privacy obfuscates the path between the two, but in the end the address will get the funds. The same goes for a ticket commitment. It will be paid to the specified address.\n\nAs for putting it into the mobile wallet, in my opinion, watching arbitrary address is not the function of a wallet. The wallet only cares about addresses that belong to it. Does decrediton have the ability to watch random addresses? Also, if the mobile wallet did have staking, you would not be able to watch for tickets voting on your desktop or trezor wallets (unless you import the xpub). You would not be able to watch the treasury address (you could just open dcrdata though). I think this app has its niche here in that it doesn't care what it's watching.\n\nAnd one more point, it's only three clicks to input an address: app -\u003e \"+\" -\u003e scan qr. And only two actions to delete an address: app -\u003e swipe. If you were to embed this in another app it would increase the difficulty by some amount, which I think degrades the experience.","signature":"b48db8fc6288ea779fc82de55aae53a07d7480dd98f6ad3d4164911839737410e90e382adff9bd42b0d0adfcb50e536bdfb822de41e1e82ece43aee4d8b60a09","publickey":"3b528e5d87f70c355118ff473c05334d7496f1df808208328626eee96770118a","commentid":"2","receipt":"f93235f509dfeac9bd6afaa0d6dc72b5720858f9d09493b1c45c96815e2d2b67fd1536e6a34541bbf7bfff89886bdbe8c2e314749e9ddeada5f1b0b4d1bd830f","timestamp":1604966995,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
