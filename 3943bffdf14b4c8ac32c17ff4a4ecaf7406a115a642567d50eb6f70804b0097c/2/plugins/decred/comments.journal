With staking support for mobile and watch-only wallets in the works it sounds like functionality easily subsumed into DCR iOS or Android.\n\nLooking forward to your reply!","signature":"7dbf363cde247a94e1eb1c2b1639af69ea4ae9027c0fe723ff25437e088d73f4ffcc72c25c1244834bb1f505cd32889a55f376c30da071161b1d9980e51c5b03","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"1","receipt":"c5192db0432ffe08892d6f4c84c8992b0595a895e2bf84d58bf68ce1b0c85c9c29a1790adf4e4f9d20b75fd1d4e88ac8dae1a6428087792e97f351cf5cbe3a07","timestamp":1604952909,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This app is an outsider looking in. It could be changed to take an xpub and derive addresses from it and watch those addresses, but that is not part of this proposal. **That** functionality would certainly make more sense as part of a wallet app. Also, addresses are not something that are going to disappear. If you tell someone to send funds to \"xyz\", the funds must go to \"xyz\". Privacy obfuscates the path between the two, but in the end the address will get the funds. The same goes for a ticket commitment. It will be paid to the specified address.\n\nAs for putting it into the mobile wallet, in my opinion, watching arbitrary address is not the function of a wallet. The wallet only cares about addresses that belong to it. Does decrediton have the ability to watch random addresses? Also, if the mobile wallet did have staking, you would not be able to watch for tickets voting on your desktop or trezor wallets (unless you import the xpub). You would not be able to watch the treasury address (you could just open dcrdata though). I think this app has its niche here in that it doesn't care what it's watching.\n\nAnd one more point, it's only three clicks to input an address: app -\u003e \"+\" -\u003e scan qr. And only two actions to delete an address: app -\u003e swipe. If you were to embed this in another app it would increase the difficulty by some amount, which I think degrades the experience.","signature":"b48db8fc6288ea779fc82de55aae53a07d7480dd98f6ad3d4164911839737410e90e382adff9bd42b0d0adfcb50e536bdfb822de41e1e82ece43aee4d8b60a09","publickey":"3b528e5d87f70c355118ff473c05334d7496f1df808208328626eee96770118a","commentid":"2","receipt":"f93235f509dfeac9bd6afaa0d6dc72b5720858f9d09493b1c45c96815e2d2b67fd1536e6a34541bbf7bfff89886bdbe8c2e314749e9ddeada5f1b0b4d1bd830f","timestamp":1604966995,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It's what I do now and it is really very fast, just three actions. I urge anyone with tickets to try it out.

This proposal seems to be a step in the right direction.  The single most requested feature I hear from VSP users is for ticket notifications, so it would be useful to be able to point users to a simple solution. The VSPs that currently provide this feature won't be able to do so as stakeholders switch to private voting. The ability to choose an explorer is particularly nice, as anyone can set up their own to maintain their privacy (as I have done). I have three minor quibbles:\n\n- I think it would be more useful to notify the users after the 256 block maturation period. Personally I want any notification on my phone to actionable. Informational notifications are nice, but should be optional.\n- The app should be made available on non-Google app stores such as F-droid (if it isn't already) for those who are on Graphene and outside of Google's survellience window.\n- Finally, this proposal should include the creation of step-by-step document on how to import a ticket address. There needs to be something to point users to and it should include where users can install the app and screenshots of how to import the ticket. I realize the Play Store page has this to some extent, but it needs to be a document that we can all point to (possibly on docs.decred.org).\n\nOther than that this proposal gets the job done, and thus has my support.","signature":"1fc06740f816ca66513076f66fb7bc90861af065aec667895e1f0be6a0077088b6521b54d6513762b6e7508e0bdbc82d4d47099fa2866bcbdb7ded627f87280d","publickey":"4674d52edfa911b862565963cb279dab090649dafd0ae45df2a0864f7b5447e3","commentid":"5","receipt":"93088146ebf1d17ac9d34547c4d7d354cb0bf4707657a4d4896db803133d7686d854dfb05222b72d31861d7c591d9c964853432e6653020a6135cf8036b90c0e","timestamp":1605459584,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Watching Treasury is helpful to know when contractor payments are out. Watching own tipping addresses is helpful. There can be many use cases.\n\nIt could be extended a bit to show basic stats about Decred network without adding too much code. For example, show ticket price and ticket buying activity to assist with the decision if it's the perfect time for buying tickets. The watching system can be generalized to notify about a broad set of on-chain events.\n\nImo it is good that the app is working on per-address basis and is not storing xpubs, because mobile OS is generally not as secure as desktop.\n\nMy main concern is the privacy of this implementation. Personally I would not use an app that is sending my addresses to a central server. Below are some ideas to address this issue.\n\n1\\. At the very minimum, before first use it should show a privacy warning that all entered addresses will be sent to a central server and inform about using alternative servers (ideally of user's own control).\n\n2\\. The best way to implement address tracking would be to download cfilters from Decred network (or own specified node) and use those.\n\n3\\. The next best way would be to add a new endpoint to dcrdata that serves cfilters and use those, as matheusd suggested.\n\n4\\. The next option would be to add \"ad-hoc client-side address filters\" API to dcrdata and use that. The API could work like \"give me heights and hashes for blocks in date range X-Y, each with a list of addresses that received any funds\". If implemented efficiently, the app would consume 300-400 KiB traffic for one day of blocks. Just an idea, I think doing proper cfilter support would be better.\n\n5\\. Finally, even when sending addresses to dcrdata as is, exposure to a single central server can be reduced by making a configurable _list_ of dcrdata endpoints and using random endpoints from that list. There are a few dcrdata instances out there, and not giving _all_ my addresses to one would be an improvement.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1\\. What will be the UX flow for using the app with vspd staking, when all voting addresses will be different? And what if I purchase a dozen of tickets at once?\n\n2\\. Did itswisdomagain agree to do the thorough review?\n\n3\\. Do you have a timeline for adding the app on F-Droid or at least providing an APK?\n\nThanks.","signature":"aa9d3d3c3f8d044537b3e9db692dc8fc2f4311848ced2da3df11dcf11ab6a059c4be6363d7d393e524b4d09522be672f33e86a0f59460574bfb833bcb25aed0a","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"10","receipt":"971fd93f3179baaedbfccf3c4fdd2fe4f074f3eec82f46a6c1477c81e1162338f43933f57af4ddf9719e55a6bf60f7662a0c930f6af6900db14f37bb38587203","timestamp":1605648515,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This proposal is already locked in, and I wasn't planning on doing too much more than updating everything, but your suggestions will be taken to heart and I will see what I can do.\n\nAnswers:\n\u003e 1. What will be the UX flow for using the app with vspd staking, when all voting addresses will be different? And what if I purchase a dozen of tickets at once?\n\nCurrently, you would need to input every commitment address separately. I will make that at least a little easier with \"scan a ticket\", hopefully, so the address and an alias are fetched automatically. Do many people have twelve tickets? I mean, that's awesome, but they are already buying in batch, I don't know if this app would be as useful for them in the first place. I would need input from such a person to assess their needs.\n\n\u003e 2. Did itswisdomagain agree to do the thorough review?\n\nYes! I have his \"sure.\" He's knows decred and has a lot of experience with mobile. He's perfect for the task.\n\n\u003e 3.
