However, from what I've seen in this proposal (and based on some personal evolving thoughts on the future of marketing Decred) I'm voting **YES** to this proposal for these reasons:\n\n**Approach:**\n- This approach is aggressive, but tasteful - within boundaries of what I'd consider \"Decred quality / expectations\" \n- Along this vein - the aggressive approach is something that's been lacking within the project because we've always viewed it as tacky / prohibitively expensive. This looks like a quality approach to get out there and cut through the incessant noise in the crypto space\n- This marketing approach pairs two things Decred advocates care about: (1) Education and (2) Tech\n\n**Team:**\n- Team is tenacious and excited about doing the work: have already done test trials, built the site for free, and constantly ideating\n- Team is competent and already familiar with Decred\n\n**Cost**\n- $1,000 / month is cheap for experimenting with a new marketing tactic\n\nI say we let these marketing mercenaries have a go at this","signature":"ecf07012a47fae2eaefdc36266ba05145b0eac87238fe3ac76263d10e4c8f555acf20e8e621d1e2e78b5987d2c9d8af153755650b2e3dc43f4b76a36ae6e300b","publickey":"8f9fa531b543c6e0b805a1abcc858400f8316cd937785c40e36f4d05171e83b5","commentid":"1","receipt":"9953bdc60e8fec3cb1fc104d9dbd4c470f7fc73d029564e6fb1c9af88323004b8f193e3512f0aba69646bfbef4e5de5c56388a7b7749b855d36101205d12e10f","timestamp":1600286338,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
