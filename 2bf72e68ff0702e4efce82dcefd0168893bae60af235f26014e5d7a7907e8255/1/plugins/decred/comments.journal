For now we assume the strategy \"tag your friends\" which will bring in new people. We already had people who are quite new to crypto in those comments. Imho, important is then to interact, eg. welcome them with additional comment. We started including country flags if we knew which country they are from, which immediately creates [small] relationship. We will think about more stuff on the go and experiment. Eg. we can also try \"tag someone who is not following @withdecred/@decredproject yet\". \n\n2. For now we used https://twitter-winner.appspot.com/, which is free and open source tool. I tried it couple of times for \"dry run\" and it gave me enough randomness for what we are doing here. If this strategy proves to be working and we will want to scale this further, if somebody feels like creating pseudo-random selection by reading some hashes from the blockchain using that to determine winner, I am all for it.","signature":"ccb0696e826e442df8a43defc0fe44b6288783be505b4831e424c5e9f5bbcfe1786be1ec756339d9d93a079e7d53101852f778e4844cbac8aa04b3bbfc14e60f","publickey":"ab30c62fdee8ec6e89429481acd652a3501d166383ffd46b57fd9d65a4d2b138","commentid":"4","receipt":"48d2d6f01cc5116db99a8b95616f4ae70c06431c540a5d4376f2af95323c33883e33bfcce0f2913511c211f07c0aeb64586d40472d9065af97213b360a76d909","timestamp":1600329602,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
