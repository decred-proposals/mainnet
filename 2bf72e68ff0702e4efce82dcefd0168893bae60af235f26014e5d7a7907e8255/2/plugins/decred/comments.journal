For now we assume the strategy \"tag your friends\" which will bring in new people. We already had people who are quite new to crypto in those comments. Imho, important is then to interact, eg. welcome them with additional comment. We started including country flags if we knew which country they are from, which immediately creates [small] relationship. We will think about more stuff on the go and experiment. Eg. we can also try \"tag someone who is not following @withdecred/@decredproject yet\". \n\n2. For now we used https://twitter-winner.appspot.com/, which is free and open source tool. I tried it couple of times for \"dry run\" and it gave me enough randomness for what we are doing here.

Focus/channel: In recent months, every time when there were more \"bulky\" marketing proposals with less clear plan, there was a pushback by the community of \"make it more clear\". This is one of more proposals coming with goal to isolate budget and focus on one specific channel and tactic per one proposal.\n\n2. I love that you posted the suggestion of potential new channel to try! I am familiar with Twitter, I am familiar with fact that this strategy work, I know how to execute it properly. I am also looking at publish0x and Quora - please, do come forward if you have experience with these or other platforms which we can experiment with. Eg. Exitus mentioned 4chan.\n\nWe are working on this in our free time besides full-time job, we can't cover everything. Saying that, I encourage other people to step-up and create new proposal for other channels! I will gladly help brainstorm ideas if needed.\n\n3. I put \"Stakeholder-governed sound money\" on website intentionally as a) It seems to have good support in core community (Matrix), and b) we can test it with newcomers and ask/watch new people in Discord/Telegram - how they respond to it. Whatever the RFP process will end up with, we will sync-up this site with the new messaging.\n\nMy feelings are very much agnostic to which channel(s) and which strategies will eventually work. My goal is to help find the right channels + right strategy to achieve sustainable growth model.","signature":"4efdc7c9913d3b333b597b67d542fca0011b49a2684fba85eb351d1eda9aa6a6ab993804f48777a8b31e06745d171078a679f6539eabf3f0e3fe066a86db4307","publickey":"ab30c62fdee8ec6e89429481acd652a3501d166383ffd46b57fd9d65a4d2b138","commentid":"7","receipt":"494120bb988afd800c433bf144a4be85ba02113c1b33e8f0c47b568f615a2386ee027bc142800e29e073a9d87438ea6a3230fdcd0116a1a816fedac5254e9a00","timestamp":1600364494,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
