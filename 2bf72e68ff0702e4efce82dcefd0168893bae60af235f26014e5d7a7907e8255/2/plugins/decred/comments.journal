For now we assume the strategy \"tag your friends\" which will bring in new people. We already had people who are quite new to crypto in those comments. Imho, important is then to interact, eg. welcome them with additional comment. We started including country flags if we knew which country they are from, which immediately creates [small] relationship. We will think about more stuff on the go and experiment. Eg. we can also try \"tag someone who is not following @withdecred/@decredproject yet\". \n\n2. For now we used https://twitter-winner.appspot.com/, which is free and open source tool. I tried it couple of times for \"dry run\" and it gave me enough randomness for what we are doing here.

Focus/channel: In recent months, every time when there were more \"bulky\" marketing proposals with less clear plan, there was a pushback by the community of \"make it more clear\". This is one of more proposals coming with goal to isolate budget and focus on one specific channel and tactic per one proposal.\n\n2. I love that you posted the suggestion of potential new channel to try! I am familiar with Twitter, I am familiar with fact that this strategy work, I know how to execute it properly. I am also looking at publish0x and Quora - please, do come forward if you have experience with these or other platforms which we can experiment with. Eg. Exitus mentioned 4chan.\n\nWe are working on this in our free time besides full-time job, we can't cover everything. Saying that, I encourage other people to step-up and create new proposal for other channels! I will gladly help brainstorm ideas if needed.\n\n3. I put \"Stakeholder-governed sound money\" on website intentionally as a) It seems to have good support in core community (Matrix), and b) we can test it with newcomers and ask/watch new people in Discord/Telegram - how they respond to it. Whatever the RFP process will end up with, we will sync-up this site with the new messaging.\n\nMy feelings are very much agnostic to which channel(s) and which strategies will eventually work. My goal is to help find the right channels + right strategy to achieve sustainable growth model.","signature":"4efdc7c9913d3b333b597b67d542fca0011b49a2684fba85eb351d1eda9aa6a6ab993804f48777a8b31e06745d171078a679f6539eabf3f0e3fe066a86db4307","publickey":"ab30c62fdee8ec6e89429481acd652a3501d166383ffd46b57fd9d65a4d2b138","commentid":"7","receipt":"494120bb988afd800c433bf144a4be85ba02113c1b33e8f0c47b568f615a2386ee027bc142800e29e073a9d87438ea6a3230fdcd0116a1a816fedac5254e9a00","timestamp":1600364494,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This idea is to spread the $DCR network effect via an **earned giveaway**. \n\nDecred began its distribution with an airdrop, and after 4 years, it's a worthwhile experiment to reward specific activities like downloading the Decrediton wallet. I'll help where I can, as I've found this group of guys to genuinely care about Decred.\n\nThis is a pure grassroots outreach experiment. By the community and for the community.","signature":"4358c8dc4de2f1a3ee6ff14356e5975c7eb26e9ee534d5820b5140e5181f886ddfcf98df222a065ecfe47d8dcae73d557883c50a504ab7ca5fb9a7c198756e03","publickey":"7bf956c858f4e123edba7c87b37bf819200c0588abc1ac00d5f8e0f0732bd3e4","commentid":"8","receipt":"4e8f22ca77e997d17220184181808d1d6f9af7a81e62b9fed4a096b51c247336a166e32325e8bf5c488d18a7bab47a3e28d93ebe3af977a8450d48c339e38903","timestamp":1600488930,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here are some ideas.\n\n- when I visited this website I didn't stay more than 2 seconds on it, didn't read any of the articles, and didn't plan to come back.  I came back by accident when I clicked on the proposal under Governance and thought \"Oh, this is that?\" If the front page didn't have 303 words on it but only 5, \"Decred is better than Bitcoin\", the message would be 60x more potent and would make me stop longer than 2 seconds. \n\n- if you add the \"linear scale\" image https://twitter.com/Ammarooni/status/1307716509071011844 on the front page I can see why Decred might be better *without spending any time to read anything*. I get the main point in less than 5 seconds. Now you have me 5 seconds on the website.\n\n- I didn't like the Twitter handle @withdecred much but maybe it's ok. It sounds like picking teams - you're either with us or without us - a recipe to divide a community. @usedecred might be better and it tells me what to do with Decred. I'm not supposed to think hard if I should buy and hold it for investment, I'm supposed to use it. Or @buydecred.\n\n- if the site has a link with the price, how many Decreds I get for one Bitcoin, and a link to some non-KYC exchange where I can get some right now, like https://swapspace.co https://godex.io/, then between seconds 6 and 10 I could be thinking of buying.  This is better than spending 21 minutes to read articles or closing the browser tab.\n\n- add a link to something I can buy with Decred or to least one store that accepts Decred. I can buy plane tickets and gold with other coins.","signature":"abfc556b9af1139fbdfea0c2667c9e547fc76f203e0302f3667e42d3487127babe5a9ece32e1dce3e289bf6f87185499f6e94154c0146276d2885da05d3b9a0f","publickey":"c2a61bde5331bc52a7f83bb4d0e7f2d20909b3a6877cc1bbc4e17c03ea300eac","commentid":"9","receipt":"cf7a37d854aefd7025e9558ba3f2429ff5957fdbf1967df1fb6746ac2ea044a875788ecddffcb1c69dc80f6ec8a00c2b314505d1b27f74464cd57eb6a858d00d","timestamp":1600639421,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But I also wrote that not everybody will like the website. What is important for the success of the project is following: If we send to the website newcomers to learn about Decred and we collect feedback from them (one-on-one is best; or we derive the feedback based on measured data), we can improve the content step by step to achieve good successful onboarding rate (people who read it want to buy some DCR).\n\n- We had a conversation today on Twitter rg. the attack cost (thanks for everybody who participated). After reading it, you will see (as me) that the topic is a bit more complex and using such extreme charts as linear comparison in the current state might work for some people, but may have more drawbacks. I would rather like to create fair comparison with all the context and publish such content. I talked today to Luke and we will improve that comparison after his priority tasks are finished and shipped.\n\n- Rg. naming of the website, I explained my reasoning in the FAQ section. I'm not sure if you read that. I discussed the naming with few people, then we made the decision.\n\n- Thanks for the suggestions rg. non-KYC exchanges, I will certainly add them to the \"Buy\" page.\n\n- Thanks also for the last suggestion, it might be good to point out what you can already purchase withDecred.\n\nAlso note that this is only a part of awareness strategy which we want to execute. If this approach works, we will continue doing it. If it doesn't we will not continue. \n\nI mentioned already that I'm pretty much agnostic to which channel works, I want to help find an awareness strategy that works.\n\nPS: What is the goal that you would suggest for the project/website?","signature":"743fe171cb3978856c9e362b7f822c031832c176949fbf23534efb41d0b7d361cf5f147a7ad41033827caee3938c3354e68b7ea697c2baefc41c7cc00d8b2b07","publickey":"ab30c62fdee8ec6e89429481acd652a3501d166383ffd46b57fd9d65a4d2b138","commentid":"10","receipt":"a5b9a70d8ce743affb74c3911b5ac2755653c68bb4818b7bc88b3a70b5b94473c55922a932e296ff9937e49481f2c7a82eec61478d405b6274c203ece09fb001","timestamp":1600710735,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
