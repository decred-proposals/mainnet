Grassroots Marketing - growing the Decred community (withDecred.org)

According to the preferences of the wider community, this is a bottom-up effort of several people from the community. The goal of this effort is to find a scalable approach to onboard new users to Decred through education, awareness, gamification and network effects.

## Context

In today's world with information being pushed from all angles, people's attention span in the online space can be just minutes, sometimes even just seconds. Providing the right amount of information with a combination of gamification and/or network effects can raise people's attention with the goal to the get the desired information across.

We believe the Decred team is building incredible technology, but due to an increasingly competitive cryptocurrency market with millions of USD thrown into marketing, Decred was not able to stay trending.

In 2017, the ICO craze took the majority of consumer attention. 2020 is the year where DeFi (Yield Farming and increasingly governance tokens) is taking the front pages of crypto news outlets.

We believe that we need to find a scalable approach to onboarding new users to Decred's community by applying proven strategies to find which one will yield scalable results.

## Listen to my podcast for more thoughts

I am aware that this sole activity will not solve all problems, but it aims to rejuvenate existing community and to bring new stakeholders to the community. 

There is an extended plan being worked on in the background with several additional well-known community members and we will unveil next concrete activities soon.

I want to encourage everybody who is interested in growing Decred community to listen to my reasoning, my experience and my results achieved in marketing in the Staked podcast which was published today (Sep 23th). I talk about how we can achieve bigger network effect with simple activities. 

You can start at around 20th-25th minute if you are short on time.

## What is withDecred.org / Why we built the website

We built a new website [https://withDecred.org](https://withdecred.org) with one single goal - to provide an onboarding portal with brief yet comprehensive articles detailing the most important information needed for newly interested users.  

We wrote 4 articles about most important aspects of Decred. These articles are organized into a sequence - **a** **funnel** with 2 specific goals → becoming **Decreducated** and **Acquiring $DCR**. 

**The content structure**

1. Decred 101
2. Hybrid consensus
3. Staking & Governance
4. What's next (DEX, LN, private staking, ..)
5. How to get $DCR (not an article, rather a "call-to-action" page)

While working on the content, we worked with a "Target Persona" - a person somewhat familiar with crypto market, at least familiar with Bitcoin.

We used this approach to write a content "shallow" enough for users to understand terminology but "deep" enough to understand Decred strengths.

The content in the shape how it's written may not be liked by everybody from the community and that's okay. We are a diverse community and everybody likes something different based on the depth of his knowledge and personal preferences.   

This is **the 1st iteration (1st version)**.

We will work on improving the content upon feedback and data - to increase interaction and conversions - by measuring if people read the content, how they work with the site and if they read through the whole funnel. 

**Based on this data, we can objectively asses if the content does what was intended.**

We will follow a simple, but important strategy:

1. Create assumptions
2. Write content based on assumptions
3. Publish, bring attention of users
4. Measure data for certain period
5. Evaluate results, identify weak spots
6. Adjust assumptions → back to Step 1

This proposal mainly targets to help bring attention of users.

## What was already done?

As we believe that our approach has merits, we already invested dozens of hours into:

- Brainstorming, creation of "target persona"
- Content writing, feedback, refining
- Designing UI for the website
- Implementation & deployment of the website
- Research of analytics software

By estimation, all this work is worth around $7000-8000 USD or more.

**All of this work was done as free contribution and we do NOT ask for any back-pay.**

## Budget

We are asking for $5000 USD budget to distribute among new users by pseudo-random selection via "earned distribution". We estimate this budget will be enough for 5 months.

We will publish tweets on Twitter and encourage people to interact with and share our content. 

This is an example of such tweets:

*"Earn $20/$30/$50 worth of $DCR by helping people learn about Decred. Follow @decredproject and @withDecred, like and retweet this post. Comment why you like Decred. We will pick somebody by end of the week."*

*"We are celebrating release of Decred DEX. Earn $50 USD in $DCR by helping people learn about Decred DEX. Follow @decredproject and @withDecred, like and retweet this post. We will pick somebody on Friday."*

*"We are celebrating release of private staking. Earn $50 USD in $DCR by helping people learn about Decred private staking. Follow @decredproject and @withDecred, download Decrediton wallet and post a screenshot of you wallet address below."*

*"We are celebrating release of Lightning Network (LN). We will pick 5 random people who retweet this and send them a Lightning Torch worth $10 via LN. We encourage people to pass it forward. Post a screenshot of your Decrediton LN wallet address in comment."*

We will experiment with the amount to drive best engagement per reward. We plan to start with smaller amounts of $20-30 USD.

We will experiment with different type of messaging and we will support awareness of newly published software which is scheduled for release later this year and next year - Decred DEX, Lighting network, Private staking, etc.

We are also asking for for an additional $297 USD per month for following:

- $27 USD per month to pay expenses for running 2 servers
- $100 USD per month to do content adjustments based on feedback
- $170 to plan, create and publish the content on Twitter and engage with community on Twitter

Budget summary

- $5000 to distribute to people
- $297 * 5 months = $1485

**Budget Total $6,485 USD**

### Examples of existing campaigns

You can see big engagement with example/trial posts below. We already ran 2 campaigns with tangible results and funded with our own funds.

By running these 2 campaigns (thanks to all in the community who participated!), we grew the account from under 100 followers to 266 followers in the matter of 10 days.

We can leverage this community to share other important Decred content - updates from software development, Checkmate's and Permabull's research, Decred Drive updates, Exitus'es videos, etc. 

### Working with existing community

We want to work with existing community members who lead community growth in different regions - Latam, Canada, US, Poland; and we already reached out to some of them while working on this project.

We built this site also for them - to help simplify and streamline onboarding of new users. 

The website internals are configured to support multiple languages and after some initial feedback from newcomers, we can proceed to translations and host them on the same website.

## FAQ

- **Why a new website instead of using [Decred.org](http://decred.org)?** First of all we want to say that the documentation on Decred.org is high quality and complete. However there are few obstacles which make it ineffective for what we are trying to achieve, namely:
    - It is organized in a catalog-like structure, not a funnel-like structure.
    - The content is too wide-ranging - user can get distracted or overwhelmed while consuming it.
    - There is no tracking - the fact is that at the moment, we don't know if the content is read, how many people read the content or which country are they located in. All of this information is crucial to understand how the content is digested and to be able to mare future improvements and revisions based on data.
    - Making changes to the official Decred website also requires consensus of many people and requires translations etc. This takes too much time which would be contra-productive to our effort.
    - Having a separate website allows us to move quickly and experiment, without the risk of damaging the credibility of the official Decred website.
- **Analytics? We don't want tracking!** We discussed this topic with core community members in Matrix chat most of the concerns can be summarized as being opposed to:
    - 3rd party tracking software with purpose of user-information gathering (eg. Google Analytics, Facebook tracking pixel, etc.)
    - 3rd party CDN (Content Delivery Network) which tracks user data, namely Cloudflare or Amazon CDN

    Based on these concerns, we deployed a **1st-party privacy-preserving analytics software** which is deployed on our **own server** and **encrypts data at REST**. Not IP address, nor other PII (Personally Identifiable Information) are stored. You can read more at [https://count.ly/your-data-your-rules](https://count.ly/your-data-your-rules)

- **Why new Twitter account, instead of @decredproject?** This is similar to the reasoning of not using official Decred website. Also, with respect to desired decentralization, separate Twitter account follows the path which we are preaching.
- **Why "withDecred.org", not something like "LearnDecred.org"?** There are more plans to build tools and more content on the portal, to give you a sense, we are talking about:
    - [learn.withDecred.org](http://learn.withDecred.org) (can be used as alias for this content)
    - [earn.withDecred.org](http://earn.withDecred.org) (can be used to link to "work as contractor")
    - [vouchers.withDecred.org](http://vouchers.withDecred.org) (create and/or redeem $DCR vouchers)
    - [stake.withDecred.org](http://stake.withDecred.org) (tutorial how to stake with Decrediton)
    - [vote.withDecred.org](http://vote.withDecred.org) (tutorial on how to vote in Politeia, Pi* related content; possibly alternative interface to Politeia)
    - etc.
- **Are you aware the Treasury doesn't pay in advance?** Yes, payments the following month are okay. We will deal with the cashflow difference.

Edit 1: corrected typos
Edit 2: added link to podcast
Edit 3: added screenshots

## Notes to attached screenshots

I was thinking how to attract more easily the people who will be tagged by their friends. I don't expect all people to open the website of the Twitter account running the giveaways, so how can we communicate Decred's strengths to those people to raise interest - if they spend only 6-7 seconds looking at the tweet where they have been tagged? 

This is what I figured out, example:
*"Earn $20 in $DCR. Go to https://withDecred.org/win, **take a screenshot, attach it to this post** and tag 1 person. Follow @decredproject and @withDecred. We will pick somebody by end of the week."*

Why? People who are tagged will see the screenshot right away with Decred's message. You can have a look on attached screenshots how this would look like.

Attaching these screenshots will also raise much more attention seeing this in your Twitter Timeline feed. Nobody does it like this (at least not now). I'm certain that this will increase the awareness better.

The QR code will encode the hash of the last Decred block which will be as **Proof of Time** to prevent fraudulent entries.
