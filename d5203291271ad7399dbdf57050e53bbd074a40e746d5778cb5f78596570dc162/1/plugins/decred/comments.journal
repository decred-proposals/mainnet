There's so much here to comment on, that I cannot even begin to address. \nYou mention UNESCO, Black Lives Matter, the ozone layer, Iberian lynx, animal extinction, ecology, mindfulness...\nThen you talk about your life story... It's a confusing stream of consciousness.\n\nI think you're on the wrong website, perhaps what confused you is that the other one also begins with the letter P: namely, Patreon.com\nThat is the website you're looking for... create a blog to share your thoughts with the world and then try to get funding from Patreon\nBecause this has very little to do with DCR, a CRYPTOCURRENCY. You need to show your work would benefit the adoption of the currency.\n\n","signature":"3ff4b22f41ed608c46494865be83040747a3a6448be20088d246eb5e9080e047b7632021d662ba8a0c3575eea077d7c9895cf1563680ab71747df697de06690d","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"29c9d6e0c8cc98ddca409b6a9f726303a7bd672d2914340b13bf694fdd181a5f1eca147b8cecebf9a06016356a68c074ef23e6315803427c17f730e09bf9fd0c","timestamp":1581263182,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
