Decred - Creative Economy I + D + I [Research and Education proposal]

Hi everyone!!

My name is OscarGamboae, I am a freak from Irapuato Guanajuato, Mexico, but I try to be more and more human, communicologist, growth hacker, eco cultural promoter, artist off the list, lately working as a business development, he participated in various projects cultural, movement, civil associations, artistic festivals, my strange life led me to investigate about life, and these last 3 years I have been dedicated to doing research "without an end , even ”, where I deal with topics of considerable interest in the daily life of the different societies in LATAM, and thus be able to accelerate their social, cultural and economic development, through various strategies on communication, marketing, growth hacking, eco life "mindfulness", hackingmind, adventure, travel, art, sustainability, development and lots of fun, to be able to devote time to what that really matters. Loving and not stop smiling, with our special people...


Taking into account the education and culture we receive at LATAM, we are working together with various Civil Associations, to achieve, motivate, inspire, support, collaborate and co-create with various creative communities to design and develop various networking projects that encourage communities to develop assets and / or professional services that use blockchain and cashless payment methods such as DCR, to increase the supply and demand of the economy, thanks to the new active users and technology that the DCR team facilitates. as the newest Lighting Network.

My research will continue by JULY 2020 at two festivals in EUROPE, Hungary at OzoraFestival.org and in Portugal at Boomfestival.org, this latest “anti-system” festival awarded by UNESCO (ONU & ONU HABITTAT) as “the champions of sustainability” in the year 2015, and that are part of the 17 SDGs Sustainable Development Goals, driven by which the theme of this year 2020 is #Antrophocene, a combination of anthropology, sustainability, planet and human action.


"There is no Plan B, or better, Planet B. We have to live on this planet and save it."

The statement is from scientist Martin Rees. Also in the middle of the scientific community, in February 2000, Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer declared that we live in a new geological era, the Anthropocene.

By containing the prefix anthropos, which means "human being", the term defines a period marked by human action with a profound effect on the environment.

They designated the beginning of the Anthropocene in 1784, when James Watt patented the steam locomotive. The beginning of this era is controversial. Was it the colonization of America, the sea routes that connected the continents in the 15th / 16th century, the silk route or the birth of industrial capitalism? The atomic bomb, the great acceleration of consumption in the mid-twentieth century or the capitalist explosion in Asia?

Geological era or not, scientists are aware of the human impact on Earth.

The Earth has existed for approximately 4.5 billion years, this historical moment being unique because our species, homo sapiens, is aware that it can change the planet.

We are so numerous that we can strip ourselves to the point of becoming a sterile world for future generations. In contrast, knowledge and technology can eventually help us reverse the situation.

Everything depends on us. Everyone, today, here, now.

The ability to be visionaries is the trigger. The solution may be in the innate faculty of any human being: imagination.

The visionary epithet is to imagine future scenarios and make them a reality. It applies to people, groups, organizations, communities, cities, countries, festivals that, despite the seemingly desperate situation, still manage to do something, find answers, imagine solutions, think creatively, generate ideas to combat apathy: alternative ways of impact

The capacity of the Earth comes from our lifestyles and will never be sustainable if 9800 million people consume as much energy, water, meat, fish or other resources as in industrialized countries. 50 years ago, the planetary population was 3500 billion. Today there are 7600 billion and the forecasts point to 9800 billion in 2050. Urban pressure will increase, in 2030 cities such as Lagos (Nigeria) or São Paulo (in Brazil) will have populations over 30 million. By 2050, 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities.

How to feed both homo sapiens and animals (often raised in deplorable conditions) that you consume?

To produce a kilo of cereal, we need one to three tons of water; A kilo of meat needs fifteen tons. Between 2010 and 2050, the environmental effects of the food system can increase by 50-90 percent.

Conventional agriculture, which is the world's largest user of water (70 percent), proposes to increase production. This intensification will bring more herbicides and chemical fertilizers that will kill soil microorganisms that are the basis of life on Earth.

There is scientific evidence that suggests that the organic production method can meet the needs of a growing population, which can provide conscious approaches to deal with nature and animal life in an anachronistic sense with conventional agriculture.

The Anthropocene is not, therefore, a uniform era.

We went through the so-called “4th industrial revolution” and it seems a distant past: in 1820, only 12% of people could read. In 2018, the figure increased to 83%. In 1800, only 43% of children reached five years of age, today they are 96%. And the world has moved quickly to meet material needs, in 1820 94 out of 100 people lived in conditions of extreme poverty (estimated at $ 1.9 dollars / day) and in 2015 that figure was 10 out of 100.

Socially, populist parties have more than tripled their support in Europe in the last 20 years. Populist leaders are spreading messages of hate and confrontation. In Asia, "algorithmic governance," as Martin Chorzempa says, is already on the move with hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras to control its most populous country.

In contrast, in the corporate world, several companies launch “green” advertising with a purpose, cultivating new mantras that mix late capitalism with a new awareness of the planet: triple end result; change management; zero marginal cost; circular economy; theory or full attention clean capitalism; ...

Do these new mantras mean a growing concern for planetary values? Are they marketing maneuvers? Or ways to improve productivity in societies that continue to be governed by the ideology of growth?

The Anthropocene not only leaves an indelible mark on the blue planet, but it is also modifying the human being: the outbreak of artificial intelligence, dataism or biotechnology.

We have stopped valuing privacy and are happy with the easy positive reinforcement (like, disgust, sharing, friend, not friend, emojis) of others in the face of the moments of our lives. The deregulated environments of the principles of good coexistence, since some social networks are a pipe for hate speech and intimidation.

Social platforms can separate us and unite us. In this volatile ocean there are causes that are being mobilized: #ExtinctionRebellion; #BlackLivesMatter; #Occupy; #TahrirSquare; #UmbrellaRevolution; # YouthForClimate ... In parallel, the #ReclaimSocial movement points to a positive online coexistence in the context of frequent curious judgments.

We talk about superhumans, the transfer of consciousness to computers or machines smarter than us. On the other hand, there has never been so much scientific evidence about the benefits of human contact with nature, or the practices of yoga, sports, meditation, wellness, ikigai, hygge.

Our ability to save the planet coincides with the power we have to destroy it.

Human action cannot be destined to fatalism and we all face facts about the destruction of ecosystems.

It is no secret that many species are at risk. From another perspective, the giant panda is no longer in danger.

The reintroduction of the Iberian lynx in Portugal and Spain demonstrates that the extinction of animals is not an irreversible destination and is largely in our hands. It was with this awareness of the collective effort that harmful chemicals were banned, which apparently resulted in the reduction of the ozone hole.

Decred can benefit from transmitting its own ideology to new users as an advance in human, artistic and decentralized progress, through the active participation of various parts of the world and the artistic universe, through the development of cultural projects, encouraging groups to unify efforts and to be able to promote the different communities in cities around LATAM and the world.

Proposal:

This proposal will be carried out 7 months of research and to be able to deepen the different topics of interest and investigate the social, educational and economic potential, to be able to include in your daily life crypto companies, assets, especially DCR and offer to the different communities of LATAM a human governance and a decentralized monetary economy, for the free development of sustainable autonomous communities in the world.

The objectives are:

- Promote the development of powerful assets that can promote new networks of well-informed ambassadors in general, to develop new opportunities for social, educational and economic development.

- Promote the development and knowledge of artistic DCR communities.

- Create content for the development implementation of DCR media and journal.

- Promote the adaptability of DCR as a Lightning Network in different communities of the artistic universe of LATAM.

- Boost the economic development (micro-macro economic) of the new DCR communities in LATAM and the world.

- Research on: “Decred Land; Blockchain City, the first crypto city in Mexico. ”

- Proposal for a Work Plan 2020-2026 México - LATAM



Research and publication topics:

In my research I touch very diverse and very deep topics, mainly of philosophy and circular economy, of colors (Rainbow) mainly in LATAM, such as the green, blue, orange, red and black economy, the new urban agenda, 17 Objectives of Sustainable developments, Art everywhere, creative cities, sustainable tourism, UNESCO, ONU HABITTAT, BigData, Smart Cities, Blockchain Cities, development of innovation and infrastructure, music, Festivals, RAVES, Tic´s, cashless payments.


When relevant or necessary, in research I will link with Decred's existing research to maximize the impact of community assets.

The writings will be published in Medium and will be shared on social networks through coordination with the Decred community.

Chronology:

A series of publications (from 3 to 6 writings, backed with a presence on social networks) during the next 7 months (March-September).

Cost:

$ 3k in arrears for the first publication and fundamental research.

$ 12k for 7 months of future research and publications.

$ 3 k Flights Mexico - Hungary - Portugal - Mexico (https://travelbybit.com)

Invoices will be billed monthly through the contractor management system.

Total: $ 18,000 USD IN DCR for next 7 Months Research  and different proposal. :) 

Justification:

Since I met DCR, it was something very strange, since I unwittingly realized what I was looking for, and I felt confident enough to tell them a lot or little of the knowledge I had at that time about my projects and research, since that from the first contact, I realized the incredible potential since in my head, just at that time I was thinking something so huge, and it was indeed a somewhat strange honor, but I know it is no coincidence.

Since the age of 15 (my last 9 years) I worked in entertainment and culture, and my last 3 years worked as a creative director in projects in the industry, I quit, spent all my savings to work on a cultural project that could not be done for various situations, but that brought me here, and knowing the decred.org project, was something that completely changed the vision of the project, to achieve a more global and unified transformation.

For the past 9 months I have been living as a "digital nomad", which is very funny, although sometimes it is extremely difficult due to various situations, which has led me to stop researching and deepening in a way I would like, given that the wear and tear Mental, physical and economic is too much, I had little energy to continue my research.

I am approaching this through a monthly invoice / pulse check instead of an hourly payment or a lump sum, since deep academic dives can be more like sharing the mind rather than sharing the time. A $ 9k agreement billed monthly for the next 7 months, and a 3k advance in arrears for the first publication and fundamental research and 3K flights via https://travelbybit.com is a better representative of that relationship.


An investment in persuasive and educational assets will be more than profitable, since it will allow new investors to enter Decred with greater users, creating a new supply and demand, thanks to each project carried out in the new DCR communities at LATAM and the world

Research empowers current Decred community ambassadors in outreach discussions, as there are several social dimensions that have not yet been written.

This macro-research will serve as a complement to the technical and theoretical chain research currently carried out by existing community contractors. The combination of technical and macroeconomic narratives will aggravate Decred's value proposition.

Risks and mitigators:

I am not a developer, but I am a communicator, with extensive experience in various global issues and I need to guarantee field research and create the possibilities of developing new communities of DCR ambassadors in new unexplored communities.

This will be achieved by validating the documents with known members of the community prior to publication. This will also help to edit the content for maximum impact.

Unlike a software delivery that can be measured by specifications, this proposal involves qualitative and quantitative research. As you explored these issues, your themes can be expanded or modified, for adaptation in the new diverse DCR communities around LATAM and the world.
 
I believe that this adaptability will turn out to be a positive net result for the projects that are being found to be developed
.
This is my first proposal, I based on several that I saw in POLITEIA and I am very happy to be part of this community, and I hope to contribute in all possible aspects, I hope to receive your comments, doubts, ideas, suggestions and reflections.

With much love, for humanity, for a better world for everyone, de la banda pa la banda, Oscar Gamboa lml
