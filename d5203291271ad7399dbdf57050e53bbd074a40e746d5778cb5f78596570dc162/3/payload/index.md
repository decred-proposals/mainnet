Hi everyone!!

My name is OscarGamboae, I am a freak from Irapuato Guanajuato, Mexico, but I try to be more and more human, communicologist, sociologist, growth hacker, eco cultural promoter, artist off the list, lately working as a business development, he participated in various projects cultural, movement, civil associations, artistic festivals, my strange life led me to investigate about life, and these last 3 years I have been dedicated to doing research "without an end , even ”, where I deal with topics of considerable interest in the daily life of the different societies in LATAM, and thus be able to accelerate their social, cultural and economic development, through various strategies on "communication, marketing, growth hacking, eco life, mindfulness, hackingmind, adventure, travel, art, sustainability, development and lots of fun", to be able to devote time to what that really matters. Loving and not stop smiling, with our special people...

Taking into account the education and culture we receive at LATAM, we are working together with various Civil Associations, to achieve, motivate, inspire, support, collaborate and co-create with various creative communities to design and develop various networking projects that encourage communities to develop assets and / or professional services that use blockchain and cashless payment methods such as DCR, to increase the supply and demand of the economy, thanks to the new active users and technology that the DCR team facilitates. as the newest Lighting Network.

My research will continue by JULY 2020 at two festivals in EUROPE, Hungary at OzoraFestival.org and in Portugal at Boomfestival.org, this latest “anti-system” festival but awarded by UNESCO (ONU & ONU HABITTAT) as “the champions of sustainability” in the year 2015, and that are part of the 17 SDGs Sustainable Development Goals, driven by which the theme of this year 2020 is **#Antrophocene,** a combination of anthropology, sustainability, planet and human action.

**Proposal**
This proposal will be carried out during the next 10 months of research and be able to deepen the different topics of interest and investigate the social, educational and economic potential, in order to include crypto companies, entrepreneurs, gastronomy, artists, tourism events, assets, especially DCR in their daily lives and offer the different LATAM communities a human governance and a decentralized monetary economy, for the free development of sustainable autonomous communities in the world.

**The objectives are:**

- **Meetups and events **that promote the use of DCR currency in unexplored communities.

- **Promote the development** of assets and projects that can promote new networks of well-informed DCR ambassadors and communities in general, to develop new opportunities for social, educational and economic development.

-  **Write content** for the development implementation of DCR media and journal.

**- Webinars: **A webinar is a training content in video format that is imparted through the internet. The first broadcast is live, but logically it can be recorded and reissued later. This content, with which a great interaction with the user is achieved, thus creating an important added value, usually takes three main forms: conference, workshop or course / seminar.

**- E-books:** As the name implies, an electronic book is a digital format file specially designed to be read and interpreted by electronic devices.

**- Blogs:** A blog is a website where content is published from time to time in the form of articles (also called posts) sorted by publication date, so the most recent article will appear first.
Podcast: is a periodic digital publication in audio or video that can be downloaded from the internet.

**- News:** The news is a discursive package issued by the media that intends to inform a specific audience about something that represents a novelty, that is important and that is current. The news differs precisely from what it is not because of the degree of affectation it has with society and with its temporal and spatial relationship.

**- Promote the adaptability of DCR in different communities of the creative economy in Mexico and LATAM
- Boost the economic development (micro-macro economic) of the new DCR communities in LATAM and the world.
- Research on: Cryptocurrencies in Community Development
- Research on: Cryptocurrencies in Sustainable Tourism
- Research on: “Creative Cities: The new partner communities. 
- Research and development on: “Decred Land; Blockchain Eco Smart Village, the first Coliving Crypto in Mexico.
- Proposal for a Work Plan 2020-2026 LATAM**

**Research and publication topics: **

In my research I touch very diverse and very deep topics, mainly of philosophy and circular economy, of colors (Rainbow) mainly in LATAM, such as the green, blue, orange, red and black economy, the new urban agenda, 17 Objectives of Sustainable developments, Art everywhere, creative cities, Sustainable Tourism, Permaculture, UNESCO, ONU HABITTAT, BigData, Smart Cities, Blockchain Cities, development of innovation and infrastructure, music, Festivals, Raves, Tic´s, cashless payments.
When relevant or necessary, in research I will link with DCR existing research to maximize the impact of community assets.
The writings will be published in Medium and will be shared on social networks through coordination with the Decred community.
The circular economy begins with the consideration of the current economic system, opposing what is known as taking, using and disposing of. It is a model that resembles cyclical behavior in nature and that aims to use resources through various eco-friendly strategies.

The so-called circular economy is shown as a paradigm shift where practices such as rent, repair, recycle, renew and reuse prevail. This is accompanied by measures that reduce production to the minimum levels allowed and, when it is necessary to use a product, take its elements that cannot be part of the environment for reuse.

The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has defined the "Green Economy" as one that results in an improvement of human well-being and social equity, while reducing environmental risks and ecological deficiencies. Gunter Pauli, Belgian entrepreneur and lecturer who has published several books was the one who coined the term in his book entitled “The blue economy: 10 years - 100 innovations - 100 million jobs” (The blue economy: 10 Years, 100 Innovations, 100 Million Jobs). There he describes a business model that aims to achieve abundance with what is at our fingertips, seeking a current economic revolution.

The "Orange Economy" consists of encompassing all income from the arts all those goods and services resulting from artistic and cultural activity, among their public policies have achieved growth not only in economic matters, but also in tourism and quality of life , which demonstrates the success of this concept and makes it a role model for other countries in the world that want to grow for and with its inhabitants.

The "Red Economy." It refers to consumerism as the center of economic growth. It leads individuals to consume without thinking about the consequences. Likewise, it is usually associated with the capitalist model and has principles of the blue economy.

Finally, the "Black Economy." It is interesting to note that in most informal jobs, cash moves, this is one of the reasons why it is difficult for the state to have control of them. However, these jobs generate money receipts that represent the livelihood of many families every day; Many employers do not show their reports to avoid labor legislation, or simply because they work on their own.
Collaborative Economy of Latin America Entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises play a fundamental role in the creation of shared value, as protagonists, but also as sources of information, leading the new trends of collective development through digital platforms, which cover different areas from finance, education, the environment, food, health or tourism, among others. As shown in the various examples detailed in the articles of this study, the Collaborative Economy - EC has the potential to generate numerous benefits in the region, reducing the environmental footprint, promoting access to new services and products and facilitating a more equitable distribution Of wealth. Likewise, the EC fosters positive social values ​​of exchange and collaboration through innovation and technology. With adequate regulation and supervision adapted to the new models of digital platforms, the CB can be a complement and a stimulus for sectors of the traditional economy, stimulating competition, expanding supply and promoting innovative alternatives for the consumer.

The **New Urban Agenda** is a guide to guide city development efforts for a wide range of actors (states, urban and regional leaders, donors, United Nations programs, academia, civil society, among others) to The next 20 years. The NAU seeks to promote more inclusive, compact and connected cities through urban planning and design, urban governance and legislation, and the urban economy. It seeks to create a reciprocal reinforcement link between urbanization and development.

The New Urban Agenda was approved at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) held in Quito, Ecuador, on October 20, 2016. The United Nations General Assembly endorsed the New Urban Agenda at its sixty-eighth plenary session of its seventy-first session, on December 23, 2016.

The United Nations Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat) promotes socially and environmentally sustainable peoples and cities. It is the focal point for all issues related to urbanization and human settlements in the United Nations system. UN-Habitat provides cities and other well-planned, well-governed and efficient human settlements, with adequate housing, infrastructure and universal access to employment and basic services such as water, energy and sanitation.

In 2015, the UN approved the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, an opportunity for countries and their societies to embark on a new path with which to improve the lives of all people, without leaving anyone behind. The Agenda has 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which include from the elimination of poverty to the fight against climate change, education, women's equality, the defense of the environment or the design of our cities.

**What are the SDGs?**
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the result of the agreement reached by the Member States of the United Nations and consist of a Declaration, 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 goals. The Member States through these 17 SDGs with their 169 goals and 231 indicators, the member states of the United Nations have firmly expressed that this agenda is universally and profoundly transformative. With this agenda, old paradigms are left behind where some countries donate while others receive conditioned help.

This agenda also seeks to express the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and build a true partnership for development where all countries participate.

The SDGs ... They are universal: The SDGs constitute a truly universal frame of reference and will apply to all countries. In the path of sustainable development, all countries have pending tasks and all face both common and individual challenges in achieving the multiple dimensions of sustainable development outlined in the SDGs.

They are transformative: As a program for "people, the planet, prosperity, peace and alliances", the 2030 Agenda offers a paradigm shift in relation to the traditional development model towards sustainable development that integrates the dimension Economic, social and environmental. The 2030 Agenda provides a transformative vision for sustainable development centered on people and the planet, based on human rights, and the dignity of people.

**They are civilizational:** The 2030 Agenda tries to ensure that no one is left behind and contemplates “a world of universal respect for equality and non-discrimination” between countries and within them, even with regard to equality, by confirming the responsibility of all States to “respect, protect and promote human rights, without distinction of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or any other another condition. ”

The SDGs are also a planning and monitoring tool for countries, both nationally and locally. Thanks to their long-term vision, they will be a support for each country in its path towards sustained, inclusive and harmonious development with the environment, through public policies and planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation instruments.

**Art and SDG?**
In order to promote the dissemination of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Information Center for Mexico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic (UNIC) participated in the project “The UN and Central de Muros hand in hand for a sustainable planet ”Where national and international artists painted 24 murals at the Central de Abasto in Mexico City with their interpretation of these objectives.

**Sustainable Cities**
Cities are hotbeds of ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, social development and much more. At best, cities have allowed people to progress socially and economically. In recent decades, the world has experienced unprecedented urban growth. In 2015, about 4000 million people lived in cities and that number is expected to increase to about 5000 million by 2030.

**Kreatopolis**
A decade ago, futurist Daniel Pink highlighted the passage from an industrial age to an age of knowledge, already advancing a next one, which he called the conceptual age. The latter would weigh creativity, design, capacity for synthesis and empathy as sources of wealth and economic development.

Today we confirm the arrival of that conceptual age with creativity playing a central role as an engine of development, which has resulted in a paradigm shift.

Creative goods and services emanating from talent, intellectual property and cultural heritage are relevant today not only as inputs for the entertainment industry, but also as sources for increasing productivity, attracting talent and the dynamism of cities.
Cultural exports worldwide have doubled in the last decade, reaching in 2013 the figure of 212.8 billion dollars, something like all exports from Argentina, Chile and Colombia together. Today, traditional commodities fluctuate uncertainly, but in Latin America and the Caribbean we have the great opportunity to continue investing in our talents to make creativity the most important commodity and thus be more competitive in international markets.

Latin America and the Caribbean has the challenge of fully inserting themselves in this race, because even though in the region there is 6.12% of total exports of goods worldwide, the regional cultural industry barely contributes 1.22% , which shows that even when talent exists, it still has enormous potential to develop.

The Kreatópolis are spaces that connect ideas and people, in which thousands of possibilities are combined and iterated, thanks to density and economies of scale, strengthening and widening the limits of the mind. Those are the orange shoots that we want to sow and those are the ecosystems that we must feed.

Reaching this idea is not a utopia. There are already cities in the region conceived as centers of innovation in which new companies, innovators and artists want to live and work. Buenos Aires with its Economic Districts, Recife with Porto Digital and Guadalajara with the Digital Creative City, are examples to follow.

We must adapt to this new paradigm by fostering a culture based on curiosity, innovation, entrepreneurship and respect for intellectual property in the early stages of education. We are already fully in the age of knowledge, and at least think about it, we will be in the next.

**UNESCO Creative Cities Network**
The Creative Cities Network was launched by UNESCO in 2004 to strengthen cooperation with and between cities that have identified creativity as a sustainable development strategy factor at an economic, social, cultural and environmental level.
By joining the Network, cities agree to share their good practices to develop partnerships to promote creativity and cultural industries, to strengthen participation in cultural life and integrate culture into urban development plans.

**Big data**
Big data is a term that describes the large volume of data - structured and unstructured - that flood a company every day. But it is not the amount of data that matters. What matters is what organizations do with the data. Big data can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business actions.
The importance of big data does not revolve around how much data you have, but what you do with them. You can take data from any source and analyze it to find answers that make it possible:

1) cost reductions
2) time reductions
3) development of new products and optimized solutions
4) intelligent decision making. When big data is combined with powerful analytics, business-related tasks can be performed, such as:

**Smart cities**
The cities of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are protagonists of one of the most significant population growth processes that the planet has experienced, with great consequences for the sustainability, quality of life and competitiveness of the region. Addressing these challenges is an evolution in the field of governance and decision-making, as well as the increasingly efficient use of our cities' resources, with a view to undertaking intelligent management.
From its increasingly wide use, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have become a fundamental ally of this intelligent management in LAC. However, the use of these technologies should be understood as a means and not as an end in itself. In the words of Enrique V. Iglesias, former President of the Inter-American Development Bank (1988-2005): “It is not enough to have smart cities. It is also necessary to have intelligent citizens ”.

**Blockchain**
Blockchain was born because of the need to eliminate intermediaries such as banks, in the case of financial operations. These institutions are necessary to be able to make valuable transactions, because they are responsible for certifying that we are who we say we are. In exchange for providing this service, banks or electronic platforms such as PayPal keep user data and trade with them. This restricts privacy and thereby freedom.

**A cryptocurrency**, or cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure transactions, control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are a type of alternative currency and digital currency. There is controversy that cryptocurrencies have to be decentralized control or centralized currencies by central banks or another entity.
The control of each currency works through a decentralized database, usually a blockchain, which serves as a public financial transaction database.

The first cryptocurrency that started operating was bitcoin in 2009 and, since then, many others have appeared with different features and protocols such as Dash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Dogecoin, Decred.

**Blockchain Cities** 
While most of the first “Smart Cities” initiatives were driven by global ICT companies and top-down political leadership. In recent years, major cities are beginning to adopt the joint creation of citizens. At the same time, blockchain technologies are emerging as a disruptive and transformative force in almost every industry.

Blockchain technologies have significant potential for smart cities to achieve their efficiency and transparency goals while allowing smart cities to reinforce the goals of joint citizen creation. Dubai has established itself as a pioneer in this space, having set the goal of being the world's first blockchain-driven city by 2020, with 20 blockchain projects already online. New York City recently announced plans to follow the example of Dubai. The Blockchain Cities Alliance (BCA) was established to help connect the smart cities movement with the disruptive and decentralizing power of blockchain technology.
Decred.org 

Since 2016, Decred has striven to solve blockchain governance. Our innovative consensus voting model empowers stakeholders and allows for the seamless transition from one set of rules to another. Decentralized decision-making and self-funding have enabled us to build a robust, evolving digital currency, free from third party influence.

Our modular codebase offers unique adaptability and can scale to the latest blockchain technology. Decred’s technology enabled the world’s first successful direct on-chain user-activated consensus vote. This represents a revolutionary approach to stakeholder governance where our community directs the project and makes decisions together.

We are community-powered. Stakeholders who participate in Decred’s decision-making are rewarded for their efforts. Sustainable funding and a resilient contractor model allow for anyone to join Decred at any time and engage in its governance. Decred’s value is in the people who work on it - together we’re building the decentralized future we want to see.

Decred is built to last. Our development activity and quality are among the highest in the space. Features of the Decred software include:

- An innovative hybrid proof-of-work (PoW) proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus voting system
- A censorship-resistant blockchain-anchored public proposal platform
- Smart contracts that work such as Lightning Network
- Cross-chain atomic swaps between different digital currencies
- Cross-platform wallets for ease of use
- Part of the reward from new blocks goes towards the development of Decred to ensure that it will continually evolve to meet the needs and wants of the community now and in the years to come. These are just some of the features planned for 2018 and early 
2019:
- Lightning network
- Initial privacy release
- Decentralized control of funds
- Decentralized autonomous organizations
- Scalability optimizations
- Decrediton integrations
- Marketing growth
- Proposal for a Decentralized Exchange


Decred can benefit from transmitting its own ideology to new users as an advance in human, artistic and decentralized progress, through the active participation of various parts of the world and the artistic universe, through the development of cultural projects, encouraging groups to unify efforts and to be able to promote the different communities in cities around LATAM and the world.

The **#Anthropocene **is not, therefore, a uniform era.

We went through the so-called “4th industrial revolution” and it seems a distant past: in 1820, only 12% of people could read. In 2018, the figure increased to 83%. In 1800, only 43% of children reached five years of age, today they are 96%. And the world has moved quickly to meet material needs, in 1820 94 out of 100 people lived in conditions of extreme poverty (estimated at $ 1.9 dollars / day) and in 2015 that figure was 10 out of 100.

Socially, populist parties have more than tripled their support in Europe in the last 20 years. Populist leaders are spreading messages of hate and confrontation. In Asia, "algorithmic governance," as Martin Chorzempa says, is already on the move with hundreds of millions of surveillance cameras to control its most populous country.

In contrast, in the corporate world, several companies launch “green” advertising with a purpose, cultivating new mantras that mix late capitalism with a new awareness of the planet: triple end result; change management; zero marginal cost; circular economy; theory or full attention clean capitalism; ...

Do these new mantras mean a growing concern for planetary values? Are they marketing maneuvers? Or ways to improve productivity in societies that continue to be governed by the ideology of growth?

The #Anthropocene not only leaves an indelible mark on the blue planet, but it is also modifying the human being: the outbreak of artificial intelligence, dataism or biotechnology.

We have stopped valuing privacy and are happy with the easy positive reinforcement (like, disgust, sharing, friend, not friend, emojis) of others in the face of the moments of our lives. The deregulated environments of the principles of good coexistence, since some social networks are a pipe for hate speech and intimidation.

Social platforms can separate us and unite us. In this volatile ocean there are causes that are being mobilized: #ExtinctionRebellion; #BlackLivesMatter; #Occupy; #TahrirSquare; #UmbrellaRevolution; (CORONA VIRUS?) # YouthForClimate ... In parallel, the #ReclaimSocial movement points to a positive online coexistence in the context of frequent curious judgments.
We talk about superhumans, the transfer of consciousness to computers or machines smarter than us. On the other hand, there has never been so much scientific evidence about the benefits of human contact with nature, or the practices of yoga, sports, meditation, wellness, ikigai, hygge.

Our ability to save the planet coincides with the power we have to destroy it.

Human action cannot be destined to fatalism and we all face facts about the destruction of ecosystems.
It is no secret that many species are at risk. From another perspective, the giant panda is no longer in danger.

**"There is no Plan B, or better, Planet B. We have to live on this planet and save it."**

The statement is from scientist Martin Rees. Also in the middle of the scientific community, in February 2000, Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer declared that we live in a new geological era, the Anthropocene.

By containing the prefix anthropos, which means "human being", the term defines a period marked by human action with a profound effect on the environment.

The Earth has existed for approximately 4.5 billion years, this historical moment being unique because our species, homo sapiens, is aware that it can change the planet.

We are so numerous that we can strip ourselves to the point of becoming a sterile world for future generations. In contrast, knowledge and technology can eventually help us reverse the situation.

Everything depends on us. Everyone, today, here, now.

The ability to be visionaries is the trigger. The solution may be in the innate faculty of any human being: imagination for the innovation. 

The visionary epithet is to imagine future scenarios and make them a reality. It applies to people, groups, organizations, communities, cities, countries, festivals that, despite the seemingly desperate situation, still manage to do something, find answers, imagine solutions, think creatively, generate ideas to combat apathy: alternative ways of impact.

The capacity of the Earth comes from our lifestyles and will never be sustainable if 9800 million people consume as much energy, water, meat, fish or other resources as in industrialized countries. 50 years ago, the planetary population was 3500 billion. Today there are 7600 billion and the forecasts point to 9800 billion in 2050. Urban pressure will increase, in 2030 cities such as Lagos (Nigeria) or São Paulo (in Brazil) will have populations over 30 million. By 2050, 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities.

How to feed both homo sapiens and animals (often raised in deplorable conditions) that you consume?
To produce a kilo of cereal, we need one to three tons of water; A kilo of meat needs fifteen tons. Between 2010 and 2050, the environmental effects of the food system can increase by 50-90 percent.

Conventional agriculture, which is the world's largest user of water (70 percent), proposes to increase production. This intensification will bring more herbicides and chemical fertilizers that will kill soil microorganisms that are the basis of life on Earth.
There is scientific evidence that suggests that the organic production method can meet the needs of a growing population, which can provide conscious approaches to deal with nature and animal life in an anachronistic sense with conventional agriculture.

**Chronology:**
A series of publications (from 3 to 6 writings, backed with a presence on social networks) during the next 10 months (March-December).

**Cost:**

$ 3k in arrears for the first publication and fundamental research.
$ 12k for 10 months of future research and publications.
The invoice will be billed monthly through the contractor's management system.

Total: $ 15,000 USD IN DCR

ALL THIS RESEARCH is used to develop a work plan and be able to work actively in the following cities of Mexico and LATAM, through the activations that research allows us to work for the next 5 years.

**Risks and mitigators:**
I am not a developer, but I am a communicator, with extensive experience in various global issues and I need field research and create the possibilities of developing new communities of DCR ambassadors in new "unexplored" communities.
This will be achieved by validating the documents with known members of the community prior to publication. This could also edit the content for maximum impact.

A difference from a software delivery that can be measured by specifications, this proposal implies qualitative and quantitative research. As you explored these issues, your themes can be expanded or modified, for adaptation in the new diverse DCR communities around the world.

I believe that this adaptability will turn out to be a positive net result for the projects that are found to be resulting
.This is my first proposal, I based on several that I saw in POLITEIA and I am very happy to be part of this community, and I hope to contribute in all possible aspects, I hope to receive your comments, questions, ideas, suggestions and reflections.
With much love, for humanity, for a better world for all, de la banda pa la banda lml, Oscar Gamboa.
