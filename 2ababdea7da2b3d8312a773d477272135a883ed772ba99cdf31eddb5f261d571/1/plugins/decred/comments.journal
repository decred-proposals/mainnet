Politeia cannot force any established contributors to begin the work outlined.\n\nIf this proposal is approved as it currently stands, and Trust Wallet moves forward with doing their part, but nobody steps up to do the \"Decred Project\" part, there is a strong argument to be made that the treasury is liable to pay Trust Wallet for their work, even though it will be useless until the \"Decred Project\" assignments are completed (and there is no guarantee that they ever will be).\n\nI would request that oregonisaac refrains from opening this proposal for voting until we have DCC-holding contractors pledged to do the work outlined here, at the rates budgeted, and that fact is reflected in an edit of this proposal.

It is posted directly to Politeia, so that the drafting process and comments can be captured and archived on Politeia instead of other platforms that might loose them in future. Read reasoning [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/117). I appreciate this if it is the cause.\n\nI agree that eventually proposal should be updated with decred team that will work on this.\n\nThis seems a good integration for the blockbook part as it allows easier integration into future trezor products. \n\nAlthough i am not sure about the trustwallet part of integration. Concerns being\n\n- Its a ETH and dapps focused product, now acquired by Binance, not sure what kind of influence ETH devs/team and Binance have on the listing on wallet and exchange.\n\n- As with every integration, what are delisting rules?\n\n- Does support for so many coins/chains leads to bloated code and thus bugs? Can we have some kind of code audit report for security?\n\n- Is wallet app going to be integrated with Binance exchange in some way? If yes this will be good for binance traders but will open up new attack vector imo.\n\nI think the cost of integration and work required seems reasonable. Is the $50/month hosting cost is for one instance of Blockbook? Should we not have multiple geographically distributed instances to ensure smooth availability. I am not sure what monthly development entails at $50/month, can you calrify that?","signature":"2e1773e029bb6ff99a29262af5a1badfdbc31c57003f4dc0013e8b31b1030ebdc87bbe631de1fb8dc1dc5285eecf50e0d56412c8c5a826499c413592e09a0d0b","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"5","receipt":"4e372736dc56a499e7e935541abdddc60abc9554999b2a19a510078b0014dea15340fdc06a27eb54f6ace85e3922333b3b62507742833f4552b4d45106d49f00","timestamp":1551901769,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Assuming there are contributors interested and qualified to do the work that we can sign up for this project we can do a deeper dive with them to shore up the estimated costs and extending hosting/maintenance fees.\nThe guess on development work is that there would be an irregular need to push a change downstream when blockbook makes major changes, so it might be 0 hours for months, but then 2-3 hours for a major release change to ensure compatibility in testnet before allowing the change.","signature":"1068b7773498866db19561fdf0fbb4573993132b80b5b7b088e51c670c386cf88232c8a6984f1332427e6a73b0894991abd0cc498d4d64a0ae75e21e1a30910f","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"6","receipt":"5307e63e1572791c07d6b2ac0ce45936aa6cae49be06e768ec10a7de446ac4e9d2f1f0a60e2dc76c5103f8aa61f9ba6facbe3fa3d7962d4100376836b6f89004","timestamp":1551939108,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
