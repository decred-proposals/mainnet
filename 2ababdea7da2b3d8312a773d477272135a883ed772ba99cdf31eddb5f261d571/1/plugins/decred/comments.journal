It is posted directly to Politeia, so that the drafting process and comments can be captured and archived on Politeia instead of other platforms that might loose them in future. Read reasoning [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/117). I appreciate this if it is the cause.\n\nI agree that eventually proposal should be updated with decred team that will work on this.\n\nThis seems a good integration for the blockbook part as it allows easier integration into future trezor products. \n\nAlthough i am not sure about the trustwallet part of integration. Concerns being\n\n- Its a ETH and dapps focused product, now acquired by Binance, not sure what kind of influence ETH devs/team and Binance have on the listing on wallet and exchange.\n\n- As with every integration, what are delisting rules?\n\n- Does support for so many coins/chains leads to bloated code and thus bugs? Can we have some kind of code audit report for security?\n\n- Is wallet app going to be integrated with Binance exchange in some way? If yes this will be good for binance traders but will open up new attack vector imo.\n\nI think the cost of integration and work required seems reasonable. Is the $50/month hosting cost is for one instance of Blockbook? Should we not have multiple geographically distributed instances to ensure smooth availability. I am not sure what monthly development entails at $50/month, can you calrify that?","signature":"2e1773e029bb6ff99a29262af5a1badfdbc31c57003f4dc0013e8b31b1030ebdc87bbe631de1fb8dc1dc5285eecf50e0d56412c8c5a826499c413592e09a0d0b","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"5","receipt":"4e372736dc56a499e7e935541abdddc60abc9554999b2a19a510078b0014dea15340fdc06a27eb54f6ace85e3922333b3b62507742833f4552b4d45106d49f00","timestamp":1551901769,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
