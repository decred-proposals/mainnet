Politeia cannot force any established contributors to begin the work outlined.\n\nIf this proposal is approved as it currently stands, and Trust Wallet moves forward with doing their part, but nobody steps up to do the \"Decred Project\" part, there is a strong argument to be made that the treasury is liable to pay Trust Wallet for their work, even though it will be useless until the \"Decred Project\" assignments are completed (and there is no guarantee that they ever will be).\n\nI would request that oregonisaac refrains from opening this proposal for voting until we have DCC-holding contractors pledged to do the work outlined here, at the rates budgeted, and that fact is reflected in an edit of this proposal. If this proposal goes up for vote as it currently stands, I will be voting against it, not necessarily because I'm opposed to the proposal itself, but on the basis of the point of order raised above.","signature":"96507770cbc02939f51f51180bb610c39af18f90d0da6bb19b6c027b4d5f955f95412e7a79227f8c34e31b6e8db3128c70dc2fed93bde4fd878640f7bff60305","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"1","receipt":"1afd2c3e5a5e7a437ef2fafa1a0c0b43b6db4127d2d3eb97f7aa32c211a00843f88523dc4f8251734aac01bafa6a2b70cef3799687907c4d32c801e32935b206","timestamp":1551799226,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
