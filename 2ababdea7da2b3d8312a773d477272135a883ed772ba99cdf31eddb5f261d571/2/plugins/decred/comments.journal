It is posted directly to Politeia, so that the drafting process and comments can be captured and archived on Politeia instead of other platforms that might loose them in future. Read reasoning [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/117). I appreciate this if it is the cause.\n\nI agree that eventually proposal should be updated with decred team that will work on this.\n\nThis seems a good integration for the blockbook part as it allows easier integration into future trezor products. \n\nAlthough i am not sure about the trustwallet part of integration. Concerns being\n\n- Its a ETH and dapps focused product, now acquired by Binance, not sure what kind of influence ETH devs/team and Binance have on the listing on wallet and exchange.\n\n- As with every integration, what are delisting rules?\n\n- Does support for so many coins/chains leads to bloated code and thus bugs? Can we have some kind of code audit report for security?\n\n- Is wallet app going to be integrated with Binance exchange in some way? If yes this will be good for binance traders but will open up new attack vector imo.\n\nI think the cost of integration and work required seems reasonable. Is the $50/month hosting cost is for one instance of Blockbook? Should we not have multiple geographically distributed instances to ensure smooth availability. I am not sure what monthly development entails at $50/month, can you calrify that?","signature":"2e1773e029bb6ff99a29262af5a1badfdbc31c57003f4dc0013e8b31b1030ebdc87bbe631de1fb8dc1dc5285eecf50e0d56412c8c5a826499c413592e09a0d0b","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"5","receipt":"4e372736dc56a499e7e935541abdddc60abc9554999b2a19a510078b0014dea15340fdc06a27eb54f6ace85e3922333b3b62507742833f4552b4d45106d49f00","timestamp":1551901769,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Do remember very well when the exorbitant early sign-up fees were a big issue. Even though the rough consensus back in the day was not to pay for any (and this being a well principled decision as Pi wasn't released yet) worth to notice there was still a big and well reasoned push by various community members, traders, etc to even pay for example for Binance integration from their own pockets. Reason being as that would have likely meant a significant liquidity boost for the project at the time. Now the cost here isn’t a fee for sign-up but for funding for the development man hours. To me this seems reasonable and something exactly the dev treasury should be used for.\n\nI rate proposals as this by whether it adds any value to the Decred ecosystem. Getting implemented into a number of different wallets (which are of decent quality) is by all means a good thing and grows decentralization. It’s also one of those small steps that adds up towards maturing the project in a longer run, which is needed before wider adoption.","signature":"500dfaba073feb62ca3b048b55fd0a1ff38819e042fa3b2d54957d1b0ec95457e0d38c5f3c673d087034673bcd41c1ee8356380ac7d3acdc7b092aeae7c7a30f","publickey":"1602347ec404e3209b65b29240e9146eba135a99ce3d5f73f8ee5a9115bc534a","commentid":"11","receipt":"7e33d778cba021316de1d21ac27cc17cd8a227920dd7b86bd1453072c1a8913bc6c33c5d75788ca8e2c542b8b7bb4bde2f2b3c9fe2d9781961f9e948cdaabd03","timestamp":1552615766,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If we talk about any developer switching from current work and paying maintenance from Treasury I'd like to know how popular is this wallet.\n\nDid [all other coins](https://github.com/TrustWallet/wallet-core) pay for integration and hosting their Blockbook instances?\n\nWhy didn't Trust Wallet team submit a proposal themselves?\n\n\u003e To facilitate balance lookup, searches, and other functionality without relying on a 3rd party server, Trust Wallet utilizes Blockbook, the back-end service for Trezor wallet.\n\nThis reads like to be autonomous, one needs to run the Decred full node _and_ Blockbook indexer, which is similar to self-hosting Decred full node and dcrdata today.\n\n\u003e The Blockbook development required for Trust Wallet will also allow for additional integrations with existing Trezor technology \n\nWhat kind of \"additional integrations\" this makes possible? This is strategic question - what Decred gains from Blockbook integration if Trust Wallet turns out unpopular?\n\nHow does current Trezor integration work if Blockbook still doesn't support Decred?\n\nBlockbook is Trezor's \"territory\" so to speak, isn't it their job to code it?\n\n\u003e 2. Add backend/node support for Decred to Blockbook following the Blockbook contribution guide (to be completed and hosted by the Decred Project team).\n\nI assume this means that Decred support is integrated into main/upstream Blockbook, not someone's fork.\n\nWhy does Decred need to host an indexer for wallet users? This is replacing one 3rd party watching users' requests (e.g. Trust Wallet team or whoever runs \"default\" Blockbook servers) with another (Decred team). This doesn't fundamentally improve the privacy of Trust Wallet DCR users, unless they host Blockbook server themselves. If the majority of users are expected to not run their Blockbooks and rely on 3rd party middleman server, this is an investment into another Electrum-like infrastructure that Decred used to avoid and went straight to SPV \"done right\". _(please correct if my reasoning is wrong)_\n\nIf Trust Wallet implemented Decred's SPV protocol it would look much better to me.\n\n\u003e Ongoing Development | Per Month | Decred Project | 50 USD\n\nIn case the Ongoing development requires more than 50 USD a month else the wallet is unusable for Decred, who will pay for that? If Blockbook devs decide to do a huge refactoring of the codebase, who will pay for updating and testing Decred part?","signature":"8d8327273fc4baf652ce231b94a41b27b05a529a08fd92bdc6a4ac73bc712dc1241a78c97a3aa2369aa098665bb82c2182833f4aac96e9a47a0f0f926f8b7603","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"17","receipt":"5b94920431767fa185637eb1b4592432cae0c112734e6daf3c28326100b6d50ab04d4896b57bf99ba0e28f9e71c6f4d48283aac7d7f2c6d38e824fd7836d9704","timestamp":1553419400,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Did all other coins pay for integration and hosting their Blockbook instances?\n\nThere is no integration payment.  These are hard costs for development and hosting fees.\n\nI don't know if all other coins have paid, the one project I was able to talk to in detail about the process did and also paid their own developers for the work that was required.\n\n2. Why didn't Trust Wallet team submit a proposal themselves?\n\nThey aren't receiving the funding, there is no \"fee\", part of it is going to an independent developer in their community and part to a developer in our community(to be determined).\n\n3. All the Blockbook questions:\n\nI can't really address the \"what if\" questions easily or the \"what will\" questions.  Many other projects have worked to integrate into Blockbook, here is the list:\n[Blockbook list of coins/ports](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/blob/master/docs/ports.md)\n\nThe Trust Wallet team has already started their work in good faith and is a very popular project.  At worst if they are not popular this integration brings us a step closer to native wallet integration with Trezor.\n\n4. If Trust Wallet implemented Decred's SPV protocol it would look much better to me.\n\nWe can't expect other projects to change how they do things to support our project, maybe if we were a top 5 project, but I think we need to be pragmatic about cooperation/integration if we want to be successful. Also although I don't believe enough testing/verification has been done all the wallet makers I have spoken too are unwilling to risk performance issues supporting project specific SPV/node implementations.\n\n5. In case the Ongoing development requires more than 50 USD a month else the wallet is unusable for Decred, who will pay for that? If Blockbook devs decide to do a huge refactoring of the codebase, who will pay for updating and testing Decred part?\n\nWe would need to have another proposal if that were to occur to request funding beyond what is scoped in the proposal, or perhaps we will make inroads with Blockbook development through this cooperation (they have a fantastic team/product) who would be helpful in that event.\n\nApologies for the slow response to these great questions, was traveling and do not travel with credentials.","signature":"5fc9c4898cdf730c27f3399afb7481b6aa84cd4bea45db59c86b7d44d80a8bc9c8289a360fdf36958645c190a2e8860b4ae5da5fa84d95ea4721f11b9b5f6308","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"19","receipt":"289ed91b44904f3f06fae4a197154f5ed7bd8e6714e3a6ddfc2dba322fdb566847b929ae9e1fb17c8b938f7d1bc35349cebce9a4b0728b2eae3560b5ea0b9a04","timestamp":1553892708,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Beyond that, facilitating easier integration into Trezor hardware wallets will also allow early adopters ease of access with a comforting level of security.
