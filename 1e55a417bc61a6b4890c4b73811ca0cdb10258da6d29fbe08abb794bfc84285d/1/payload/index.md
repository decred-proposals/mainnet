Video Content Production for Decred Phase 2

## What?

The purpose of this proposal is to continue a budget for work involving the creation and administration of video content as well as general video editing support for the Decred project over the next 6 months.

## Why?

Video content is arguably the most popular form of media today. Having a presence on platforms like YouTube, Bitchute, and even Twitter is paramount to promoting the project and helping spread awareness and educating new users. Utilizing YouTube is a powerful way to show off the project's updates, progress, and get new eyes on the Decred ecosystem.


## What Kind Of Work Is Involved in This Proposal?

- Bi-Weekly News Updates displaying general news and progress that the project is making.
- Explainer and “How To” videos. I look forward to creating videos on how to use LN, the DEX, Privacy, etc
- General Decred Videos
- Smaller form Videos for the likes of Twitter.
- Video editing support for any community members that may request it. (Example: DCR Australia, Checkmate's Research, etc)
- Video material for Events (Example: Consensus 2020 Presentation)
- Broader Crypto-Currency Videos (with a Pro-DCR angle) similar to what the [DCR Brasil team accomplished on their YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA4AMvrfa70) in order to attract a wider audience.

Videos are uploaded to Decred's [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2bYDaPYHpSmJPh_M5dNSg?view_as=subscriber) & [Bitchute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/WvRUu3MFHuB8/) Channel.

## Who?

[Exitus](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777). I have been a Decred advocate and Stakeholder for over 3 years. Please check the [Decred YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2bYDaPYHpSmJPh_M5dNSg) to see content from Phase 1 that I created.

[Checkmate](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_). I recruited Checkmate for Phase 2 to assist me with writing some of the broader non-Decred specific scripts. He will also serve as someone I can bounce ideas off of, and provide feedback on an on-going basis.

## Metrics from Phase 1

Metrics are an important way to gauge what works and what doesn’t work. While we have to trust 3rd party platforms for these gameable analytics, I believe the metrics provided by YouTube are for the most part accurate.

| YouTube Metric| Value Over Last 6 Months |
|-------------|---------|
| Views       | 21,402  |
| Like %      | 98.9%   |
| Subs Gained | 478     |
| Subs Lost   | 255     |
| Comments    | 170     |

| Traffic Source   |   % Over Last 6 Months    |
|------------------|-------|
| YouTube Search   | 28.2% |
| External         | 20.5% |
| Browse Features  | 19.3% |
| Suggested Videos | 10.3% |
| Channel Pages    | 9.2%  |
| Others           | 12.5% |

Most popular video: [DCR 101 - How to Stake Decred 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5lcm6yttEk): 1,587 Views

Bitchute View Count: 1,531 (Channel started April 14th)

Views on various videos uploaded to Twitter: ~18,500 

## Thoughts

I would like to see these metric numbers much higher, however, I feel that this overlaps with wider discussion surrounding how to facilitate marketing and bring more awareness to the project. More general awareness of Decred will naturally see more hits and subs on the Decred YouTube Channel.

With the absence of Marketing Lead Dustorf and thus the suspension of most of the funds for [The United States Marketing Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5) (Marketing for the English speaking world) external marketing efforts to bring new users to our platforms has been somewhat minimal over the past 6 months. I am convinced that with more unique, community-focused marketing efforts we can boost numbers for content produced across all mediums, not just videos.

Throughout Phase 1 I received lots of positive feedback which I was happy to see. I look forward to creating more videos for the Decred community, especially content to support the 1.6.0 release should this proposal pass. If anyone has any thoughts, ideas, or would like to work with me, please feel free to message me on Matrix/Twitter.

*Note*: I had planned for more videos during Phase 1 in hopes that 1.6.0 would be released during Phase 1. I’d prefer to create videos for that release once those features are thoroughly polished and live so the videos will be more tangible to viewers and not just “ Feature X, Y, and Z is Coming Soon™”.

## Budget & Duration:

**Maximum cap of $2,700/Month** payable in Decred and invoiced via the Contractor Management System. 

Starting immediately and ending in 6 months' time.
