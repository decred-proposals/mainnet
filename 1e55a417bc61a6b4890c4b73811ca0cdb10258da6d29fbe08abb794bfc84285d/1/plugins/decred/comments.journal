The way content is presented is also bad. Therefore, low views.\nI won't vote for this kind of content at that price.\nHere are my wishes:\n- stop retelling what everyone has already read;\n- make weekly broadcasts with guests from developers, investors and representatives of other projects (like Decred);\n- take yourself out of the frame, hire a pretty girl, dress her up in a Harley Quinn costume, and let her be the main one.\nThen your views will skyrocket and Decred will get coverage.
