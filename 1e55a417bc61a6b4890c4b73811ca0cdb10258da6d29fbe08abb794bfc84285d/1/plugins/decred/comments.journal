Obviously Politeia doesn't work like that, and you can't call on people not listed in the proposal to do things. However, with enthusiasm building around one of Decred's biggest releases to date (1.6.0), I can only hope the community will assist in promoting any created content.\n\nAs I wrote in the proposal, this overlaps with wider marketing efforts to break out of our Decred community bubble. I am excited and supportive of the on-going talks and new ideas creative community members are generating. \n\n\u003e  I would very much like to see boosting this content, eg. on Twitter through \"RT, comment \u0026 tag friend to get $30 in DCR\" strategy, but it's not my call.\n\nI would be open to doing this using my own funds gained from this proposal if the community supports it. I understand some may see it as a cheap way to gain views, but I think it is an exciting way to draw in new viewers.","signature":"bde69c3c531c6a4bd5f6cc24480acc499dcb4420948c1593c419ae594fbcd1dd5c180caaeb5261d3f4787e6c4a47dc44894679cf8c6ffeb04deae4ffedfb6502","publickey":"1d3a6202cf928d4c53ea9a4cc3df59f819d2ffc6a2d703bdd6ea001a7bc460f3","commentid":"11","receipt":"dfc4c5e2060ffe956e53a06a4d9614bf6b6485565cb68d8e35a58aa440f8c32b852e21dce15c6fd0e46ced62972e16511bb9117f28ffcde087d041b23194bd0a","timestamp":1599333893,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Furthermore, having news \u0026 updates on a platform like YouTube opens it up to a broader audience.\n\n\u003e  make weekly broadcasts with guests from developers, investors and representatives of other projects (like Decred);\n\nI believe funds for this were authorized in the United States Marketing Proposal under the Decred Assembly. If the community \u0026 devs would like to start that back up I would be happy to partake.\n\n\u003e  take yourself out of the frame, hire a pretty girl, dress her up in a Harley Quinn costume, and let her be the main one. Then your views will skyrocket and Decred will get coverage. Stop being a dinosaur.\n\nWhile this comment is trollish in nature, the truth is having an attractive woman in videos would undoubtedly boost views as our audience is 99.9% men (Per YouTube analytics). If the community feels we should hire such talent I'm all for it. \n\n\u003e  Therefore, low views. \n\nViews are low because general awareness is low. Very few people are searching for Decred on YouTube. \n\nPer YouTube, my videos on Staking, Decred Node Setup, and working for the DAO are all the #1 result someone searches for those things. The question is how do we get people looking into this stuff more.","signature":"836a45b1712676cae95265d369058a804642a052ab4cae6b42650132972c4d0d5881992965d5bf3706c22d29da06eb4a85a02b6a1b403908feab0ce3d776380c","publickey":"1d3a6202cf928d4c53ea9a4cc3df59f819d2ffc6a2d703bdd6ea001a7bc460f3","commentid":"12","receipt":"173e2947188e03fcb6938684eb17718be78d1e110f098bca15cb6a71b2eb5369f43c8f810a1f253e359fffb15eb14ff7e0449cdd7572c8862a98bf18e9001f0b","timestamp":1599334880,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Exitus has shown excellent quality video output and to be honest has made possible many ad-hoc video productions. The educational series is very important and I strongly encourage more of these.
