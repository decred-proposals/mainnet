**Date:** February 12, 2019

**Client’s Name:** Decred

**Project Name:** Decred Blockchain Wallet Tutorial Campaign

**Representatives For Each Cryptocurrency Project:** Politeia For Decred Community

**Representatives For www.Cryptocurrency.Market:**
Denni Lovejoy, Software Tutorial Specialist, https://twitter.com/DenniLovejoy


**I. Summary**

Currently there are over 2,000 cryptocurrency projects listed on coinmarketcap.com. Many of these cryptocurrency projects have their own official “decentralized wallets”, use recommended third-party wallets or are in the process of developing their wallet software.

For example, the Decred project created the Decrediton Wallet.

Many newcomers entering the crypto market will not be computer or software savvy and will not properly set up, protect, and secure their cryptocurrency wallets. Crypto projects such as Decred will need Blockchain Tutorials for the Decrediton Wallet to help new users understand how to use the wallet correctly.

The goal of this proposal is to obtain funding to create:

Create a set of Decred tutorials to help educate the public on how to use the the Decrediton wallet and Politeia account in a step by step user friendly way. 

This set of tutorials will include:
- How to download and install the Decrediton wallet
- How to send and receive Decred using Decrediton
- How to back up, protect and update Decrediton
- How to make a Stakepool account and stake
- How to make a Politeia account, upvote/downvote and comment
- How to make a Politeia Proposal

**II. Introduction**

My name is Denni Lovejoy, I am a Blockchain Tutorial Specialist at https://www.Cryptocurrency.Market and you can view the quality of my past blockchain tutorials here:

**Blockchain Tutorial #19 - How To Setup A Decred Wallet** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rWLI_pC0d4

I started creating blockchain tutorials to help newbies avoid getting hacked by bad actors in the crypto community. I chose to work with Tai Zen & Leon Fu Dot Com’s www.Cryptocurrency.Market channel because they were the 1st and only channel on the internet back in early 2013 that I found to be talking about trading and investing in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. For example, they were the only channel that I know of to recommend investing in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Stratis, Monero, Decred, NXT, Antshares, etc. when everyone else was afraid to do so. These coins all turned out to be huge winners.

I learned from the www.Cryptocurrency.Market channel that the #1 most important thing in cryptocurrencies is to survive. Unfortunately, many people who have bought cryptocurrencies lost them because of a lack of security, privacy and formal education on how to use their digital wallets correctly. The lack of blockchain tutorials amongst all cryptocurrencies is why I started my Blockchain Tutorial playlist on the Cryptocurrency Market channel. I believe uneducated newbies in the crypto community who do not understand what it takes to secure, protect and use their digital wallets will mistakenly leave their crypto on exchanges which is subject to being hacked or stolen and will not back up their private keys.

I have been monitoring the digital wallet space for quite some time now and I have chosen to associate my brand/ reputation & seek funding from the Decred community for due to the project’s a) professionalism b) software engineering/technical abilities and most importantly c) a working governance model and lastly d) the Decred team has a working decentralized wallet called Decrediton which is located on https://www.decred.org/downloads/.

For the above reasons and the fact that I am more comfortable working with people I have personally met in person, I RESPECTFULLY submit this formal proposal to the Decred community to request funding for myself to create an ambitious, 3rd party, independent, unbiased blockchain tutorials and online advertising campaign to educate the public on how to use the Decred wallet and Politeia account correctly.

**III. Objectives**

To create a series of tutorial videos to:

- Educate the public on how to setup and use the Decrediton wallet with a set of user friendly Blockchain Tutorials.

- I respectfully request $750 worth of Decred for me to complete the section IV. “Blockchain Tutorial” Deliverables.

- The grand total cost of section IV. “Blockchain Tutorial” Deliverables = $750.

- Payment will be paid to me in Decred (DCR) by a Decred Representative and will be processed after all 3 tutorials are accepted by the Decred community. I will email a Decred Representative an invoice with the details.

- I will include 1 revision per video.

**VI. Conditions**

- The tutorials will be hosted on the Decred YouTube channel or any other official platform and not hosted anywhere else.

I shared the first draft of my proposal on Reddit and Slack to invite feedback and commentary from the Decred community which you can view here: https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/anksg2/proposed_statement_of_work_sow_for_decred/. 

**VII. Statement Of Work (SOW) FAQ's:**

*The following questions are for Decred to consider and are not part of the SOW.*

**What is Denni Lovejoy’s big picture approach to help educate and promote Decred to the public?**


- This entire SOW is based on the premise that Decred is sponsoring me to do a series of educational/ tutorial style videos of the cryptocurrency governance coin sector.

**Why are you taking a tutorial-based style approach to the videos?**

- The reason for this approach is to help viewers AVOID any mistakes they may make while going through ANY of the processes associated with using Decred software.

**Will you follow the Decred design guidelines and have consistent screen-design intro/ outros?**

- Yes, I plan to use consistent screen-design and leverage anything additional the Decred design and support team can offer me including intro, outros, disclaimers, ideas, etc. I will be following the guidelines found on https://decred.org/brand/.

**Do you plan to publish the videos on the Youtube channel of your company or will they go into the official Decred Youtube channel?**

- No, I do not plan to publish the videos on our 'Cryptocurrency Market' YouTube channel which has over 26,000 subscribers and over 700 videos. Decred will have all the rights to the videos and will not be hosted elsewhere.

**What is your target reach expectations and how do you want to keep the videos up-to-date if something changes in the GUI/software?**

- I do not plan on doing any advertising or marketing for the tutorials and will let the Decred PR marketing team strategize that. I can consult with the PR team as needed, but my proposal is to create video content only suggested by the community. I will give 1 revision per video if any of the videos need updating.

**Did the other cryptocurrency projects you made video tutorials for also pay for their production?**

- No. My approach has been to create 66 blockchain tutorials for free first, to then leverage this work portfolio as my Proof-Of-Skill so that I can approach projects like Decred with my proposal.

**After watching your videos on youtube the production does not feel in step with our current educational videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMrpvQ0yJ_xFLGwNoDzfT6Wr0XHpyr1R.**

- I can adapt to the current style of educational videos listed in the EDU.DCR playlist. The main differences I can adjust to are: a) include background music b) use themed transitions and text pop ups, c) do audio voice over only and d) no face footage on the bottom right corner of the screen. If this is what the community prefers, let me know. However, I can add one element to the tutorials for consideration. I can record my face while guiding viewers through the tutorial to offer a more human feel as if I'm holding your hand or you're looking over my shoulders in every step of the process.

Please let me know if you have any questions, suggestions, or commentary about my proposal.
