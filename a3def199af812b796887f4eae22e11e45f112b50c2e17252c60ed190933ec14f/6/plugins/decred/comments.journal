Walkthrough videos are great for helping people feel comfortable operating software. Having made such software walkthrough videos myself, for other projects, I think your compensation amount is reasonable.  I have an issue with the order in which you propose to cover the subjects. Jumping into Politeia for video #2 is a bit too deep too soon for people just getting their feet wet. I would like to see staking and voting come in at #2. Tutorial #3 could then be a deeper dive into becoming active in the Politeia process.  I don't think  we need a tutorial on making a Politeia proposal. People who are ready to write Politeia proposals probably don't need a software walkthrough.","signature":"84572795db60bf259d80c07b6823c4ca4b3eadafbbc4d196e77801f6e77578256d2ba3218b8601f205c1c7fb20b1e47157dd46a7f930df679d7553545e9aa70d","publickey":"1fab00e1b8f990ad9a16fcdb932462118bb506311f86a32717913d9b088eee11","commentid":"1","receipt":"121ce0eb8532e5c839118474392aa50821938bdafab8b5622ba71f79620ae91974163ce5cfcf4be01bae4cfb2ca5539b71bbd5cd8f7268de9de77b461504080a","timestamp":1550605124,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I’ve changed the order of the videos to your liking. Video #2 will be about Staking and Voting. And Video #3 will be about diving deeper into Politeia. \n \nTo be clear about the content in Video #4, my intention for this video is to include the software walkthrough and also discuss other specifics including: guidelines for putting together a proposal, discussing it on Slack, posting it on Reddit, editing proposal based off feedback, finalizing proposal and submitting it, and getting community support.\n \nAs a user, I’d like to see this content be included. I decided to add it to Video #3 as part of the deep dive into Politeia/ being active in the Politeia process. If you think this content deserves a separate video, let me know so I can change it.

I don’t see much proposals approved and rejected on Politeia, especially from marketers, and I’m hopeful that I can add value to the network with my proposal and potentially inspire many others to do the same with their own ideas.\n\n$750 not fair for 3 videos? I’d like to challenge that seeing how this price was determined and adjusted by Decred stakeholders and the support team. A majority of the responses so far have said this price is reasonable. \n\nI’ve researched the free videos for Decred Tutorials on YouTube. The videos I’m creating were chosen by determining what’s NOT already done along with seeing what I can do better. From my perspective, my detailed walk through videos are much more user-friendly, especially for novice users. These videos will be valuable because a) I will complete a FULL SET of tutorials which will cover the most important topics chosen by the community, b) I will walk people step by step as if they are looking over my shoulder, c) I will help people AVOID specific mistakes they can make in the process like not using a password manager which tends to be overlooked and undiscussed, and d) I will make fresh content for Decred made in 2019. I find it highly relevant to make updated videos since user interfaces change regularly. \n\nI agree that content creators will undoubtedly make more tutorials covering all different aspects of Decred and many will do them for free. However, since Politeia is big part of Decred, I suspect that these same content creators will pick up on the fact that they can actually get funded to do these videos and will prefer to take the Politeia approach as I am doing. I did the free videos to show my skills and seriousness. The additional videos I’m proposing to do is difficult for me to justify doing for free. I hope that’s understandable. Plus, I am proposing to do these 3 videos in under 1 month versus the unpredictable time it will take for someone else to make free videos on similar subjects which may or may not be as complete as mine. \n\nAlso, I like the video you shared. I’d like to challenge your notion about this type of production being the ONLY type of videos stakeholders finance. My suggestion for stakeholders is to fund all types of video production including documentaries, promo/ informative/ intro videos like the one you referenced, detailed walk throughs like mine, daily or weekly video blogs, interviews, presentations online and in-person, and etc. and not be limited to one style. \n\nI appreciate the commentary and hope you have a terrific day!","signature":"50b9477c380211ef4067d7bd60e86a7c7e9be86cee50af44f297bb79d555c7d2b4764e1abd49fe8d57a264fa90ae241a35b3aab7a0b8724576686ea5c06aa10c","publickey":"cd71155ab0f7944118e8a9ed46bdde77d4724f61f2c9ebffaf898308f0185b92","commentid":"10","receipt":"cda99895fceec54d1f7e865d2be05f200bc65097bf202f042a2f167455719c9198959b83ff76c9d56be4ea391e4546ee4f6adaa73fae90bf25f6bb36c9ecc403","timestamp":1550786498,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Yes, I will walk-through how to create a Politeia proposal since it's very easy to do. However, my intention is to go much deeper than that. \n\nThe recent updates for Video #3 state that I will: \"Explain to users step by step how to make a proposal starting with the guidelines for putting together a proposal, discussing it on Slack, posting it on Reddit, editing proposal based off feedback, finalizing proposal and submitting it, and getting community support.\" \n\nLet me know if you think that’s appropriate or not to include in Video #3 or if you think it deserves a separate video. Since Politeia is about proposals in general, I feel like it is appropriate to include in Video #3 because the video will appear too basic without it. \n\nBecause low quality proposals get submitted, my intention for Video #3 is to teach people how to make high-quality proposals in general (not just how to submit one) and create a basic standard on what’s expected. Therefore, Politeia will attract more high-quality proposals along with users who know how to use the entire Politeia user-interface. \n\nAnd No, Cryptocurrency.Market will not be mentioned in the videos.","signature":"bb6e003da4b1b196f758bd2a826728032d7fa9797aba4ce51ee50e9d116ce763dbdb097787e236af1b0e741cf0ab8f640ef79b28f2e2a188f59387fb863a3a04","publickey":"cd71155ab0f7944118e8a9ed46bdde77d4724f61f2c9ebffaf898308f0185b92","commentid":"13","receipt":"3b356ced1618b335f624d4497e17502629659dc52316ef079a39d57fbedb7029eb1eef802710d337f542ee0b42eb88d0ff3a538d1cfab7eddd6c9cbe0644ab01","timestamp":1550795569,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
