I agree, it's good to have more than one option to consider. Thank you also for your questions, here are my responses: \n\n**1)\tHow do you rate or evaluate DCR's PR in 2019, what did you like or dislike about the work so far, as a DCR stakeholder and as a PR person? **\n\nI think good results were achieved with the crypto press but I would have expected more mainstream pieces with the size of the team and budget. As indicated by my proposal I believe steady media outreach and keeping Decred front of mind with the media can be achieved with a lower budget and smaller team. I monitor the news daily and continuously pitch clients to relevant journalists and stories. I also make sure we’re announcing all key milestones and news-worthy activity. It’s clear the number one result the community wants from PR is quality media coverage so I believe that’s where the focus should be going forwards, as opposed to other work carried out on social media and events. I also think there are additional areas of the media we can target like personal finance outlets. \n\n**2)\tIn your view, what would be the damage if DCR doesn't have any PR firm (incl. you or Ditto)? **\n\nMedia coverage is often referred to as ‘earned media’ and for good reason. It takes time and effort to secure these articles. A journalist’s job isn’t to find companies to write about and provide free exposure, it’s to communicate relevant stories to their audience. That's why PRs work with companies to extract news, create content and communicate it to the right journalists, at the right time, in the right way. Without this work, there would be less media exposure. PR results also tend to improve over time with continued outreach, so it makes sense to build on the momentum that’s been created, as opposed to stifling it. \n\n**3)\tDoes it have to be 1-year commitment? Would you be willing to consider 6 months, like them?**\n\nMedia outreach can be a long game and securing stories can take weeks, even months which is why year (sometimes multi-year) contracts tends to be the norm. My understanding was that the community was previously hesitant to commit to a year due to the high cost. \n\nIf the feedback is still that six months would be preferable I would be willing to consider this. I can also add a clause that the community can stop working with me at any point by giving a 30-day notice.\n\n","signature":"abba583cfbad16bf83c10331353ac3ea6c2e7b81e7433f65ffc503bfe6d5775510f2b8117d435c7900d3471320fa2964cbcfb63270cfaba17a699cc939e36e07","publickey":"648456696a107c67c7c09cc361f7b464869010a644957cde6f43775576e0f360","commentid":"4","receipt":"d53445e77b684b508aab27aefab894c9f3a7f4205efa23df3c28133d309807f2b4f53e68c30152bdf843d307d579b22d469d1b2a6197d444f70688c3282bb806","timestamp":1578719670,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I appreciate your short and concise proposal, it is very much aligned with what Ditto have proposed in their second revision, focused primarily on media relations. I too would support reduction to 6 months, I think once you have built trust and confidence in delivery with stakeholders, longer terms will see more support.\n\nFirst some questions and then my general view with regards to Ditto vs Monde.\n1) Do you believe that as a single PR operator you will be able to deliver a volume of work in comparison to a team like Ditto? \n2) Do you have similar crypto related clients?\n3) Can you please expand on the news outlets and contacts you have direct access to? This is an area Ditto has strengths as they have forged relationships over the past 12 months.\n4) What are the key narrative and features that you foresee playing into Decred's strengths in 2020?\n\nRegarding competitive analysis:\nDitto are the incumbents and have experience and momentum with the project. Whilst the team size has been paired back to match the budget requirements of the project, they are still able to draw on the wider team for experience and media contacts. The Fee of $10k for 2x team members plus wider experience strikes me as only a minor premium compared to an individual contractor at $3.5k. Thus, I feel both fees are appropriate as a value for money proposition. Ditto also retain an advantage in that the scale and coverage attained for both Decred and other blockchain projects is a stronger fit than those you have presented. This is not a discredit to your work, more a reflection that stakeholders have a gauge on output and delivery from Ditto whilst Monde is more of an unknown. \n\nGood luck in the vote and I look forward to your responses.

There were several PR contractors working for Decred at the time, managing different aspects of the outreach. I came on board and helped out where I could, when I could. If voted in, this would be a clear mandate to lead the effort and manage all aspect of media outreach, so I agree that we’d seek better results than these.  \n\nWith regards to the commitment period, I’m happy to shorten it to six months. \n","signature":"195a6740b03d25feb9f9ccc00eee1145ef5e2d00db9611d0826579815a02f57c6e6247132caf7dcd1ac58681d7c759b5dd4d835aef9e4aafb1a20eeb5fac2809","publickey":"648456696a107c67c7c09cc361f7b464869010a644957cde6f43775576e0f360","commentid":"10","receipt":"ef1410bdcd139e89225d7ae54b834f5d5a7ceaa2bed7e86a76bf83585ef95345c32009535c0863706044582bf5e1bd9a7b529e1119ec211727e60513f17af80f","timestamp":1578758497,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
