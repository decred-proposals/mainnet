Thanks for submitting the Proposal, more competition is always good. What I liked here it seems stripped to the essentials only and without overselling it\nMy questions are as follows:\n1) How do you rate or evaluate DCR's PR in 2019, what did you like or dislike about the work so far, as a DCR stakeholder and as a PR person?\n2) In your view, what would be the damage if DCR doesn't have any PR firm (incl. you or Ditto)?\n3) Does it have to be 1-year commitment? Would you be willing to consider 6 months, like them?","signature":"58ac5d2d124fc76ed2e6c3624fbea6715ff803dd1a6e2b85acbb42798b4e56888e2018585e05dddef180700410817d0dfcedd9d0a72fa95c095b763c0e524704","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"3b19fb9494fb2dc45858be8eb8defa797e4befbf7a12bb3ba00e487e0546a59445a3c3a5e8d297361c0dd1b903075648807200d0eccc91c829144cf25a0b0b03","timestamp":1578686681,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
