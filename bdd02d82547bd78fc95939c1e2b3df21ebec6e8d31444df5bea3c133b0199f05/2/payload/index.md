Proposed PR activity for Decred:

PR Prep (completed in first month)
- Establish/review the target audience and the actions we want them to take.
- Looking at the PR outreach over the last year - we’ve been targeting crypto, tech and mainstream titles such as Forbes, CNBC and Mashable. 
- I would like to explore other areas of the media we can target such as personal finance outlets. People seeking advice on how to be smart with their money in terms of investing/saving should hear about Decred as a store of value. 
- I previously managed the press office for e-commerce platform TopCashback. Most of the PR activity was personal-finance related so it’s an area I’m very familiar with.  
 
Competitor Analytics: 
- Review what types of stories they’re securing in which sectors and create similar content to target these journalists/publications if relevant 
 
Create target media lists: 
- Create target media lists based on key audience demographics 
 
Create a PR Calendar including: 
- Upcoming Decred announcements (Lightning Network, DEX etc.)
- Trade shows we’re attending (to set up interviews with media ahead of time)
- Key news events/conversations we’d like to be included in by the press and pitch reactive statements to
- Story ideas we can pitch to the media to ensure continuous coverage (these could be more consumer-focused stories for personal finance press e.g. roundups of the biggest misunderstandings about crypto).
