For me 100% non-custodial needs to be 100% transparent.","signature":"e852d4b5b97f2916898cd8999fa67cc54566d7d412c4e08b4b2fbe60328e6b572b49c7044e6d49e0f2acf7086adf79755b16376e712303dfcd8b74534d0df20f","publickey":"8b9ada0d6179d50cfa1ce35814df98988517757c54f76cdbbabf6f99cce42fd8","commentid":"1","receipt":"efe51dc1c41a55469e486270222cc8a9982751d9ac9d15c57100bcd63999273050214064c4a86489fe9b47eccf3c2db20c5daf34937e90d4e78cf920a324a803","timestamp":1584715233,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
