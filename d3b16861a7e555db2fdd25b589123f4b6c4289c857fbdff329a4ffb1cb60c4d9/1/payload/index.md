### Costs

In order to add Decred as a coin integrated into the app, we need a payment to cover risks management for cryptocurrency conversion and to pay for running an instance of blockbook for Decred. 

In order the add Decred, we are asking for **5,000 USD paid on DCR.**

Besides adding the coin, we want to propose to the Decred community the addition to the app and maintain a lifetime low fee rate. Coins are usually charged 4% fee for gift cards purchase and 2% fee for Shift between coins. If this proposal gets accepted we are going to maintain a lifetime 1% fee for gift card purchases and shifts.

Feel free to ask me anything you want.
