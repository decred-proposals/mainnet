Moderation of Decred Communications

## What

This proposal seeks to establish a formal budget for moderating the main Decred communication platforms: Matrix, Politeia, Reddit, Discord, and Telegram.

Moderation means filtering content posted by users. That is, deciding which posts to remove as abusive, and taking measures to prevent such posts in the future.

## Why

- Contractor productivity: Certain chat rooms are used to coordinate important work and any persistent distraction is undesirable.
- Stakeholder productivity: In a direct voting system like Decred, stakeholder attention is a scarce and extremely valuable resource that must not be wasted on trolling, FUD and excess repetition of the same ideas.
- Prepare for growth: Decred community is still small and moderation of comms can be handled by few mods. As the community grows there will be more incidents that require mod attention. Dedicated resources will make us better prepared.
- Moderator incentives: Timezone coverage is still not perfect which leads to some unwanted content hanging around for longer than it should, and in the case of Reddit, some legit content being automatically blocked for longer than it should. A formal budget will be an incentive to improve this.
- Clarity: Historically, not all community members agreed that moderators should be paid by the Treasury. Some moderators are also not certain whether they can bill for their work and how much. A formal proposal will clear this up for everyone. If it is rejected, it will mean that moderators should not bill the Treasury for this work (until they submit a better proposal and it is approved).
- This proposal is part of the process to approve all Treasury-funded expenses via Politeia.

## How

This proposal only covers platforms that are considered "most important" at the moment:

- Matrix (matrix.decred.org server, accessible via [chat.decred.org](https://chat.decred.org/) or any other [client](https://matrix.org/clients/))
- Politeia ([proposals.decred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/))
- Reddit ([r/decred](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/))
- Discord ([discord.gg/GJ2GXfz](https://discord.gg/GJ2GXfz))
- Telegram ([t.me/decred](https://t.me/decred), [t.me/DecredSupport](https://t.me/DecredSupport))

Here are examples of what moderators need to do:

- be available every day, which is especially important for Matrix chats that are used to coordinate work
- for Politeia, read all proposals carefully before publishing and keep up with the comments
- for Discord, verify new users to grant them post permissions
- implement moderation policy, remove unwanted content, warn and ban violating users
- handle disputes around unfair mod action
- configure platforms' built-in moderation tools, install and configure additional mod plugins and bots
- check and approve valid content that was blocked by automated tools (e.g. Reddit's AutoModerator)
- adapt the policy as new non-trivial incidents occur

This proposal _does not_ cover:

- platforms with insignificant user posting activity (e.g. Facebook)
- non-English platforms that have their own budgets (e.g. [Brazil](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f986c3ea2fed2ea074c377a89f1a4b956ea0d527a8b6c099a5a8f175beb5) or [Latam](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b677462d6d22d61bf786798e975b38df7a203c2467429d4ec91f75ef0c40) proposals)
- in order to minimize scope, this proposal deliberately does not include _content creation_ work, such as posting updates/outreach on the platforms listed above

The goal of this proposal is to establish funding for moderation, it is _not_ to vote for any specific moderation policy. Should there be any disagreement on policy for mission-critical comm platforms, it should be voted in other proposals. Just for reference, the policy is following the [Decred Constitution](https://docs.decred.org/governance/decred-constitution/#principles) principles:

> _Free Speech and Consideration_ - Everyone has the right to communicate opinions and ideas without fear of censorship. Consideration shall be given to all constructive speech that is based in fact and reason.

## Who

Everyone included in this proposal is serving as a moderator for many months or years and is a well known community member. Some have resources to not bill for the work, reducing the overall cost.

- bee: Reddit
- degeri: Matrix, Reddit
- Exitus: Discord
- Haon: Matrix, Discord, Telegram, Reddit
- jz: Matrix, Discord, Telegram, Reddit
- jy-p: Matrix, Politeia
- mr.black: Telegram
- richardred: Politeia
- solar128: Reddit

**Continuity plan**

My role as a proposal owner will be to check that billing is reasonable, write a report at the end of the term, and submit the next proposal to prolong the program. In the event I am unable to do so due to some unforeseen circumstances, @degeri and @richardred have kindly agreed to pick up this role. Other options will be to shut down the proposal or have an all-contractor vote so that someone can take over until the renewal.

## Budget

The proposal will be limited to $10,200 for 6 months, with the expected amount of $5,400. This translates to an average monthly $1,700 limit and $900 expected. Only work performed will be billed and any unused resources will stay in the Treasury. The composition is explained below.

For Reddit the limit is 2 hours per month per moderator. Keeping Reddit clean requires just a few minutes per day and in practice it takes ~1 h per month per moderator.

For chats the limit is 10 hours per month per moderator, while I expect to see 5 h or less. While it is enough to check Reddit a few times a day and process content in batches, chats require more hours to continuously monitor activity and react quickly. In case of Matrix, chats are also more mission-critical since they are used to coordinate work. Moderator's availability is a key part of the deliverable here.

Designing fair compensation for moderating chats is non-trivial. On the one hand, chat mods are reading chats anyway to stay up-to-date and do other work, so paying for _all_ that time is too much. On the other hand, serving as a moderator requires more commitment than being just a reader, _and_ you have to read much more rooms vs just following a few topics of interest. The cap of 10 billable hours per month is chosen as a balance between the two and should make for less than 5% of time that the moderator is available.

Per-platform breakdown of monthly expected/maximum USD:

- Discord: $240 / $300
- Matrix: $120 / $200
- Politeia: $300 / $600
- Reddit: $110 / $220
- Telegram: $120 / $200
- reserve: $0 / $180

The reserve is added to the monthly limit to account for activity unforeseen by the estimates of individual moderators.

## When

This proposal will run for 6 months between August 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. A new proposal will be submitted at the end of the term or earlier if the budget is depleted.

A report will be published at the end of the term.

## Risks

1\. Paid moderation may attract unethical behavior from existing or new moderators.

Addressed by: limited monthly expense, limited scope, and cross-checking with peer mods. Invoice peer review features currently in development will help to streamline this process.

2\. Paid moderation may result in a sub-optimal outcome compared to a purely volunteer-based system.

> Most communities literally get this done for free, people are happy to contribute something on a casual basis. If we put out a call for volunteer mods I have no doubt many would rise to the occasion. Now if we told people they can bill, the same would be true and I suspect we'd attract way worse quality candidates. This is one of those situations where us having money makes things more difficult and will likely result in a sub-optimal outcome. (jz)

This is a valid concern. If we need to quickly onboard new moderators to handle an influx of new users, paid moderation may make things complicated. It is partially addressed by careful onboarding of new moderators by the existing team, which is required anyway because moderators must be very stable people with proven track record (e.g. must not censor based on emotions).

I think we should try and see how it works. If this risk turns out to be true, one option will be to not renew this proposal.
