I'm ok with any outcome. If it is rejected, we will adjust/try again/reorganize and moderation will not stop. If it is approved, this will be a fair reward and an extra incentive for moderators' continuous work.\n\nI understand your position and I'm glad you voiced it because I think many people think this way.\n\nTo address some of your points:\n\nReddit is only 10% of this proposal's budget. Politeia is perhaps the most critical part (proposal submissions require careful review), followed by Matrix rooms (keeping chats usable and productive requires high availability). If this prop is rejected I might try a reduced version with only these two platforms, although the other ones are important for onboarding users.\n\nSpeaking of Reddit, r/decred can indeed work without paid mods just like the others. But Decred doesn't have to follow everything others do and can do it differently. I think paid moderation can be more sustainable.\n\nDecred is not just an open-source project and is not just a business. It is a new kind that combines both. It has intrinsic funding unlike most open-source projects that can't afford high quality expertise or give up and sell to VC money. Unlike most businesses, Decred can afford to be open in many ways and release stuff for public use, vs bothering about \"value capture\" and hiding things to stay ahead.\n\nI prefer to think \"is this useful work? should it be paid? how much?\" and not in terms of (and depending on) other projects that get X, Y or Z for free.\n\nPersonally, I believe that all useful work must be rewarded, and moderation is useful and under-appreciated work because it \"just works\". I will be happy if it gains more recognition. And who knows, maybe if Decred shows an example, those other projects will notice and self-organize to reward moderators too?\n\n_P.S. No need to preemptively call for downvotes. I upvote anything that adds to the discussion :)_","signature":"72ab8d8e6149e8f4bdab47624789b8997295eb87c37291231ebb2dc780f9c836268a520f931550a43410150bf643a8efbb7acc87ca71dc9c00772635722da907","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"2","receipt":"7c4793be591f1124116839b8555b94d649c9dc6b84526d05cb92495c2a687b7c5157295e25f2056669ebe80f870c50b8a8f3a4b11f562cd7fd28d7f79342e605","timestamp":1595723112,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The idea is sound, and the budget is very reasonable. However, in my opinion (and you also mentioned it youself), the decred community size has not reach the critical point where a proper and paid moderation is warranted just yet.  I know some of you may have volunteered and done this indirectly. From what i can see, there has been no serious \"out-of-control\" FUD or troll that's plaguing these channel so far, definitely nothing at the level where a paid moderator is needed. I also think that this can be a volunteer job for now until we come a point when it is no longer sustainable, then maybe we can re-visit the idea of paid moderators. But until then, i would have to say no to this proposal no matter what cost it is.","signature":"1a0dd42c487a950d1b2cdbfd373eeeff51994660a723ab7d0e3839d788e22d3d6172f0010d331d9d25306aa0182d1ad7efa72cf7e9c3a4d6f66c6f8a0a5bb501","publickey":"a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c","commentid":"4","receipt":"0c673257cf06dca19c905e53fdb3653901c8401c23c2ad2fa528b94232f58995e5bd82d6bde37d4aad8c5963fe66411f919a5b25b92faab02eb591ca14522b02","timestamp":1595743725,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

(You might have noticed a reduction in spam in the last ~6 months) \n\n\nMatrix - \n\nMatrix the main source of spam is the feeds from reddit (which is less now) and telegram (101 channel). \n\nWe do sometimes have some people come in and start fudding (usually via discord or the bridged channels) but the decision to remove them requires multiple people to agree. Hence not done immediately. \n\nYet to see any automated spam on matrix. But  that might change at any point. \n\nHow I moderate matrix - \n\n- Enable mobile notifications.

Any new message that get posted is shown to me on top of work I am doing, I then decide on any actions needed. \n\n\nHow to bill for this has always been a conundrum for me. It is quiet ridiculous to bill for ~15 hours a day. But clearly there is work being done which keeps me away from my other work (even if momentarily).\n\nThe values given above I feel strike a fair balance.

I'll vote no for some reason, first of all, you bring the risks and the community is not ready to pay for them. Another risk is to lose volunteers that do some jobs without asking for money e.g. someone who is a volunteer with technical support will stop or decrease the help if someone is paid to dedicate themselves to it. Really thing that Decred had space for various proposals right now, these things just when we get very big.\n\nAbout Politeia mod, I agree with pay for that, not know because you don't have a lot of proposals every time and a lot of volunteers to get in that.\n\nMatrix, is our coordinating tool, things need to be discussed with everyone, sometimes offtopic in channels is boring, but all discussion is needed and, as a dev contractor, I don't feel bothered.\n\nIn case someone is tired of this type of volunteer work and wants help or pass the stick, you can DM me, I divide a little of my time between work and volunteering without problems.","signature":"ecfdca90ef76bd56e99400eed7612427b4cd860fdbe5797f9ac0527122959b634aa9489124216991600ac74a1b2793c64d46a5b509f766cadaed82681bb58e00","publickey":"8b9ada0d6179d50cfa1ce35814df98988517757c54f76cdbbabf6f99cce42fd8","commentid":"6","receipt":"1490e4397dd8ebc8077ab4f37a7ddbdd3dac0592510db20759e2eedad335983597dc4cd56c2de2a3a18bee36e6789a9e08fde3b1d743c391c77a7d8e9cec3c0e","timestamp":1595758321,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In my opinion, I think it should be something that is done more on a volunteer basis and where the community self-moderates.  There could be multiple people assigned (as outlined) across the various social media platforms that are known.  Then if moderation is needed, the community can tag them to intervene .  I'm sure most are already on those social media platforms daily, if not weekly and it wouldn't be much extra work.  Additionally, I would think those in the community wouldn't mind volunteering to moderate, following a set of guidelines.  If you have enough participation, then the workload should be distributed.  If you're looking for volunteers, I'd be willing.","signature":"4c374d273e559d39f04931c15d247a644cab9d60fb2190a69b3fa1813e3c5edaa112e055cf2a8d425358e593aca98fd4c41af6a4db65dd344607955b5a790608","publickey":"29d2d833d0792acc617ff92c103f2b8183cf88a8d9abff1f72f17b6787fc3e68","commentid":"7","receipt":"5ec47a5aa1f207bfe55924c898b9037e9f89e4a6ed7b003ff0118e974f55d3047e62eead36c80605cc18e31ceb0eb84a73d7e4f91b7138f42f39134a796ed102","timestamp":1595801132,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In this case I share most of your concerns regarding reddit and other socials. I understand that we are in a difficult place where community is large enough that moderation is required,  but still too small for volunteers to organize and take this role organically on a larger scale. IMO as Decred isn't a company, we should hope for the community to organize more like \"unofficial\"/r/  or fan forums like we see for many subject. But I have no idea how to get there, or if paid moderators could hinder the process of getting there...\n\nHowever I do see a distinction when it comes to the primary chat platform. Being an open-source project isn't the same thing as having development and dev communications occurring in the public space. We can just look at the massive number of open-source projects in crypto, or from private entities, where there is no way for anyone to see what is going on or to talk with devs directly, outside of filling a git-hub issue and hoping it gets attention.  From my experience, having an open platform that anyone can join and interact directly with devs is extremely rare and a powerful tool for the community to have. In this particular case,  if moderation is an issue, I would most definitely prefer having the treasury paying for moderation and keep the space clean and efficient for dev work, than risk losing this environment, and have devs migrate to private coms like it's usually the norm...","signature":"69867e8950c7fdf3780ae67755560119a22d4cf0b3031c7b6751333baa1f0586e17d83cb7eab05e844924d4ae047c5268193323043d0cc85cd39c2085771f20e","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"8","receipt":"c3f503f4f7f3285a20014f1c3fce3a7f2716b5f44fa8e638cb661f48e8406e1534bc32ae8bb199443bb24faa3b6d424cc3a566fd333efc8b0c062202dc60be0a","timestamp":1595812631,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
