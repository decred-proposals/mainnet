I congratulate you for it. Stuff is moving in a good direction.\nPeople have been paid to mod, paid to tweet, paid to do who knows what. Finally, all this stuff is moving to Politeia! This *is* a good development.\nBut if  /r/bitcoin and /r/monero can do without \"paid mods\", why can't /r/decred? Why only /r/decred needs paid mods? (Well, I know TRON and such projects have paid mods, but PoW coins like Monero, Grin, etc. don't.)\n\"Professional moderators\" is a bad idea, only businesses have that usually. Is Decred a business or an open-source project?  I still don't know the answer to that question myself, to be honest. Downvote away.   : )","signature":"88c715f70ac49cf749d1845f34f0bc60a79def50de7097943a959f5249a731b0141fb506e55f87a390ae99170ab6683745a495ac47a84a25b8f8c17e9cadb600","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"a3df6de144cc833e7ba081f4078f2c8698d823097192efccf6ff0d5b2741bcce5983bc259c47a4a68b70999325c205e90cf146c8cb90dd41fb753ed468867b0a","timestamp":1595713775,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
