I congratulate you for it. Stuff is moving in a good direction.\nPeople have been paid to mod, paid to tweet, paid to do who knows what. Finally, all this stuff is moving to Politeia! This *is* a good development.\nBut if  /r/bitcoin and /r/monero can do without \"paid mods\", why can't /r/decred? Why only /r/decred needs paid mods? (Well, I know TRON and such projects have paid mods, but PoW coins like Monero, Grin, etc. don't.)\n\"Professional moderators\" is a bad idea, only businesses have that usually. Is Decred a business or an open-source project?  I still don't know the answer to that question myself, to be honest.

I'm ok with any outcome. If it is rejected, we will adjust/try again/reorganize and moderation will not stop. If it is approved, this will be a fair reward and an extra incentive for moderators' continuous work.\n\nI understand your position and I'm glad you voiced it because I think many people think this way.\n\nTo address some of your points:\n\nReddit is only 10% of this proposal's budget. Politeia is perhaps the most critical part (proposal submissions require careful review), followed by Matrix rooms (keeping chats usable and productive requires high availability). If this prop is rejected I might try a reduced version with only these two platforms, although the other ones are important for onboarding users.\n\nSpeaking of Reddit, r/decred can indeed work without paid mods just like the others. But Decred doesn't have to follow everything others do and can do it differently. I think paid moderation can be more sustainable.\n\nDecred is not just an open-source project and is not just a business. It is a new kind that combines both. It has intrinsic funding unlike most open-source projects that can't afford high quality expertise or give up and sell to VC money. Unlike most businesses, Decred can afford to be open in many ways and release stuff for public use, vs bothering about \"value capture\" and hiding things to stay ahead.\n\nI prefer to think \"is this useful work? should it be paid? how much?\" and not in terms of (and depending on) other projects that get X, Y or Z for free.\n\nPersonally, I believe that all useful work must be rewarded, and moderation is useful and under-appreciated work because it \"just works\". I will be happy if it gains more recognition. And who knows, maybe if Decred shows an example, those other projects will notice and self-organize to reward moderators too?\n\n_P.S. No need to preemptively call for downvotes. I upvote anything that adds to the discussion :)_","signature":"72ab8d8e6149e8f4bdab47624789b8997295eb87c37291231ebb2dc780f9c836268a520f931550a43410150bf643a8efbb7acc87ca71dc9c00772635722da907","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"2","receipt":"7c4793be591f1124116839b8555b94d649c9dc6b84526d05cb92495c2a687b7c5157295e25f2056669ebe80f870c50b8a8f3a4b11f562cd7fd28d7f79342e605","timestamp":1595723112,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
