I'm ok with any outcome. If it is rejected, we will adjust/try again/reorganize and moderation will not stop. If it is approved, this will be a fair reward and an extra incentive for moderators' continuous work.\n\nI understand your position and I'm glad you voiced it because I think many people think this way.\n\nTo address some of your points:\n\nReddit is only 10% of this proposal's budget. Politeia is perhaps the most critical part (proposal submissions require careful review), followed by Matrix rooms (keeping chats usable and productive requires high availability). If this prop is rejected I might try a reduced version with only these two platforms, although the other ones are important for onboarding users.\n\nSpeaking of Reddit, r/decred can indeed work without paid mods just like the others. But Decred doesn't have to follow everything others do and can do it differently. I think paid moderation can be more sustainable.\n\nDecred is not just an open-source project and is not just a business. It is a new kind that combines both. It has intrinsic funding unlike most open-source projects that can't afford high quality expertise or give up and sell to VC money. Unlike most businesses, Decred can afford to be open in many ways and release stuff for public use, vs bothering about \"value capture\" and hiding things to stay ahead.\n\nI prefer to think \"is this useful work? should it be paid? how much?\" and not in terms of (and depending on) other projects that get X, Y or Z for free.\n\nPersonally, I believe that all useful work must be rewarded, and moderation is useful and under-appreciated work because it \"just works\". I will be happy if it gains more recognition. And who knows, maybe if Decred shows an example, those other projects will notice and self-organize to reward moderators too?\n\n_P.S. No need to preemptively call for downvotes. I upvote anything that adds to the discussion :)_","signature":"72ab8d8e6149e8f4bdab47624789b8997295eb87c37291231ebb2dc780f9c836268a520f931550a43410150bf643a8efbb7acc87ca71dc9c00772635722da907","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"2","receipt":"7c4793be591f1124116839b8555b94d649c9dc6b84526d05cb92495c2a687b7c5157295e25f2056669ebe80f870c50b8a8f3a4b11f562cd7fd28d7f79342e605","timestamp":1595723112,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The idea is sound, and the budget is very reasonable. However, in my opinion (and you also mentioned it youself), the decred community size has not reach the critical point where a proper and paid moderation is warranted just yet.  I know some of you may have volunteered and done this indirectly. From what i can see, there has been no serious \"out-of-control\" FUD or troll that's plaguing these channel so far, definitely nothing at the level where a paid moderator is needed. I also think that this can be a volunteer job for now until we come a point when it is no longer sustainable, then maybe we can re-visit the idea of paid moderators. But until then, i would have to say no to this proposal no matter what cost it is.","signature":"1a0dd42c487a950d1b2cdbfd373eeeff51994660a723ab7d0e3839d788e22d3d6172f0010d331d9d25306aa0182d1ad7efa72cf7e9c3a4d6f66c6f8a0a5bb501","publickey":"a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c","commentid":"4","receipt":"0c673257cf06dca19c905e53fdb3653901c8401c23c2ad2fa528b94232f58995e5bd82d6bde37d4aad8c5963fe66411f919a5b25b92faab02eb591ca14522b02","timestamp":1595743725,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

(You might have noticed a reduction in spam in the last ~6 months) \n\n\nMatrix - \n\nMatrix the main source of spam is the feeds from reddit (which is less now) and telegram (101 channel). \n\nWe do sometimes have some people come in and start fudding (usually via discord or the bridged channels) but the decision to remove them requires multiple people to agree. Hence not done immediately. \n\nYet to see any automated spam on matrix. But  that might change at any point. \n\nHow I moderate matrix - \n\n- Enable mobile notifications.

Any new message that get posted is shown to me on top of work I am doing, I then decide on any actions needed. \n\n\nHow to bill for this has always been a conundrum for me. It is quiet ridiculous to bill for ~15 hours a day. But clearly there is work being done which keeps me away from my other work (even if momentarily).\n\nThe values given above I feel strike a fair balance.

Really thing that Decred had space for various proposals right now, these things just when we get very big.\n\nAbout Politeia mod, I agree with pay for that, not know because you don't have a lot of proposals every time and a lot of volunteers to get in that.\n\nMatrix, is our coordinating tool, things need to be discussed with everyone, sometimes offtopic in channels is boring, but all discussion is needed and, as a dev contractor, I don't feel bothered.\n\nIn case someone is tired of this type of volunteer work and wants help or pass the stick, you can DM me, I divide a little of my time between work and volunteering without problems.","signature":"ecfdca90ef76bd56e99400eed7612427b4cd860fdbe5797f9ac0527122959b634aa9489124216991600ac74a1b2793c64d46a5b509f766cadaed82681bb58e00","publickey":"8b9ada0d6179d50cfa1ce35814df98988517757c54f76cdbbabf6f99cce42fd8","commentid":"6","receipt":"1490e4397dd8ebc8077ab4f37a7ddbdd3dac0592510db20759e2eedad335983597dc4cd56c2de2a3a18bee36e6789a9e08fde3b1d743c391c77a7d8e9cec3c0e","timestamp":1595758321,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In my opinion, I think it should be something that is done more on a volunteer basis and where the community self-moderates.  There could be multiple people assigned (as outlined) across the various social media platforms that are known.  Then if moderation is needed, the community can tag them to intervene .  I'm sure most are already on those social media platforms daily, if not weekly and it wouldn't be much extra work.  Additionally, I would think those in the community wouldn't mind volunteering to moderate, following a set of guidelines.  If you have enough participation, then the workload should be distributed.  If you're looking for volunteers, I'd be willing.","signature":"4c374d273e559d39f04931c15d247a644cab9d60fb2190a69b3fa1813e3c5edaa112e055cf2a8d425358e593aca98fd4c41af6a4db65dd344607955b5a790608","publickey":"29d2d833d0792acc617ff92c103f2b8183cf88a8d9abff1f72f17b6787fc3e68","commentid":"7","receipt":"5ec47a5aa1f207bfe55924c898b9037e9f89e4a6ed7b003ff0118e974f55d3047e62eead36c80605cc18e31ceb0eb84a73d7e4f91b7138f42f39134a796ed102","timestamp":1595801132,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In this case I share most of your concerns regarding reddit and other socials. I understand that we are in a difficult place where community is large enough that moderation is required,  but still too small for volunteers to organize and take this role organically on a larger scale. IMO as Decred isn't a company, we should hope for the community to organize more like \"unofficial\"/r/  or fan forums like we see for many subject. But I have no idea how to get there, or if paid moderators could hinder the process of getting there...\n\nHowever I do see a distinction when it comes to the primary chat platform. Being an open-source project isn't the same thing as having development and dev communications occurring in the public space. We can just look at the massive number of open-source projects in crypto, or from private entities, where there is no way for anyone to see what is going on or to talk with devs directly, outside of filling a git-hub issue and hoping it gets attention.  From my experience, having an open platform that anyone can join and interact directly with devs is extremely rare and a powerful tool for the community to have. In this particular case,  if moderation is an issue, I would most definitely prefer having the treasury paying for moderation and keep the space clean and efficient for dev work, than risk losing this environment, and have devs migrate to private coms like it's usually the norm...","signature":"69867e8950c7fdf3780ae67755560119a22d4cf0b3031c7b6751333baa1f0586e17d83cb7eab05e844924d4ae047c5268193323043d0cc85cd39c2085771f20e","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"8","receipt":"c3f503f4f7f3285a20014f1c3fce3a7f2716b5f44fa8e638cb661f48e8406e1534bc32ae8bb199443bb24faa3b6d424cc3a566fd333efc8b0c062202dc60be0a","timestamp":1595812631,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My main concern was that it would be too open-ended and allow for anybody to attempt to claim they do mod work and see what they could get away with in terms of billing. That's not really a concern of mine with the reasonable scope, budget, and people named therein, all of whom have long track records of delivering good work for the project in other domains.\n\nModeration requires constant attention but very little action, so while the amounts being allocated aren't large it's still a nice acknowledgment and reward for the people who will be diligently monitoring the various channels. I expect we'll get better consistency and coverage using this approach rather than having a bunch of randos addressing things in an ad-hoc manner. Having specific people named in a proposal adds accountability and transparency which is also a plus.

For just one example, people have been free until now to speak about old ideas which have already been discussed (even if the community expresses their disapproval). This behaviour is specifically called out as being problematic by the proposal, but this should not be used as justification to shutdown and/or censor these people.  The same point applies to the \"FUD\" and \"trolling\" behaviours called out by the proposal - these are subjective terms, and the definitions are debatable. In short - this proposal should serve solely to grant payment to moderators, and absolutely not \"extend their powers\" or grant them any type of censorship rights on subjective issues.","signature":"648434f1c8370a3c62a6e312f120e871c2c1e48c6e994f3e0cbd1c36ab4efc57d53efbc59c28f256063b934d7118ae5ef697ef7b6b62d0e0b28b5dcfc9b89407","publickey":"071af787d56946d6283bd68574d8f61e9aa1891b63bb6e0e1874606be8836a0c","commentid":"10","receipt":"ae6838bcb6aeb9d9b0ddb23c7680c8086a34c9657b4ca28e94cd2093fac7fe053921ac3e11708f11dc26c118fda15926c37dd93c3dbb89589cde93c1cb04540b","timestamp":1595841121,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is the first time I'm going through the proposal process and I begin to appreciate (even more) all the leadership/coordination work being done across various teams. It takes quite some time to figure out all the details with the all people involved, plan, answer questions, etc.\n\nI agree that overall the situation is not out of control right now but let me add some details.\n\n\u003e the decred community size has not reach the critical point where a proper and paid moderation is warranted just yet\n\nPlease note that all work described in the proposal is _already_ happening at the _current_ size of the community (see the \"expected\" figures), plus I added some room for growth (the \"limit\" figures), but that will not be used if not necessary.\n\n\u003e From what i can see, there has been no serious \"out-of-control\" FUD or troll that's plaguing these channel so far\n\nThis is exactly what you should observe if moderators are doing their jobs.\n\nI can mention some examples from Reddit since I moderate it for 2 years now.\n\nWe had a few cases where small groups of randos showed up out of nowhere and FUDded about certain aspects of the project, only to stop engaging and disappear forever after a day or two. Sometimes I posted \"moderator's analysis\" like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/96j9ai/transparency_in_payments_made_with_the_community/e41vaut/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/8hlhtf/considering_the_lack_of_talent_and_the_8_million/dz5npgy/) in the same thread to warn other users.\n\nThe most interesting Reddit incident so far was the \"spam ring\" I identified in 2018 where ~40 users posted innocent-looking (sometimes even reasonable) comments that likely have been generated from various articles on the web. Interestingly, they were not strictly anti or pro Decred, and posted a mixture of positive, negative, neutral statements and even questions. It was around 100 comments spanning 40 threads. I don't know what was the goal of their master, but I can imagine that it could be used to control the narrative. I reproted the \"gang\" to Reddit and didn't see anything of that scale since then.\n\nFor chats, while I don't have a good picture, I see that a few troublemakers are banned once in a while to keep the place productive.","signature":"d8f3b97afbf16cdb7839f6815f13e2a17d8c53ddc7620206ab4fddbe51679f0c3d3d3aca6301efba4c8ed3f605ac8623705a6b35ab375b37618bc571102b2d07","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"14","receipt":"fb3c1e97df52b07f95691e51e7c186137987f372fef19f70174bf7c3e626a56882eb7929317f4b3b057f43e2f8a2d29d996b2bbb8851573eacd76a310eb9ac0c","timestamp":1595963797,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But support work is very important for onboarding users. My idea is that, rather than not paying moderators to not discourage volunteer support people, I suggest that support people self-organize and submit a proposal like this to fund their important work.\n\nI cannot say for other projects, but I guess that not many have a strong support force like Decred. With formal funding and more hands, it could be developed further into a unique system where crypto users not only get software with ever improving UX, they also get full-time human support without purchasing any products.

These people are also well positioned to submit bug reports to fix common UX pain points.\n\nBut outside the support area (2) I think yes, some paid work might affect existing or future volunteers in same area.

It is when they start saying the same thing over and over and monopolize the chat room, is when the mods have to take action.

In practice though, when the case is not clear several mods often chime in to comment before any action is taken, and most (if not all) people who got banned never tried to reach out and dispute it, which might suggest the level of their interest in the project.","signature":"76d43aed4f4257c24661cc401275e1c659cf1c0e6fcf1d2ede68370240562ec7cab4931eac2e704b2d24f821fb8a327c0603c23b76f2ab28e6ad231087a2f80b","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"19","receipt":"3437918e13e184af07a6daf4edcb2129ca254790598eb60025360df24cc88fff61ef4537d3d3b6e3f8989efe507d01374950ac3f5ac64ff84497731db505270d","timestamp":1595965237,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Those of us who live in reality understand that platforms have to be moderated or else they turn into ripe ground for fudders, trolls and spammers, e.g. see forum.decred.org.  In the context of projects that are not about creating new forms of money, it is much easier to let things run wild and not maintain them.  However, when there are large amounts of money involved, malicious actors are incentivized to fud and troll to affect the exchange rate, which they can profit from by trading.  These malicious actors exist and need to have their actions policed episodically.\n\nWhile you can claim that /r/bitcoin and /r/monero do not use paid mods, it is almost certainly not the case.  Since those projects have very limited transparency, we have no idea how they manage their communities.  /r/bitcoin has become increasingly censorious over the years, and it is clear there is policy being dictated there, likely by a central group.  It is easy to criticize what you can see and hard to criticize what you can't see, so trying to compare these subreddits makes for a poor argument.\n\nIt is tiresome to see an endless stream of negativity from praxis because he presumably over-invested in Decred and has struggled to cope with his own (poor) decision making.

We have tried winging it and seeing how it goes without any administration, and it leads to lots of junk on our platforms - spam, fudding, and trolling.  Currently, we're pretty permissive with content and really only police the spam, trolling and fudding.\n\nLimiting the billing for this work to a maximum of 1,500 USD per month is very reasonable and formalizes a reduction in billing for this work, which was one of the main goals of putting this proposal up.  Some stakeholders, e.g. praxis, are keen to cancel everything they don't like, but the reality is that some stuff should not be outright canceled.  I support putting distinct limitations on what can be billed for this work, and I do not support canceling this work because I have seen what happens with nobody at the wheel.\n\nWe go to war with the army we have, and the army we have has been billing too much for this work.
