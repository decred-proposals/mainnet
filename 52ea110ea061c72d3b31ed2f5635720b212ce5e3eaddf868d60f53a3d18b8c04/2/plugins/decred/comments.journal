How can we assess engagement, how effective those publications were? I know this is very tricky to quantify, but in this post you say:\n\n\u003e Decred’s awareness and visibility have significantly increased in the last six months, \n\n... as this was a fact, but how do you reckon? In the AMA you provided anecdotal examples, like your own personal experience form conferences, a personal feeling that awareness is growing,.. but as a stakeholder I'd like to see something more tangible and numerical... what metric do you think would be relevant, if any? Pageviews on decred.org? Google Trends? Exchange rate?\n\nOr perhaps that is outside the scope of Ditto, should we direct those questions more at the marketing (Dustorf?) instead?\n\nIf awareness is growing, surely there must be some kind of measurable effect, that awareness cannot just exist in a vacuum, it needs to result in some kind of action: either Googling about it, or downloading the client, or buying the coin...? The metrics that are accessible to me do not show any significant boost in awareness, so all that remains is the anecdotal \u0026 feeling that it is growing, but how can stakeholders assess that? \n\nBecause like you say, DCR is often not even mentioned in many articles about crypto governance, which is very strange since we should dominate this conversation, as you rightfully state. I certainly don't blame Ditto for that, but awareness obviously hasn't grown **that** much?\n\nI'm aware Rome wasn't built in a day, but as a voting entity I need to try to find the weak/critical points, the good things speak for themselves anyway. \n\nYou write:\n\n\u003e Now that it has broader awareness, \n\nAs if this was already common knowledge agreed upon and established.\nBut what is the evidence for it? \n\n\u003eEmpower community\n\nYes, I especially like this part. There is potential there.\nI'm thinking DCR PR\u0026Marketing needs more out-of-the-box approaches, they have demonstrably worked in the past.\n\nGood luck \u0026 thank you!","signature":"b2d140657430e7723ef180d4a7bacc67c1c88c101d01ae922513447245b1d681f1dd5735de03f91d885f3f6093dd7605e587614bf2a8e93478d2b1b9efb25f06","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"65b59cefcd860872c19dd62089c09f895e0a49b5880db8fd37467be22604a7d8b0696a46982829c34100f4bb79101fd7bf7406c14b38aa1d0575da64098e9e06","timestamp":1559149292,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We agree we should think about how to more closely measure success. Ditto spent the first 6 months proving ourselves, and we hope we’ve shown what we can do and that we deliver on our promises. In phase 1, we stuck to the basic metric of how many stories, bylines, and tier-one coverage we generated for Decred. Anecdotally, people tell us all the time that they’re seeing Decred everywhere. Just last week, a fund that’s also a future client approached us to take a position on Decred. We at Ditto are seeing it first-hand because we’re deep in the community everyday. We’ve also talked to community members like JZ and Jake, who say they’ve noticed an uptick in awareness at conferences and meetings.\n\nBut you’re right — that doesn’t tell the whole story. \n\nIn the first 6 months, an important metric for increased awareness was that Ditto has introduced 50+ of the leading crypto journalists to Decred. As the gatekeepers to the entire crypto community, journalists’ awareness carries immense, long-term weight, because in many cases their stories are people’s first touch point into Decred. When we first started talking to journalists at the end of 2018, the majority of them had never heard of Decred. Now, every single one of them is not only aware of Decred, but is well on the way towards associating it with staking and governance. The seeds have been planted, and we’re starting to see the results. \n\nAwareness is an important strategy in a bear market. Now, as things start to thaw and we prepare Decred to be in the best position possible during the bull run, what numbers should we be looking at?\n\nIn the next 6 months, there’s an opportunity to dive into more detail. Of all the metrics you mentioned, the most readily accessible is page views. Many of our clients have websites, home pages, or reports they want to drive traffic to. What are the priority web properties for Decred: Decred Journal? Decred.org? Medium page? In the proposal, we talk about creating more educational materials on the website, then getting those links placed in stories and driving traffic to those materials. One of the benefits to creating resources and making sure they’re socialized strategically is that we can measure clicks. The better and more sophisticated web presence we build, the more chances we’ll have to tie those to our PR efforts and measure web traffic. Ditto would need view access to Decred’s Google Analytics or other backend analytics so we can assess exactly how many people are clicking on backlinks in stories, which backlinks are most popular, which countries readers live in, etc. \n\nOther potential metrics include Twitter following, participation rates on Politeia, number of community members, number of contributors, etc. We’ve even talked about measuring awareness and sentiment at conferences. When people come to the Decred booth or approach a Decred rep, are there 3-4 questions we can ask to help us as we think about measurement and moving the needle on awareness/understanding of Decred? Metrics like these might be trickier because they’re affected by many variables besides just PR, but they could serve as long-term benchmarks. Ditto doesn’t have full visibility into all these metrics, so we would need the community’s help with gathering this information so we can measure our efforts against it over time.","signature":"1eb7302e27e230f446a2280361622856f12a92c8977eb4d7c3168d419c79de88cea5206d34ea0ced407eda3bc5eac1924e048165ef568afdd501ab6b2aa8f304","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"2","receipt":"b37ccc5d6d64344ce40d7aeb96eac8ee67ba0b926f991a25320d0d1399644feb36079fa4340bc42438778497c966efa647683c9758899a96039100b2b046c000","timestamp":1559153885,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
