How can we assess engagement, how effective those publications were? I know this is very tricky to quantify, but in this post you say:\n\n\u003e Decredâ€™s awareness and visibility have significantly increased in the last six months, \n\n... as this was a fact, but how do you reckon? In the AMA you provided anecdotal examples, like your own personal experience form conferences, a personal feeling that awareness is growing,.. but as a stakeholder I'd like to see something more tangible and numerical... what metric do you think would be relevant, if any? Pageviews on decred.org? Google Trends? Exchange rate?\n\nOr perhaps that is outside the scope of Ditto, should we direct those questions more at the marketing (Dustorf?) instead?\n\nIf awareness is growing, surely there must be some kind of measurable effect, that awareness cannot just exist in a vacuum, it needs to result in some kind of action: either Googling about it, or downloading the client, or buying the coin...? The metrics that are accessible to me do not show any significant boost in awareness, so all that remains is the anecdotal \u0026 feeling that it is growing, but how can stakeholders assess that? \n\nBecause like you say, DCR is often not even mentioned in many articles about crypto governance, which is very strange since we should dominate this conversation, as you rightfully state. I certainly don't blame Ditto for that, but awareness obviously hasn't grown **that** much?\n\nI'm aware Rome wasn't built in a day, but as a voting entity I need to try to find the weak/critical points, the good things speak for themselves anyway. \n\nYou write:\n\n\u003e Now that it has broader awareness, \n\nAs if this was already common knowledge agreed upon and established.\nBut what is the evidence for it? \n\n\u003eEmpower community\n\nYes, I especially like this part. There is potential there.\nI'm thinking DCR PR\u0026Marketing needs more out-of-the-box approaches, they have demonstrably worked in the past.\n\nGood luck \u0026 thank you!","signature":"b2d140657430e7723ef180d4a7bacc67c1c88c101d01ae922513447245b1d681f1dd5735de03f91d885f3f6093dd7605e587614bf2a8e93478d2b1b9efb25f06","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"65b59cefcd860872c19dd62089c09f895e0a49b5880db8fd37467be22604a7d8b0696a46982829c34100f4bb79101fd7bf7406c14b38aa1d0575da64098e9e06","timestamp":1559149292,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
