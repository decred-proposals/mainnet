How can we assess engagement, how effective those publications were? I know this is very tricky to quantify, but in this post you say:\n\n\u003e Decred’s awareness and visibility have significantly increased in the last six months, \n\n... as this was a fact, but how do you reckon? In the AMA you provided anecdotal examples, like your own personal experience form conferences, a personal feeling that awareness is growing,.. but as a stakeholder I'd like to see something more tangible and numerical... what metric do you think would be relevant, if any? Pageviews on decred.org? Google Trends? Exchange rate?\n\nOr perhaps that is outside the scope of Ditto, should we direct those questions more at the marketing (Dustorf?) instead?\n\nIf awareness is growing, surely there must be some kind of measurable effect, that awareness cannot just exist in a vacuum, it needs to result in some kind of action: either Googling about it, or downloading the client, or buying the coin...? The metrics that are accessible to me do not show any significant boost in awareness, so all that remains is the anecdotal \u0026 feeling that it is growing, but how can stakeholders assess that? \n\nBecause like you say, DCR is often not even mentioned in many articles about crypto governance, which is very strange since we should dominate this conversation, as you rightfully state. I certainly don't blame Ditto for that, but awareness obviously hasn't grown **that** much?\n\nI'm aware Rome wasn't built in a day, but as a voting entity I need to try to find the weak/critical points, the good things speak for themselves anyway. \n\nYou write:\n\n\u003e Now that it has broader awareness, \n\nAs if this was already common knowledge agreed upon and established.\nBut what is the evidence for it? \n\n\u003eEmpower community\n\nYes, I especially like this part. There is potential there.\nI'm thinking DCR PR\u0026Marketing needs more out-of-the-box approaches, they have demonstrably worked in the past.\n\nGood luck \u0026 thank you!","signature":"b2d140657430e7723ef180d4a7bacc67c1c88c101d01ae922513447245b1d681f1dd5735de03f91d885f3f6093dd7605e587614bf2a8e93478d2b1b9efb25f06","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"65b59cefcd860872c19dd62089c09f895e0a49b5880db8fd37467be22604a7d8b0696a46982829c34100f4bb79101fd7bf7406c14b38aa1d0575da64098e9e06","timestamp":1559149292,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We agree we should think about how to more closely measure success. Ditto spent the first 6 months proving ourselves, and we hope we’ve shown what we can do and that we deliver on our promises. In phase 1, we stuck to the basic metric of how many stories, bylines, and tier-one coverage we generated for Decred. Anecdotally, people tell us all the time that they’re seeing Decred everywhere. Just last week, a fund that’s also a future client approached us to take a position on Decred. We at Ditto are seeing it first-hand because we’re deep in the community everyday. We’ve also talked to community members like JZ and Jake, who say they’ve noticed an uptick in awareness at conferences and meetings.\n\nBut you’re right — that doesn’t tell the whole story. \n\nIn the first 6 months, an important metric for increased awareness was that Ditto has introduced 50+ of the leading crypto journalists to Decred. As the gatekeepers to the entire crypto community, journalists’ awareness carries immense, long-term weight, because in many cases their stories are people’s first touch point into Decred. When we first started talking to journalists at the end of 2018, the majority of them had never heard of Decred. Now, every single one of them is not only aware of Decred, but is well on the way towards associating it with staking and governance. The seeds have been planted, and we’re starting to see the results. \n\nAwareness is an important strategy in a bear market. Now, as things start to thaw and we prepare Decred to be in the best position possible during the bull run, what numbers should we be looking at?\n\nIn the next 6 months, there’s an opportunity to dive into more detail. Of all the metrics you mentioned, the most readily accessible is page views. Many of our clients have websites, home pages, or reports they want to drive traffic to. What are the priority web properties for Decred: Decred Journal? Decred.org? Medium page? In the proposal, we talk about creating more educational materials on the website, then getting those links placed in stories and driving traffic to those materials. One of the benefits to creating resources and making sure they’re socialized strategically is that we can measure clicks. The better and more sophisticated web presence we build, the more chances we’ll have to tie those to our PR efforts and measure web traffic. Ditto would need view access to Decred’s Google Analytics or other backend analytics so we can assess exactly how many people are clicking on backlinks in stories, which backlinks are most popular, which countries readers live in, etc. \n\nOther potential metrics include Twitter following, participation rates on Politeia, number of community members, number of contributors, etc. We’ve even talked about measuring awareness and sentiment at conferences. When people come to the Decred booth or approach a Decred rep, are there 3-4 questions we can ask to help us as we think about measurement and moving the needle on awareness/understanding of Decred? Metrics like these might be trickier because they’re affected by many variables besides just PR, but they could serve as long-term benchmarks. Ditto doesn’t have full visibility into all these metrics, so we would need the community’s help with gathering this information so we can measure our efforts against it over time.","signature":"1eb7302e27e230f446a2280361622856f12a92c8977eb4d7c3168d419c79de88cea5206d34ea0ced407eda3bc5eac1924e048165ef568afdd501ab6b2aa8f304","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"2","receipt":"b37ccc5d6d64344ce40d7aeb96eac8ee67ba0b926f991a25320d0d1399644feb36079fa4340bc42438778497c966efa647683c9758899a96039100b2b046c000","timestamp":1559153885,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This general lack of visibility into Ditto's efforts does require a lot of trust from the community however. I would echo others comments about picking a few meaningful metrics to report on, and also ask if there's any info you can provide re: resource allocation. Ditto is a small (if growing) PR firm it appears, and presumably has other clients. It is also presumably pursuing other business in parallel with this proposal (I would hope so). These other clients will naturally compete for Ditto's internal resources, causing variations in how much the $25k/mo goes to Decred initiatives.

Ditto is all about fewer accounts and more attention. At other PR firms, you could be on up to 12 accounts, many of them on your own! We do the opposite, which is why people call us the anti-PR agency. At Ditto, every account has a team. And each staffer is on no more than 4 accounts. Additionally, Trey tends to overstaff at Ditto, meaning we are staffed up for where the company will be in 3, 6, 9 months. Other PR firms tend to spread everyone thin and then desperately hire up when they get a new client. Not us! This means we are very available for Decred. \n\nDecred is one of Ditto’s most important clients (if not our most important client) because we truly believe in the long-term vision of the project. Talk to any one of us who work on Decred, and you’ll immediately see why that approach works and just how ingrained we’ve become. \n\nThat’s why we’re intentionally dedicating some of Ditto’s most experienced senior talent to this account: Trey, our CEO, has been heavily involved in Decred since we started working together. It’s rare for CEOs to be involved in day-to-day client work, but Decred has been an exception from day one. Leslie is a former Forbes journalist who has written about Decred in the past, has deep knowledge of the crypto space, and specifically came to Ditto to focus on working with Decred and other crypto projects. Margaret has years of PR experience running the gamut from big tech to tech startups — and she’s become very integrated into the community. Lastly, I (Liz) am in charge of our San Francisco office, where I’m 100% focused on crypto — primarily Decred (here’s some proof: https://twitter.com/liz_bagot/status/1131305762544705536). \n\nI hope we’ve proven through our constant engagement in Matrix, AMAs, and interaction across various platforms, that we are available to the community 24/7. I think our results speak to that availability.","signature":"aeb2594aee77a595d5ff135f189f6d5da65bc9d764829923caf1fa2fb223bf062e9b287a59205a37e6c22bf5efae7b749df614865331153be1057a84e42cae06","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"19","receipt":"3fe8bbbc41a3d32867adff7edb2e947ee6f800e9a42a95daed7276aea786584233684e36eac5c4a240ee5682e78da176a13d8717a03349ce48e091693c4d7202","timestamp":1559252242,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Trey and I had a ton of fun doing it and we will definitely be doing them more in the future. Fun fact: Trey’s online right now helping me answer these questions. \n\nIt’s important to point out that what we do is far more than just media relations. We are writing content, doing messaging, media training, events — an interdependent web of activities that create an ecosystem of broad awareness. And we keep the community updated on our work. Media coverage is easily measurable and visible, though, so we understand comments like this. And the good news is that the additional work we’re proposing is measurable and visible, too.\n\nLet’s hold onto those bonus incentives! It’s not something we normally do, but it’s an interesting idea. Maybe we see how the next 3-6 months go first and revisit. We like where your thinking is at, though. \n\nAbsolutely keep a close eye on us! We like being held accountable… and being recognized when we deliver. I think you’re going to see even more amazingness from Ditto as we see a bull run coming. This is an awesome time to be working with Decred, and it’s an important time to have a PR firm that’s keeping you out there in front of your target audiences. \n\nYou make a good point about creating a master list of media outlets we want to target. We’re glad to draw up a list and workshop it with the community, although it’ll probably be closer to 50-75 outlets, since there aren’t 100+ that cover crypto. We’ve had lots of discussions with various community members about target outlets, but we know priorities can change, and we’re happy to work off a master list that we can check off as we go. We’ve already hit important targets like WSJ, Forbes, The Block, Cheddar, etc. — lots of top tier that we didn’t expect to hit in the first 6 months. The next bull run will help us check off more on the list as outlets start covering crypto with more frequency and enthusiasm.","signature":"84031def4f2db9fccd9ca4148333facdd9beafd3b0a5d7d886c357b3763aaa32a09b4fe07a28c3bba7ffa6c08041766ac04cb25ff2d41f0c127d4e15c12c9f0a","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"20","receipt":"b74a6872d9d6e3c06bfa0f76fe628855dca9f0ad64c7ed6f032512d0db1105ca8376e476de0f9ea2d053186f398dc04faf2d470ceabc1b40d947d3ecebaac904","timestamp":1559256861,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

While I understand that Ditto is based out of the US, are there any plans to reach out to other partners/community members that reside overseas or are in non-english speaking countries? \n\nI love the idea of aggregating educational materials to one place, but could it be possible to extend that initiative to also include translation of that documentation in a few common languages?\n\nThis is not a problem unique to Ditto or Decred, multiple projects struggle with this. However, I think clear initiatives to create a more **global** community would be incredibly meaningful for the project. For instance, as voting is so critical to the ecosystem it seems logical to have both proposals and documentation in multiple languages. This may be beyond the scope of Ditto, but you all could \"start the conversation\". \n\nAgain, I really enjoy and appreciate the hard work Ditto is doing - just some food for thought!","signature":"45a77706a453586f019c2dc8c9d59db7cc62267d1445935d39a7a1ac8a9ef5f8ae5c659d81013850681d9fbf869dcd24ecc3dd3c18bebe8d1ef2f141c9fc3305","publickey":"7eddbbb108c8d2fb5ae9e27a2eb81ae9c1c2fef80d5d6ff47e56b91e1421bbdf","commentid":"23","receipt":"f3522d4282ec38a451301c51f6cd018135aaeeab5ba4a685faa8de3a1b2e05e73eb76b09c3f14fd1cb3131d464382763ff781d5f141b23f644d2be6d5ae90e0b","timestamp":1559303726,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As we fit the various pieces in place, the English language marketing is improving substantially, and this process is portable to marketing work in other jurisdictions.\n\nIt has been said that \"you go to war with the army you have\", and that is precisely what Decred is doing: using its US-based assets to increase English-language awareness about the project.  We have less assets in other jurisdictions, but we are beginning to more effectively deploy them and get results.  There is a certain amount of critical mass required to make an effective marketing push in each jurisdiction, e.g. several people who are fluent in both English and the local language that can attend events and increase awareness within their locale.  We are starting to reach critical mass for Spanish and Mandarin communities, so you can expect to see more on these fronts in the near future.","signature":"dbfcd88eba2b9ccf714c2d74744cea7994b702f6f42f7f14bfa5441316f61b71a82163e6d08bf16dfbda372744cbef44d5aa4788517e7491f33e3415b4f9530d","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"24","receipt":"f3ab8569e98720d7692f4941dca2e4dfa65fdd919e2ec138dd3b6eb3b7ba17096fb1c6c7bbbe5c96b7dffa2a21bdf3db44474881dfc4efb72c67ab12d821440b","timestamp":1559311929,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So, i'll probably be voting for this proposal.\n\n[Go Ditto.](https://i.imgur.com/pYqxO9r.png)\n\nBut I do have a few accountability questions:\n\nHow many Decred contractors received talking points, messaging or other consultation help from Ditto?\n\nCould these contractors please voluntarily let us know there thoughts on their experience with Ditto.\n\nHow many Decred contractors received Media and messaging training?\n\n\nCould these contractors please voluntarily let us know there thoughts on their experience with Ditto.\n\n\nIs Ditto aware of the complications surrounding the SEC's recent guiding Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets, and fallout with the geo-fencing of Decred by Poloniex. If not, please keep this on your radar, as it may become more and more relevant. Please include it as a part of your crisis communications...I believe the implications are much more serious then what has been mentioned thus far.\n\nI think there will be much more on this in the coming months ahead.

I will let them speak up if they want. I can say with 100% certainty it was helpful and valuable. It was also great to watch anyone from Jake to JZ think about how to conduct a good interview and get better each time with regular guidance from us. \n\nAs we mentioned in the proposal, we want to empower _anyone_ in the community with an interest in advocating for Decred to the media. There’s so much power in the community’s collective intelligence — now we just need to harness it and organize it by equipping people with the messaging and knowhow they need to engage in a public setting.\n\nYes, we’re aware of the Poloniex delisting and have been discussing it with the community over the past couple weeks. There will inevitably be some bumps in the road as the regulatory environment becomes clearer and crypto winter thaws, and we’ll keep in close contact with the community on how to respond to cases like this.","signature":"a0f7c29115647b71660e7bd92cefbff64fac4f8170fd469becd2832f10631177c6861f53392e3ed952bd5e41dd384b5ee7c0d4f8c112e8e2b2b9b030ffbe4908","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"29","receipt":"d2f0af99e3060036e4d12cb954a0d51db0481104da7098963bf42b856f059c3b6ee6678b241abfc507837c739b3c89a77f2986ddf168afaa528321600465880f","timestamp":1559345455,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
