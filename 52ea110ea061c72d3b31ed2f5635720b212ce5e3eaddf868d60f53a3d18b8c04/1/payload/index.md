Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred: Phase 2

**What**

[Ditto](https://www.dittopr.co/) is proposing a communications campaign that builds upon the success of our past six months, deepens and expands awareness of Decred, and positions Decred as the preeminent leader in important issues like staking and governance.

Much of what we do will build off of the work we did in the [previous proposal that passed in November 2018](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50): actively working with the community, developing targeted messaging and content, securing strategic media coverage, and providing event support. But now that we’ve built such a strong foundation, we want to take our work to the next level to cement Decred’s position as a top project.

At a high level, your target audiences should be more informed about and actively interested in Decred. Additionally, the Decred community needs to be organized and activated in a way where its presence is much greater online. 

As you will see below, this will entail:

* Building out and refining positioning, messaging, and talking points
* Developing a repository of educational materials and third-party content
* Educating and empowering the community to advocate on behalf of Decred 
* Conducting media outreach to support the efforts and developments of the Decred project
* Coordinating events and scheduling on-site interviews for Decred spokespeople

And who are we targeting with this approach? We believe these are your target audiences:

* Reporters: Every time they write about issues like governance and staking, they need to be talking to Decred or — at a minimum — instinctively knowing to mention you.
* Crypto community: From newbies to amateur hodlers to Bitcoin maximalists, the community needs to best understand what Decred is and why they should be involved, i.e. buy Decred. 
* Curious consumers: As we prepare for the next bull run, when the next wave of people get off the sidelines, we want Decred top of mind.
* Developers: From devs working at big tech and looking for a crypto side project to devs working on other projects, we want smart — but trusted — devs to come build on Decred.
* Institutional investors: From VCs to funds to big retail, investors need to better understand the value of hodling Decred and make it a part of their portfolio.  

We are happy to answer any questions in response to the community’s feedback.

**Recap of the Last 6 Months**

Ditto is proud of what we’ve achieved together with the community in the past six months. For an in-depth overview of our outputs, you can view the [livestream AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8XjAOMX-VM) with CEO Trey Ditto and Vice President Liz Bagot. Here is a summary of top results:

* A [foundational messaging document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jw9S8h6RYMMRXzJG8qWEVN9om5kmYIfNyNeUYbZ2ORk/edit?usp=sharing) breaking down Decred’s value proposition into understandable language for its target audiences. This messaging is and will continue to be a cornerstone for educating journalists, conducting interviews, and drafting marketing content. 
* 6 feature stories, 20+ media placements, and 18 interviews across various outlets, from mainstream business to crypto to finance. Highlights include an overview of Decred’s governance in [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gerons-take-decred-aims-to-reach-cryptos-decentralized-ideals-11552523191), a deep dive into the DEX proposal in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leslieankney/2019/02/04/no-more-trading-or-listing-fees-decred-releases-new-dex-proposal/) (written by Leslie Ankney, who has since joined Ditto as an employee working on Decred), a technical exploration of Decred’s governance in [The Block](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/03/20/decred-an-experiment-in-on-chain-governance/), and a retrospective on Decred’s third anniversary in [BREAKERMAG](https://breakermag.com/as-decred-turns-three-its-still-set-on-real-decentralization/). 
* 4 published bylines/op-eds, including in Hacker Noon and InvestInBlockchain.com.
* Media and messaging training for 6+ Decred community membership, resulting in a strong bench of voices who can speak to various aspects of the project. 
* Input on strategy, marketing plan, and social media, including a six-month PR strategy, investor outreach plan, 24/7 on-demand strategic counsel, and ongoing recommendations for social media engagement. 
* Staffing and coordination of speaking engagements at the North American Bitcoin Conference, New York Blockchain Week, OKCoin-Decred listing event, 10th anniversary Bitcoin event in NYC, Decred SF Meetup, and Atomic Swap (the event Ditto and The Block hosted during NYBW). Ditto directed reporters at these events to Decred for education. 
* Monthly contributions to the Decred Journal. 

These are external outputs that everyone in the community can see, but we also did extensive work internally that is invaluable:

* Educated 50+ reporters on Decred, planting the seeds for future, meaningful coverage. 
* Iterated drafts of content and messaging with the community’s input, including infographics, bylines, the Decred Journal, Decred Assembly, etc. 
* Sourced commentary from the community on breaking news of the day to get Decred in front of journalists even when it did not have any hard news.
* Advised the community on how best to amplify media coverage across social media. 
* Supported the marketing team by providing input on marketing and events plans. 
* Became closely integrated with the community by engaging on a daily basis both in-person and online: at meetups and on Reddit, Twitter, Matrix/Riot, etc. Provided strategic communications counsel to any community member who requested it.

**Why**

Decred’s awareness and visibility have significantly increased in the last six months, and we want to build on that momentum to activate its broad target audiences: devs, institutional investors, and crypto enthusiasts. Each of these audiences needs adequate knowledge and education to participate in Decred when the new bull market arrives. That requires going one level deeper into Decred’s differentiators: staking, governance, contractor model, privacy, etc.

We believe Decred would benefit from a continued partnership with Ditto for two reasons: 
* **We have scratched the surface but laid the foundation**. Now that it has broader awareness, Decred needs to focus on differentiating itself from other protocols, projects, and cryptocurrencies, ranging from governance projects to staking companies. We believe Decred should be the first project that comes to mind when governance and staking are mentioned everywhere from a VC’s office to a reporter’s story to Crypto Twitter. That will require us to be much more focused, aggressive and tenacious. 
* **Ditto has proven itself a dedicated and trustworthy partner to Decred.** We have a deep understanding of both Decred and governance. But we also understand the broader ecosystem and have worked on issues surrounding scalability and mainstream adoption. We have shown that we can give guidance and counsel on a regular basis, and most critically, we have shown that we can deliver impactful results.

**How**

***1. Build out and refine positioning, messaging, and talking points***
 
As our foundational messaging platform proved, what you say about Decred and how you say it makes a difference. The next phase is to continue to build out and refine the messaging to be able to:

* Clearly explain Decred to all audiences in their own language
* Differentiate Decred from other projects
* Engage audiences on issues relevant to Decred

As you will see below, this messaging will be the bedrock for almost everything we — Ditto and the Decred community — do. And it will lead to even more awareness. 

Ditto will work with the community to identify topics where we need to dive deeper, as we did with the ticket messaging. Some areas include: Flexible contractor model, store of value, and privacy. We would solicit community input, develop a draft for review, present it to the community (writers channel) via Github, and then collaborate to finalize and approve. 

***2. Conduct media outreach to support the efforts and developments of the Decred project***

Ditto has generated a lot of great media coverage for and developed strong journalist relationships on behalf of Decred. We will continue to generate a steady stream of media coverage in phase two, with a few updates: 

* Identify and prioritize tier-one media outlets that have not covered Decred yet: CNBC, Unconfirmed/Unchained, Bloomberg, TechCrunch, Mashable, and Fortune are a few examples.
* Develop a differentiated media strategy for each target audience, including unique storylines and media outlets for each (i.e. financial outlets for institutional investors, tech outlets for devs, and crypto trades for crypto enthusiasts).
* Brainstorm and establish new, broad storylines based on our refreshed messaging and educational materials. We will continue to support Decred announcements and will pitch breaking news commentary and relevant expertise. For instance, Decred should be mentioned in every story relating to staking and governance.

***3. Coordinate events and schedule on-site interviews for Decred spokespeople***

Over the past six months, conferences and events have been an important component to our communications strategy. These in-person interactions are one of the most effective ways to recruit developers and interact with institutional investors. 

We will continue to help coordinate Decred meetups in the same vein as the SF Meetup and investor conferences like the OKCoin listing event. From Consensus to the meetups to our own events like Atomic Swap (which Ditto co-hosted with The Block), Ditto will continue to prominently position Decred at the most impactful conferences, where the best minds in crypto/blockchain are speaking. 

We will also continue to help position Decred on the right stages — giving you a platform to communicate key messages to targeted audiences. Decred should capitalize on the high level of interest in crypto by speaking at/attending both crypto conferences, as well as hacker-led developer conferences like Devcon and Black Hat. We will take care of the application process and vetting, making it a turnkey experience for Decred. 

For conferences and events, Ditto will work with organizers to secure media lists and conduct outreach in advance, when Decred is attending or presenting. We will facilitate one-on-one interviews and informal meetings to ensure the reporters attending these conferences can hear from and interact with Decred in-person. 

***4. Develop a repository of educational materials and third-party content***

Decred’s target audiences need to be better educated about Decred and issues relevant to it. And we believe education in the short term will crystalize who Decred is, attract a wider audience and prepare the project to be in an amazing position for the next bull market. And education in crypto has proven to be very important. Media companies like The Block produce regular content that is more educational than it is reporting, and companies like Messari are utilizing data to educate. 

The reality: Decred has a lot of high-quality educational content in various places across the Internet (e.g. github, the Decred website, Medium, Twitter, etc.), but it can be difficult for journalists, crypto enthusiasts, investors, or anyone interested in Decred to find that information. Additionally, we want to make sure that the content speaks to each of your target audiences in a way that resonates.

The idea: Through both creation and aggregation, Ditto wants to build a Decred Resources Repository. Potential pieces of content include: 

* **Decred Governance Manifesto**: a document that outlines the principles of the Decred system and process. We could produce a long version and a short one, and it could live in the Canon.
* **Infographics/visuals**: We have an infographic underway to describe staking, and propose one for the “Lifecycle of a Ticket (Stakey).” We could develop others to illustrate how certain processes within Decred work, such as decentralizing the Treasury or how the DEX operates.   
* **Visionary/Thought leadership bylines**: Similar to the staking byline that we recently drafted, we would work closely with the Decred community to identify other important topics (open source, self-funding, etc) and collaborate to write the pieces.
* **Case studies**: Write stories describing use cases of Decred; for example: https://votolegal.com.br, successful Politeia proposals (e.g., Ditto could describe our experience), or profiles of contractors, how they found Decred and are thriving. 
* **AMAs**: Identify and partner with influencers with whom we can team up to do more AMAs, like the one Jake did with r/cryptocurrency. 

Execution: Ditto will identify themes, topics, and categories that are relevant to Decred. This could range from staking to governance to ticketing to About Decred to privacy. For example, we’ve already worked with the community to draft Ticket Messaging, and would like to create an infographic “Lifecycle of a Ticket/Stakey” to accompany it. This would live on the Decred website, and be shared with reporters, etc. who need a clear, concise understanding of Decred’s ticket-voting system. 

We will identify and aggregate all existing content and see what needs to be updated, refreshed, etc. 

Ditto will propose new content creation for Decred and what medium will be best (e.g. video, infographic, blog post, etc.). 

Finally, Ditto will work closely with the Decred community to decide how the content will be created. Can someone in the community do it, does Ditto need to help with the language, or should Ditto do it on their own? 

As you will read in the next section, once we have established a solid foundation of educational materials, we can build proactive campaigns around each topic (e.g. staking) to create an echo effect across media outlets and social media. These campaigns would entail activating the community to participate on social media, getting the media to write a story, and/or drafting byline/op-ed content that gets published in a third-party outlet. Working in concert, the entire crypto community will notice Decred’s increased presence. 

***5. Educate and empower the community to advocate for Decred*** 

*Online Activation*

Decred has a highly engaged and vibrant community, and we need to harness the power of the community to take online awareness of Decred to the next level. As it currently stands, there is no real coordinated effort amongst the community to increase awareness of Decred on platforms like Reddit and Twitter in a way that’s educational and impactful. 

In the short term, Ditto wants to help empower individuals at Decred to me more vocal online. In the long term, once the educational materials are finished, Ditto wants to create processes and campaigns where the community is active online in a way that better educates its target audiences on the project. 

Ditto will remain closely integrated with Decred’s community to provide the necessary input and counsel on how to leverage social media and PR to amplify Decred’s key messaging and participate in relevant conversations. 

We will: 

* Identify who the investor and dev influencers are on Crypto Twitter
* Identify opportunities for social media amplification
* Provide the foundational messaging the community needs to engage
* Offer best-in-class strategies on maximizing various social media platforms
* Recommend ways to align with Decred’s goals. 

*Traditional Media Relations*

One of the reasons Ditto’s first six months were so successful was having a pool of Decred spokespeople ranging from Marco and Luke to Murad and Jake to JZ. And Ditto was given very positive feedback about its media training program to put Decred spokespeople in the best position to give productive, positive interviews. We want to build on this by identifying and media training the next group of the Decred community.

We want to be more strategic with it this time, though, thinking about where people are located (domestic and international) and what topics they can — or should — talk to (staking, privacy, devs, etc.).
