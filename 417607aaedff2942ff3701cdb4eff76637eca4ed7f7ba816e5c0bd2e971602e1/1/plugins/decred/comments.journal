There are notable similarities, but also major differences, between Sparkswap and the Decred DEX (dcrdex). Here is how they compare, in my understanding:\n\nSparkswap has a dedicated wallet that must be funded for each asset.  Any wallet that you fully control may be used with dcrdex.\n\nWith Sparkswap, atomic swaps are done on the Lighting Network (LN), not the assets' blockchains. The initial implementation of the dcrdex will involve atomic swaps on the mainnet blockchain of each asset, but that need not be the case in the future.\n\nTo place orders with Sparkswap, funds must be \"committed\", which is done by opening LN channel.  With dcrdex, users merely identify UTXOs with sufficient value to fund the swap(s) that would be needed to fully fill and order, and sign the order with their account private key.\n\n**The Sparkswap \"Relayer\" is analogous to the Decred DEX server process.  It is operated by Sparkswap (the company), while the dcrdex may be run by anyone.  The Relayer does not appear to be open source, except for the Relayer's gRPC proto definition for clients.**  Perhaps I have just been unable to locate the Relayer source.  Please correct me if this is incorrect.\n\nThe Sparkswap \"Broker\" is the client, and may be run by the user, but a Broker seems to be able to serve multiple users. A Broker can accept many types of orders, including market orders, but the Broker turns them into one of two specific types of limit orders: new limit orders for the book, and fills/taking orders.\n\n**The Sparkswap Relayer does NOT perform order matching; the Brokers do this.  As such, there are no guarantees that users' orders are matched fairly.**  The dcrdex server has an independently verifiable epoch based pseudo-random order matching to ensure fair trading and combat a number of abuses and gaming of or by the exchange.  It is not clear to me how Sparkswap addresses order races coming from different Brokers.\n\nAlso like the Decred DEX, makers and takers are required to remain connected otherwise their orders will be cancelled.\n\nThe Sparkswap \"Relayer\" charges a 0.1% fee for placed orders and filled orders (0% during their beta period). The mechanics of capturing the fee is unclear to me.  dcrdex has no trade fees.\n\nOn Sparkswap, \"Trading Deposits\" for each order are used to disincentivize abuse, while dcrdex will use registration fee. Each order has a 0.1% deposit.  dcrdex requires no deposit for each order.\n\nFront-running seems to be mitigated in Sparkswap by only allowing limit orders on the Relay (market orders only exist conceptually on the Broker).  This leaves much to the Brokers who may operate in any way they like.\n\nSparkswap on spoofing: \"Spoofing by sending orders and cancelling quickly before someone takes the order is still possible -- this is common on all mature exchanges, and extremely difficult to enforce any prohibition against without harming overall efficiency of price discovery.\"  Although, spoofing by failing to execute an order that is filled is disincentivized on Swarkswap by the loss of the order deposit.  The Decred DEX penalizes frequent cancels following a cancellation metric, and similarly penalizes failure to perform the swap with loss of registration fee.\n\n\"Painting the tape\", or colluding parties creating a false appearance of a certain price, is disincentivized on Sparkswap with trade fees.  On dcrdex, epoch based pseudo-random order matching makes this risky to attempt.\n\n**Order suppression by the Sparkswap Relayer is not prevented.** The dcrdex requires that orders be broadcast to all clients, and eventually to all servers once server mesh operation is implemented.","signature":"0f040c8aeff69ec5a8a5e4e8b01908aa0a0805169cad2f41b01d2b333694128e0b6bbb53c551dbd07986ae8531e42a8099badbd6cc6a300b1b90a00f76c7cb08","publickey":"22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","commentid":"4","receipt":"f40b10c001ac4defb19f78e237ed1d7ffd35a59305a21a92f04501a43909edead4ef13977f022e3b7db76ba88d9ecd52418b890dd9f567552e848c7b6cf09e05","timestamp":1565213149,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
