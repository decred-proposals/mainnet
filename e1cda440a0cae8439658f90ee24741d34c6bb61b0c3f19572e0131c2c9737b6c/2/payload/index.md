Moderation 2021

## Summary

This proposal seeks to renew funding for moderating Decred's main communication platforms (Matrix, Politeia, Discord, Telegram) until the end of 2021. The budget remains at $800-$1,500 per month, or $8,800-$16,500 in total over 11 months.

Moderation is defined as "filtering content". That involves evaluating content, removing abusive content, and taking measures to prevent it in the future.

I omitted most things that have not changed since the first [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/32cba00) to save reading time. Please check it out for detailed motivation, what work is covered and not covered, budget design, risks, and discussion.

## Why

I believe that all useful work should be offered a reward, and moderation is useful work.

One great thing about Decred is that most comm channels are open and anyone can come and talk to contractors and key players. To protect this ability from abuse and keep the space efficient for contributors and stakeholders, we have a dedicated mod team available every day.

Formally approved budget makes this work more sustainable and allows to scale the capacity as needed.

## First proposal report

The first [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/32cba00) was approved in August 2020 to formalize funding for work already being done.

Overall these 6 months have been pretty calm with mainly routine removal of spam and handling a few problem users a week.

The most spam and scam attempts are coming from Telegram. The ratio of banned spam/scam/bot users to legit users is a pretty crazy 10:1, but we are lucky to have moderation bots written and operated by others that keep the place clean and require little manual work.

On Discord new users are verified manually, which trades some initial work for having less abuse in the future. Once in a while a bot spam attack requires a cleanup. Overall it has had minimal problems with bots/spammers, which is quite surprising in the bull season.

Matrix work has been mostly cleaning up the spam propagated across the bridge, and warning a few people to stay on topic.

On Politeia the main activity is reviewing proposals and comments, and the amount varies greatly by the month. The most busy one was August, with the following months requiring much less attention.

On Reddit we have [tweaked](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines/commits/master/reddit/rules.yml) some rules and introduced one to direct all support requests to #support chats in Telegram/Discord/Matrix, where users can connect with the devs to solve problems quickly.

YouTube needed a bit of spam cleanup recently, which is a good sign of growth, but it is too small to require funding at the moment.

One idea I had for reporting is to collect all mod activity and generate reports automatically. Some of it worked, but some didn't. We created a channel to collect activity in a special format and @degeri [automated](https://github.com/degeri/dcr_matrix_rss_bot) the Reddit part. The other platforms require logging by hand, so we only do it for notable actions like bans or content removal. Overall I think it is an improvement to have a log of mod activity across all platforms, but more automation is required to make it less tedious and error-prone.

Budget-wise, the monthly limit was $1,500 and the expected amount was $800. The limit was met with the average monthly spend of $600, or ~$3,600 for 6 months. It was lower than expected because the load was not high and some people did not bill for some work. The table below compares estimated and actual average monthly spend for each platform:

platform | limit  | expected | ~actual
---------|-------:|---------:|--------:
Discord  |   $300 |     $240 |    $220
Matrix   |   $240 |     $120 |      $0
Politeia |   $600 |     $300 |    $255
Telegram |   $200 |     $120 |     $30
reserve  |   $160 |          |     $95
1 month  | $1,500 |     $780 |    $600

The reserve was mainly used for setting up the common modlog and automating its Reddit part.

## Plan for 2021

The plan is to continue doing what was outlined in the first [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/32cba00), improve, and adjust as necessary.

The list of platforms considered "most important" and covered by this proposal is the same: Matrix, Politeia, Discord, and Telegram. The latter two are not used to coordinate work or decision making, but are included for their high potential to onboard new users.

## Who

Everyone included in this proposal is serving as a moderator for many months or years and is a well known community member. A full list of active mods is provided below for reference, but some work as volunteers without billing, reducing the overall cost.

- bee: Reddit
- degeri: Matrix, Reddit
- Exitus: Discord, Telegram, YouTube
- jz: Matrix, Discord, Telegram, Reddit
- jy-p: Matrix, Politeia
- richardred: Politeia

Additional mods may be recruited as needed.

Reddit is not covered by this proposal because it would go [against](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxxd9s/moderation_of_decred_communications_politeia/fza44fs/) their [user agreement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement), but its mods are listed here for informative purposes.

**Continuity plan**

My role as a proposal owner will be to watch that billing is reasonable, write a report at the end of the term, and submit a renewal proposal. In the event I am unable to do so due to unforeseen circumstances, @degeri and @richardred have kindly agreed to pick up this role. Other options will be to shut down the proposal or have an all-contractor vote so that someone can take over until the renewal.

## Budget

The montly limit for all activities will remain at **$1,500**, with the expected amount of **$800**. For 11 months of 2021 this translates to $16,500 limit and $8,800 expected.

platform   | limit  | expected
-----------|-------:|---------:
Discord    |   $250 |     $210
Matrix     |   $350 |     $150
Politeia   |   $600 |     $300
Telegram   |   $100 |      $50
reserve    |   $200 |      $90
total 1 mo | $1,500 |     $800

Some of the contributors listed in these roles do not bill for their work, and so the projected budgets are lower in areas where more of the moderators are volunteers.

The only hard limit is the monthly limit. Per-platform limits are "soft" to remain flexible in case one needs more attention than the others.

The reserve will cover spikes of activity beyond per-platform estimates, tooling and process improvements, and management overhead.

Any unused funds will remain in the Treasury.

## Duration

This proposal covers 11 months between February 1 and December 31, 2021 (January was covered by the first proposal).

A report will be published at the end of the term.

## Voting soon

I plan to authorize voting soon to know the result before Feb invoices are paid. Please post any questions or feedback you might have. Apologies for the shorter discussion period.
