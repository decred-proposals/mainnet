I am also a huge fan of this iteration of **Sound Money for Sovereign Individuals**  to the extent that I favour it greatly over the alternative Stakeholder Governed Sound Money. The DAO focus + revised headline has my support. I appreciate retaining the **Sound Money** component as I still believe this is ultimately encompassing of many core features and values of Decred and I believe will become increasingly prevalent in the public discussion as global macro continues to play out around us.\n\nHow do you envision the construction of the Tagline components (noting we should have the rule of 3)?. We have:\n- Secure (What)\n- Adaptable (How)\n- Sustainable (How)\n- Fair (Why)\n- DAO (How)\n- Sovereignty (Why + How)\n\nDoes this RFP propose to maintain/modify the text for \"Fair\" section proposed by the original iteration and/or include additional or revised copy to discuss the DAO and make it more central? I think this is a worthwhile consideration as bringing the DAO explicitly to the forefront feels like the right approach.\n\nEither way, glad to see this iteration and I like the direction.","signature":"6abef2c13c9f70ce735294f0513ec1ec10c2ff3f81c6639ce8434f033b7caecf2d0087f1b96beff041899de3db8c8ea0f9c00484255af25f75353d25a7bd7a0f","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"04572d418a10e0fdbbc4aab57436121727e49dbb71695bf56c320cc05b7640319ee667580cd17c8222c0cd728e17a01cc8dcdc0b67015f850752186a3a00e60f","timestamp":1601095284,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
