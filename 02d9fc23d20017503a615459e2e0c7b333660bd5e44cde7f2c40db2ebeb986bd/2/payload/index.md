Decred: the evolution of money

There is a [new RFP](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/91becea) that invites the Decred community to submit ideas around Decred's messaging. 

This proposal aims to change as little as possible on the main website, but aims to unify the way we tell Decred's story to the world.

## Thinking through messaging

In narrative development there are typically four key stages: 

    Insight - the big picture, what is the context to the story you are telling?

    Problem - within the context you have framed, what is the primary issue?

    Solution - what is the compelling answer to the problem and context you have set?

    How it works - explain how the solution works, from high level to deep dive.

This approach gives structure to storytelling.

Let's check Decred's messaging on the current website against this structure.

    Insight - ?

    Problem - ?

    Solution - Introducing Decred: a community directed, superior store of value.

    How it works - It is secure. It is adaptable. It is sustainable. (+details)

Currently Decred's introduction misses two key steps - context and problem. For many in the community those steps may be self-evident, but for newcomers and for those less well versed in the history of Bitcoin (aka the vast majority of crypto) it is much harder to grasp the key stages of the story.

An example of Decred's implicit messaging:

    Insight - The existing financial system is inherently broken, blockchain technology can fix that

    Problem - BTC has failed to remain decentralized, it's still hard to reliably store and transact value

    Solution - Introducing Decred: a community-directed, superior store of value

    How it works - It is secure. It is adaptable. It is sustainable. (+details)

Technology can be world leading, but if the story doesn't connect, the tech alone won't matter. The reverse is also true: great storytelling will take you a long way, but if there aren't strong foundations to back up your claims, then trust will be shortlived. 

### Lessons to consider 

- The order of text really matters - prioritize. 
- Aim for reduction and simplicity to create impact. 
- Messaging is aimed at reaching and influencing - test it out. 
- Narratives and marketing approaches constantly change over time. 
- Multiple narratives may coexist, this is something we [see in Bitcoin](https://uncommoncore.co/visions-of-bitcoin-how-major-bitcoin-narratives-changed-over-time/) as well.

#### Key questions 

*What is the core insight at the heart of the message? *

*Which audience is the narrative aimed at and why? *

## Exploring alternatives 

Institutional investors such as [Blockhead Capital](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis) and [Placeholder](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2018/5/12/decred-investment-thesis) (among others) have outlined their DCR investment theses and community members have offered [alternative narrative paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hg2a9k/forward_thinking_friday_decred_narratives_26_june/). All these different ways of explaining Decred are relevant for this RFP.

It seems that there are [4 narrative categories](https://github.com/decredcommunity/pr/issues/6), each with a different target audience: 

1. cypherpunk, privacy, security, autonomy, freedom, decentralization 
2. number go up, sound money, 21M max, store of value, profit, rewards
3. infrastructure, open source, reliable software, quality development 
4. relatable stories, inspiration, positivity, celebrities, adoption

Remember: multiple different narratives can coexist. However, we will be **more powerful** when we create one overarching message that unifies the community. Good stories contain words and concepts that everyone can relate to.

### Possible new messaging 

The core insight, to me, is that we live in disruptive times. All over the world we have seen protests, pandemics, rising unemployment, unprecedented money printing, and we are slowly witnessing a disintegration of our "normal" lifestyle. 

We don't know how the world will change in the future, but it doesn't look pretty. 

Let's explore this narrative:

    Insights - We live in disruptive times. We can no longer rely on old systems to preserve our wealth and freedom

    Problem - online collaboration to generate and preserve wealth is difficult, especially with random strangers

    Solution - introducing Decred, a DAO that was created to build a better financial future for our children 

    How it works - Decred is creating the evolution of money:
    * instead of coins or cash we use decentralized credits (DCR)
    * you can choose to stake DCR to participate in governance and earn rewards
    * together, we make sure the project remains Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable

Final narrative should be determined in collaboration with the wider community.

We live in disruptive times. 

All around the world we see protests, pandemics, rising unemployment and massive money printing.

Our future on this planet is uncertain. To create a better future, we need to evolve money.

The evolution of money requires global collaboration. This is why we need Decred.

Decred is a decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO). We develop crypto technology for the public benefit.

Useful applications created by Decred include: Atomic Swaps, DEX, Politeia, the Lightning Network.

Instead of coins or cash we use DCR (decentralized credits), a modernized version of money.

Everyone can stake DCR to vote on major decisions and earn rewards. 

Together we make sure that the project is Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable.

>BOXES 

Order of the boxes remains unchanged. This way the video still makes sense. We could edit the text on the sub-pages to include some of Richard Red's copy, for example about skin in the game or why governance matters.

> LATEST NEWS 

Remains unchanged.

> FOOTER 

Add telegram and weibo (for Chinese community)


## About me

My story: [noahpierau.github.io](https://noahpierau.github.io/)

Decred community member since day 0.

- I received the Decred airdrop and never sold a single credit from it.
- I worked with _ingsoc and jz to build Decred's community from the ground up. 
- I helped several valued contractors get started with working for Decred. 
- I represented the project on social media and during offline events.

## Estimated costs + help required from others

I aim to change as little of the existing website as possible, only on the homepage and in other strategic places such as copy in link previews and social media descriptions. I will co-create the new copy with the community. For free. 

The only costs go into design and implementation, to be done in collaboration with existing contractors. As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.

| Item           | Estimate | Maximum |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Design    | 200     | 350    |
| Translation    | 1100     | 1400    |
| Implementation | 200      | 350     |
| Total          | 1500     | 2100    |

This is the second version, feel free to add comments and suggestions!
