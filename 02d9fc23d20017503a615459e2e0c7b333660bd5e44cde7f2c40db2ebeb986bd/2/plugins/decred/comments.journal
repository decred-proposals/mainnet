I am also a huge fan of this iteration of **Sound Money for Sovereign Individuals**  to the extent that I favour it greatly over the alternative Stakeholder Governed Sound Money. The DAO focus + revised headline has my support. I appreciate retaining the **Sound Money** component as I still believe this is ultimately encompassing of many core features and values of Decred and I believe will become increasingly prevalent in the public discussion as global macro continues to play out around us.\n\nHow do you envision the construction of the Tagline components (noting we should have the rule of 3)?. We have:\n- Secure (What)\n- Adaptable (How)\n- Sustainable (How)\n- Fair (Why)\n- DAO (How)\n- Sovereignty (Why + How)\n\nDoes this RFP propose to maintain/modify the text for \"Fair\" section proposed by the original iteration and/or include additional or revised copy to discuss the DAO and make it more central? I think this is a worthwhile consideration as bringing the DAO explicitly to the forefront feels like the right approach.\n\nEither way, glad to see this iteration and I like the direction.","signature":"6abef2c13c9f70ce735294f0513ec1ec10c2ff3f81c6639ce8434f033b7caecf2d0087f1b96beff041899de3db8c8ea0f9c00484255af25f75353d25a7bd7a0f","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"04572d418a10e0fdbbc4aab57436121727e49dbb71695bf56c320cc05b7640319ee667580cd17c8222c0cd728e17a01cc8dcdc0b67015f850752186a3a00e60f","timestamp":1601095284,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Your suggestions make sense for a technical audience, but for the general population we need to keep it simple. Right now, the aim of this proposal is to keep the 3 boxes the same (so [our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjZwWD0pDzw) still makes sense) but to add an introduction that will hopefully resonate with a wide range of people:\n\n```\nWe live in disruptive times.\n\nAll around the world we see protests, pandemics, rising unemployment and massive money printing.\n\nOur future on this planet is uncertain. To create a better future, we need to evolve money.\n\nThe evolution of money requires global collaboration. This is why we need Decred.\n\nDecred is a decentralized, autonomous organization (DAO). We develop crypto technology for the public benefit.\n\nUseful applications created by Decred include: Atomic Swaps, DEX, Politeia, the Lightning Network.\n\nInstead of coins or cash we use DCR (decentralized credits), a modernized version of money.\n\nEveryone can stake DCR to vote on major decisions and earn rewards.\n\nTogether we make sure that the project is Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable.\n```\n\nWe agree that \"evolve per the will of stakeholders\" doesn't read well. Perhaps we could edit the text within the 3 boxes to make them more readable, but I think the titles should stay the same (so they match the video). We can also change the sub-pages to include some of your and Richard Red's copy, for example add \"built to last\" or \"skin in the game\" or why governance matters.","signature":"65c978f9079b522d76f59097a27d27d6c26e2ebd608a0fb79136cdb91b0b8936425b7d2470079f04d0fd8200ec09e583b47e0febbded29d7ec3b50bf47419906","publickey":"62bfae59f14200726edce2ad6e75d0e9190307b23442e99b0cba78a84fdad4c8","commentid":"7","receipt":"80a45127de426400fbc915901b7b8a78b63ebe8354c4fe6c9ab1c67fee854b20ba1a1b1ee8900c74b8bd57ee390f6153859ff2ebd3774553acba077470460908","timestamp":1602159981,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The second version of the proposal is now live, which specifies the suggested changes to the website. The third and final version of this proposal will be determined via a collaborative process with input from the Decred chats on Matrix, Discord and Telegram.","signature":"bccea3b690beb0f896e764f42615b02effb1218c04901b6c273b260f135f3c0579d055bead3c6dfebafbcc7f138f750315c5b2eeba446a5dcf9ff968517f5f0e","publickey":"62bfae59f14200726edce2ad6e75d0e9190307b23442e99b0cba78a84fdad4c8","commentid":"8","receipt":"fe7e1070ce0be0a31868a8e8c09097d3aee60eb03c42fdd4c8acf572aa339866ecf4f74a2eec9c92705c2b9f4de8fe59f38d47f77989a15f80491ef3e247b805","timestamp":1602161374,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The DAO narrative is something Decred was early to but we deemphasized by going for a sound money approach to directly compete with Bitcoin.\nWhile sound money is one aspect of the cache with Decred its only a small part of what Decred could be, a thriving market and ecosystem built on first principles and which strives for fairness and justice.\n\nNoah has is a long standing member of the community and has been instrumental in bringing many people into network through is writing and visibility on our social networks.\n\nI am nottrunner and I  endorse this proposal.","signature":"6c9a755c1f55cfa0c144787683b04ea648472db5eafbacab75c9ee0b89ab205143d92a106c28092e96746467e81b56186cc8bfd3467d34029adc5f8db186b40d","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"9","receipt":"2506687e78795c1ba24ae55e81837637a1ef796ac320c3802f5a74b2e237a482fe52846d3d5bd43952513700151e081f157ec6bc1a49bf3a6b58d87a4193c702","timestamp":1602531786,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
