Hour estimate numbers look fair, but how important are those milestones right now, compared to other tasks in the wider Decred project?\n\nI think I understood the motivation of the original TD proposal: facilitate integration of Decred in more wallets/websites/apps + expose Decred to Python devs. But what motivates the expansion of the original proposal with work outlined in this proposal? Is the main goal the same (to boost integrations) or is it switching to build a full alternative wallet?\n\nNotes:\n\n- \"dcrstakepool just added accountless ticket service too\": If you refer to PRs [514](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/514) and [515](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/515) they are not merged yet.\n- \"Medium tutorial\": I suggest posting it on GitHub as well. I don't trust Medium for not censoring crypto content. Plus you could get some contributions.\n\nQuestions/milestones:\n\n- \"Full node interoperability\": can you expand this just a little bit please, why 120 hours? Can RPC client be genrated from protobuf definitions or something like that?\n- \"Python SPV node\": can you estimate disk size usage for TD wallet in SPV mode? Context: dcrwallet disk footprint went from ~60 to ~350 MB with the support of block filters. I'd like it to use much less space and I was told it can be greatly optimized.\n- \"BTC wallet\": will it act as a client of a Bitcoin Core node, Electrum server or (ideally) using compact filters (BIP-157/158)?\n- By \"Decred DEX\" do you mean adding a GUI for [atomicswap](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap) or integrating with the higher level [dcrdex](https://github.com/decred/dcrdex)?\n\nQuestions/general:\n\n- Can you please give an overview of how TD fits into existing Decred software ecosystem, specifically what parts does it intend to reuse and what parts to reimplement?\n  - To what degree TD is building its own code vs reusing dcrd/dcrwallet via RPCs?\n  - Is it implementing a wallet in Python without using dcrwallet at all? If yes, what is the motivation do so and not just orchestrate dcrwallet like Decrediton does?\n  - Can [dcrlibwallet](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrlibwallet) or [godcr](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr) be reused in some way?\n- Wallet software protects my money and has higher requirements. What's your plan to make it reliable and something that people can trust? (like extensive test coverage, fuzzing, involving peer experts for an audit)\n- Has the time come to split the GUI into its own repo? ;)\n- These hour estimates, do they include \"backend\" work or also building the UIs in Qt?","signature":"d7799ce889728adef0201d5ca890ba3497a2b60674d924da733f296426eac48f4ca29540f32d71356e5761f25bce1d49af998adec84856811af72abb198ea30d","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"1","receipt":"f8d2253a4ba37f23b5a791182fd2068e4e8f8ce2aeb71b41a7a70eb6e5605ad9292957e854a203348f0695904ac201dcef94aabd1809c144288d48bbc6a1cb02","timestamp":1573833295,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
