Raedah and I have been talking about pointing it at some Raedah Group repos and doing some analysis actually. This is all on my own time however (not billed to the treasury), as one of the reasons the initial GitHub analysis work (funded by the first open source research proposal) was discontinued, was that some in the community had a strong negative reaction to the idea of dev metrics being applied to their work. I think there are some valid concerns there, and certainly plenty of horror stories about dev metrics being abused. I do think though that if done right it (i.e. customized for specific Decred repos and actually reflecting reality) SourceCred could be different and super valuable in a number of ways. And SourceCred is looking for crypto projects to partner with actually. If there was interest from the broader community, and some funding, would totally be down to explore that.","signature":"49f5bb0bdc2f9525c853259153038d187a9abc6d950c8f8a531c9172e88622cdf3a3e424982a9f517757a710b703e0ef08c8d1e643aea429b077b7920f0e7e07","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"5","receipt":"f1d136067438ce64966361cb875b2c2e5025c89f3d1bc6c138e45db9767c551061c7d33b2e812b7daba6d1b7f3637afcdf1197f67e9a979208645c1479a0dd0d","timestamp":1559455295,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
