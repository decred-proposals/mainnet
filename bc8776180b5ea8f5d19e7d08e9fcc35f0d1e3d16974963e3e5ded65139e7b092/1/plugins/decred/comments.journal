Can you provide some referral or contacts of other projects you have worked with so we can gather more feedbacks ? \n2.

May i suggest short period of trial stage, and after gathering more feedback from teams working with you guys we can slowly extend the period of commitment. \n4. \"Decred team\" was mentioned many times in the proposal. would you list a few (3-5) personnel from the \"Decred team\" and have you discussed the proposal personally with them?

My worry is that a firm with experience dealing with other cryptocurrencies in the space will find that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase. We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver. \n\n\u003e As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.\n\nI'd like to know Jake's thoughts on this. In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. I greatly trust and respect him, and I expect he will have significant influence in the project for the foreseeable future, but we're not here to make a cult of personality around him.\n\nOverall, this looks like a great pitch for promoting a company, but Decred is not a company. It's a decentralized cryptocurrency.\n\nAlso, from the diverse list of clients, it seems to indicate that Wachsman will promote nearly any project that has funding available. I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.\n\nIf we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months. Or is the current proposal cancelable at any time?\n\nDisclaimer: I tend to be a pessimist by nature, so my first reaction to any proposal is usually negative. I'm not 100% opposed; I want to keep an open mind.","signature":"a351616fb7cf93d5eb41011362dc4cd126f112d908eab71d3b294219b0271622a200d11c4b2830c6cf2658161ab1dba500b9715371d56c8acbceca6e977dcb04","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"4","receipt":"f9b3b9dda5405a025d1a3ddc6b48e6eb1334bfd71f756ee0db9997143694b60a16ad3c3f465706db1356fda15b85789b7c80bf6314a2ce2b645568ad31cbcd0f","timestamp":1540075014,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think Jake is a great ambassador for Decred. I have also seen JZ and Marco do great interviews. I am comfortable expanding the number of Decred personalities to include all three and so that we can deliver a consistent message.  \n\nWe have lots of very smart people in Decred, and several could/should be projected as thought leaders in the crypto space. One reason why I happen to like Decred is because we have more than one heavyweight personalities with strengths in certain areas. \n\nThe only issue that gave me pause on the proposal is the extensive list of crypto clients. Yes it's great they know crypto well. But clients include Dash and Horizen, which I might regard as competitors (even if I own some of the tokens on their client list). Would there be a conflict of interest? Probably not, but I want to raise the issue in case others can eliminate my doubts entirely or surface other concerns around that. \n\nThe cost of the proposal, given the international reach and apparent connections to media and event organizers, seems reasonable (and yes, I have worked with brand and marketing agencies in different areas of the globe). If we can negotiate further, I am all for that --- but let's give marketing some serious attention. \n\nI recognize that we wouldn't be here discussing this if it was not for the outstanding work of our developers and programmers. But well placed marketing is also important - and we must have presence with both retail crypto investors and institutional investors - globally. As our brand equity rises, so too will demand to hodl decred and participate in our governance system.","signature":"6591b8e8e79306102e35187989ea3c7545dc99e1035feddb56c51046a7101bf3c0467e87630ea31b7e43772cd289402f8d1afce0cb3f9cb163934e1493bec40e","publickey":"4ad431a4d546ed1cd631acaf08fa47e41f4e77c45b8057d3cf6ab516f6f284dd","commentid":"7","receipt":"4ef45c16f014cc6d60148885b7e4a861c38680df9ba8b1d6dc1a42f2e76e29ccad6d70eb5ce12c86f6e918d9e71beb069ec0c8a426d2207fca1ff7f44888c608","timestamp":1540084090,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Does anyone else get an eerie vibe from this in the sense that this proposal is essentially offering to sell us Decred's brand?\n\nI picked up on a lot of flashy \"marketing\" terms (no surprise there) and I'm always skeptical of marketing services in general. I would encourage others to also be skeptical of a marketing proposal offered by a marketing company (sorry Wachsman, but I know how marketing is). I do agree with the others who have suggested that Decred should have more general marketing services, but this proposal just comes off to me as an expensive \"brand in a box\" subscription service.\n\nA lot of the services offered are ones I doubt will even get used, and I don't think we need much assistance when it comes to event strategies - our current event group seems to be doing just fine.\n\nI don't think we need to pay for positive media. With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.","signature":"b571f306e3060049d0314fa840ff4e979ffb7ed4e38ebb76f8bb75a696f5f4f06ba55c3a53facaec939d2ec474824409d15235997f8ee34fb0bc65dca9a2ed04","publickey":"51a079b65d37ffa34a90ea52b92c60e818167eee597aee86b14200ce834fc5ba","commentid":"8","receipt":"08f06815ad7f35b4f58f7de0aab0e8c36d06a1816bc475c85feb8cdcbe6b9abbef6775311ad977eee3e35dceab32f6dd8f56c54b1cadfdf3b4f70a2343a6d30c","timestamp":1540087978,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Especially as Marco and Jake leveraging their cred and visibility in the crypto community. I think Decred could use a lot of help with media coverage. I've been obsessively researching crypto for a couple years. Just discovered Decred a couple months ago, and that was through a convert at a meetup. That Decred only got their first CoinDesk article a couple weeks ago is crazy. And connections with journalists are difficult and time-consuming to cultivate.  \n\nI think the best move could just be hiring them (or a similar agency) and paring back some services that aren't as needed to reduce the price?","signature":"dca4ce69e36baa978e1450ea6f14316cf8b086504e496f966462ec4b4da8ffa5464bcfb529465918bb3848a025b65b9f1ffbfbd0598aa605ca1de1055fcdd308","publickey":"5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","commentid":"11","receipt":"e42e8ac8e660253fcaed21b51b604c85da0d9948b517e7e3fb8bee68a6f06e8ef2509f91780587e79060f16d5b494d858266bd4e0caa05d8e02a692b12137107","timestamp":1540098266,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm wondering if Decred needs the full suite of services proposed. Decred seems to be doing well on their own with events, aided by the credibility Marco, Jake and Jz have in the crypto community. The more valuable things Wachsman could bring to the table are brand strategy and PR (getting journalists to write about you is hard, no matter how good your tech is). \n\nSource: my partner who runs her own successful demand generation agency, and who's been listening to me ramble about Decred for a while now.","signature":"b2b32a9f1b308bd1eadfdb7db79ca824ea3d6aa0dc4090dca0ce311d52f6fda7605ea69c19e803271e71dbd1ae76d3eff971a0bea47a3a9c6d37649f0ce3a604","publickey":"5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","commentid":"12","receipt":"1bc532cc98295babde18c6f30c95162e466087afd03287bdbfff6569985d202bf77c8024c41e97b35e02271d08ba7749fa82f6a15362645c375c0efc8cc6250e","timestamp":1540099879,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is not just about advertising, this proposal seems to focus a lot on communication, events and public speaking, which is a good idea in my opinion. \n\nCaution must be taken though not to make decred appear like a corporate for profit entity that spends a lot on marketing and tries to attract investors.  \nThat would not resonate well within the cryptocurrency community, but from the proposal it looks like the provider is well aware of the core values of decred. \n\nThe current branding (logo, stakey, graphics are very very good, clean and nicely designed and I would not change the branding at all. \n\nIf we have one very professional provider who is able to add significant value to decred, then I would support having one provider with a clear plan and structure as opposed to countless scattered marketing proposals. \n\nI have the impression that decred is not very present at conferences and relevant gatherings in Europe yet, not sure about Asia as well, so my hope would be to get the word out beyond the United States where many team members appear to be based.","signature":"9c5a5e8bac8910838569fbad9a305c3bc322869a7cc894569e647fd4437ad9c0d3c18579230ec1d596525202dc51f26318af46923d32a9a8bb57b9013d0d7103","publickey":"e1016f5f45877b4c4aa85d9f7beabbe2bafbdabe0269b213d4046dc5ed61689a","commentid":"13","receipt":"480c5f9d3715edc35049d176617c2bef229c1f4c19418d0c82c3cb12bc2cc03985960f8a2ad7e31dfbc36e3d98779ecaa1eb9bd183276b414f215c542bdf880b","timestamp":1540099939,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
