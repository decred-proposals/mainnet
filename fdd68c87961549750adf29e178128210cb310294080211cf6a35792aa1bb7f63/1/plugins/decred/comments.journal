As I see it there are a number of major issues which should be addressed.\n\n1. 70% of the budget being distributed upfront is deeply problematic. This would amount to around $22,000 being transferred to people who are largely unknown to the community, with little recourse in the eventuality that you do not deliver.\n1. The suitability of the local speakers to represent Decred is unknown, and the whole value proposition rests on this. To have any chance of success I think you would need to convince the stakeholders that these speakers would represent the project well.\n1. The proposal describes inviting at least one Decred representative from the US to one or two major events. It would be worth finding out if any Decred representatives are willing to attend these events.","signature":"34f94a2d13c8e929c5f6501cd4f1a76e38cb6342bc464cb7d7f2f7e8d620a5e4107ae3bf10c763007530e80d2b06d25db289424ac014bbc20a70ecc518710e09","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"d28cc19dae35645bf3281e9270b26a2dd4a7465ed97e65e0dc807158aed51bc7491dc330424362a222d0bf9b9a0f1c584403058ee6c3f1af35dc2b337d294d04","timestamp":1568144203,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As someone that worked with your team for the past year, I feel comfortable providing more details on your reliability, performance, and potential areas for growth.\n\nIn the past year, you showed a lot of interest and dedication to our project.  Spreading the word about the project, developers, staking capabilities, new features, privacy, and more. You introduced Decred Project to EXMO Exchange that currently offers DCR to fiat pairs. I feel very comfortable working you guys. Smart, Positive, and Responsive.\n\nOverall I love the idea of organizing events in major Easter European cities like Kiev, Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. Campaign details seem to cover everything necessary to host these events.\n\nPossible Improvements: my only recommendation would be to get involved more with the community, developers, and stakeholders. You can learn a lot from people that work for this project, and they will get the opportunity to work with your team.  (matrix, Reddit, Slack, twitter)\nYou could be a great asset in Easter Europe and work for Decred as a contractor.\n\nBelow is the list of things I'm concerned about or see as potential roadblocks:\n\n1. Four events to plan and organize. (a lot can go wrong with trying to host four events)\n2. An upfront deposit of 70%. I don't think stakeholders will go for this.\n3. Total budget: I think this area needs some work. Were you able to obtain quotes for spaces, to rent, traveling, etc. for all four cities? As a stakeholder, I'd like to have a bit more details.\n4. How many people are you going to deploy for logistics, etc.?\n\nHave you considered to organize a small local meetup in Kiev on your own and share the outcome with Decred Community? I think this can give you a lot of credibility and respect in the community. \n\nIs there a particular reason you'd like to do these four cities, instead of organizing an event in Kiev for example: see how it goes, and plan your next move accordingly?\n\nThank you guys.","signature":"4c7a867d09c57b2ff7a1a882cc3eb1aae0335f0e59fb30671645c31e4760ce4a2de3077e144ff3ff811243b79dd14c403038484e3ed78f545ee237d8cf53600f","publickey":"5a452f52d8cf2f66a84689107273f3b3b292307877ba6d92d01bb2dfebeee236","commentid":"4","receipt":"7a3426ccadece79381151d5273455869df8d31b143ae24fca4f333a3eca8538b25b200f2370bbd270ea2c691ea6123288750f7337a86fe2da7cfe620c0c1ec0d","timestamp":1568211595,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It is really important for us.\n\n 1) We thought out the preparation plan well enough, and there will be 2 months between each event, which will make it possible to make a good promo and attract attention of a large number of people\n\nIn addition, we made an analysis and took into account that other large events do not take place at this time, which gives us confidence in the correctness of our plan\n\nEach of the events will be a \"big happening\"  for the local crypto community, and we hope that this will create a stir and people will add visit of these events to their calendar in cities we've chosen\n\nIn addition, we consulted with the EXMO team which cities to choose and where most of their users are located, which of course will give a good impulse to the growth of Decred trading\n\n\n 2) We have already held similar events in these cities, so of course we have well calculated all the logistics, we have all the necessary contacts of local services (venue rental for the event, catering, banner manufacturers, etc.)\n\nOur team, serving an event, consists of: two cameramen, live broadcast director, manager/administrator, host of the event = total of 5 people\n\nIn our experience, a 3-day stay in each city for an event is required\n\nWe always come to the location the day before the event, check sound and Internet, set the light correctly and have a discussion with the administration of the venue, stipulating all the details - this allows us to eliminate all problems during the event\n\nEach of our events is designed for 100 people, the locations that we use can accommodate up to 300 people and if the number of pre-registered people is more than 100, then we can quickly increase the number of seats\n\nThe program of events and speaker's speeches are designed for 3 hours, with a coffee break\n\nThe venue is rented for 5 hours so that people can come in comfortably and without haste, register, leave their outerwear in the wardrobe (do not forget that it will be autumn and winter, when it is cold and snowing) and so they have time for networking in informal setting\n\nThus, the budget we are requesting in advance goes to rent and reservation of venues, catering, printing of large banners for photo zone, buying air tickets, booking hotels\n\nOur experience suggests that if you book and buy everything in advance, it will save a lot of money than if we would make payments one or two weeks before the event\n\nIn addition, please note that all of our costs associated with the creation of video content, will be received after all of the events\n\n 3) Our goal is to make Decred fast and efficiently enter the CIS market, which will make it possible to increase the number of Decred users in our region, and of course will increase the trading volume of Decred on EXMO\n\nWe plan to have 800-1,200 Russian-speaking Decred users after hosting all the events that install the wallets, will be added to the telegram chat and begin to build a community in our region\n\nIn each city, we plan to find a strong leader who will be inspired by the idea of ​​the Decred community and will help with its development, including hosting local meetups or participating in events organized by OKEx, Binance and EXMO exchanges in our region.\n\nTrading of Decred on EXMO can be done with Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia and Bitcoin, which is why, in order to give Decred popularity in the whole region at once and increase trading on EXMO for all pairs, we offer an integrated approach and a series of events","signature":"920919e7d1624bb899829157df201d032366c9398d348b40f2d1730c452842e48ed361d0d937e186186c1a23dfd669b8e7808452405e639a32db7c7f0f046b04","publickey":"184280b7c662fa1a8291335f2329bb7e49c606ecd6cdc9f52b637ee6de5b2856","commentid":"5","receipt":"195e88edd95e9774c40cf890a3c11b1131373e327588a266558c59adfcd2fd3827b15400a79b7034588a21a6e33ace102f0003308e4e5a200a5ca458a821640f","timestamp":1568230258,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
