As I see it there are a number of major issues which should be addressed.\n\n1. 70% of the budget being distributed upfront is deeply problematic. This would amount to around $22,000 being transferred to people who are largely unknown to the community, with little recourse in the eventuality that you do not deliver.\n1. The suitability of the local speakers to represent Decred is unknown, and the whole value proposition rests on this. To have any chance of success I think you would need to convince the stakeholders that these speakers would represent the project well.\n1. The proposal describes inviting at least one Decred representative from the US to one or two major events. It would be worth finding out if any Decred representatives are willing to attend these events.","signature":"34f94a2d13c8e929c5f6501cd4f1a76e38cb6342bc464cb7d7f2f7e8d620a5e4107ae3bf10c763007530e80d2b06d25db289424ac014bbc20a70ecc518710e09","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"d28cc19dae35645bf3281e9270b26a2dd4a7465ed97e65e0dc807158aed51bc7491dc330424362a222d0bf9b9a0f1c584403058ee6c3f1af35dc2b337d294d04","timestamp":1568144203,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As someone that worked with your team for the past year, I feel comfortable providing more details on your reliability, performance, and potential areas for growth.\n\nIn the past year, you showed a lot of interest and dedication to our project.  Spreading the word about the project, developers, staking capabilities, new features, privacy, and more. You introduced Decred Project to EXMO Exchange that currently offers DCR to fiat pairs. I feel very comfortable working you guys. Smart, Positive, and Responsive.\n\nOverall I love the idea of organizing events in major Easter European cities like Kiev, Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. Campaign details seem to cover everything necessary to host these events.\n\nPossible Improvements: my only recommendation would be to get involved more with the community, developers, and stakeholders. You can learn a lot from people that work for this project, and they will get the opportunity to work with your team.  (matrix, Reddit, Slack, twitter)\nYou could be a great asset in Easter Europe and work for Decred as a contractor.\n\nBelow is the list of things I'm concerned about or see as potential roadblocks:\n\n1. Four events to plan and organize. (a lot can go wrong with trying to host four events)\n2. An upfront deposit of 70%. I don't think stakeholders will go for this.\n3. Total budget: I think this area needs some work. Were you able to obtain quotes for spaces, to rent, traveling, etc. for all four cities? As a stakeholder, I'd like to have a bit more details.\n4. How many people are you going to deploy for logistics, etc.?\n\nHave you considered to organize a small local meetup in Kiev on your own and share the outcome with Decred Community? I think this can give you a lot of credibility and respect in the community. \n\nIs there a particular reason you'd like to do these four cities, instead of organizing an event in Kiev for example: see how it goes, and plan your next move accordingly?\n\nThank you guys.","signature":"4c7a867d09c57b2ff7a1a882cc3eb1aae0335f0e59fb30671645c31e4760ce4a2de3077e144ff3ff811243b79dd14c403038484e3ed78f545ee237d8cf53600f","publickey":"5a452f52d8cf2f66a84689107273f3b3b292307877ba6d92d01bb2dfebeee236","commentid":"4","receipt":"7a3426ccadece79381151d5273455869df8d31b143ae24fca4f333a3eca8538b25b200f2370bbd270ea2c691ea6123288750f7337a86fe2da7cfe620c0c1ec0d","timestamp":1568211595,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Like many others have pointed out, the biggest killer of this proposal is the fact that you are asking an upfront payment (the amount is beside the point). Paying in advance is not in the spirit of Politeia no matter how reputable you are. No offense to you but until that is revised, i will not even start to read the rest of the proposal.","signature":"a3324fadc2edd89e89146d0f9f643044344364db1aa80da3771b8f10186ac9dce80ec8540ba71dcce331f56603c366c7e292babe7ab2cb6f34370b8089c5590e","publickey":"88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1","commentid":"15","receipt":"64ac27b780dbad4756d3e2054a9d3f5fe741ef9ce84c1f0f6354d959ba60dfcd41c39f45ae1d3fae4d6cc0b50c2ef5fbd8d853f9b6c63fba5075c022c6dec806","timestamp":1568823951,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
