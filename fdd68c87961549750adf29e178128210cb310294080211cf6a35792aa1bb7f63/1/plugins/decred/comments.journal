As I see it there are a number of major issues which should be addressed.\n\n1. 70% of the budget being distributed upfront is deeply problematic. This would amount to around $22,000 being transferred to people who are largely unknown to the community, with little recourse in the eventuality that you do not deliver.\n1. The suitability of the local speakers to represent Decred is unknown, and the whole value proposition rests on this. To have any chance of success I think you would need to convince the stakeholders that these speakers would represent the project well.\n1. The proposal describes inviting at least one Decred representative from the US to one or two major events. It would be worth finding out if any Decred representatives are willing to attend these events.","signature":"34f94a2d13c8e929c5f6501cd4f1a76e38cb6342bc464cb7d7f2f7e8d620a5e4107ae3bf10c763007530e80d2b06d25db289424ac014bbc20a70ecc518710e09","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"d28cc19dae35645bf3281e9270b26a2dd4a7465ed97e65e0dc807158aed51bc7491dc330424362a222d0bf9b9a0f1c584403058ee6c3f1af35dc2b337d294d04","timestamp":1568144203,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
