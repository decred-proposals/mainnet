This approach really resonates with me, because IMO this is an effective means of scaling Decred’s governance and contributor model.\n\nCrypto projects already use layered approaches for technical scalability, eg Lightning Network.  We need to think of similar layered approaches to governance, where we can move smaller decisions off Politeia as Decred grows.\n\nThis group of people have already proven to be great community members, and the proposed approach will allow for better  coordination and a more cogent narrative.\n\nI do have a question. The proposal as written reads like there’s $50k (or close to it) going towards one conference.  Was this meant to be multiple events, with the Web Summit being a big example? \n\nThanks and good luck.\nAmmar","signature":"f07f9d3e9030af7f4abb8ed188a4c7f76812ed70fcad7e6fbb6ca9227da5a343d8e8faccf851561c51721e2617b5ceb75e22f4dc333a48d6fc8cd1c433024406","publickey":"afebf0a3cf5e482fba44e672cb37cc89698e7717cfa1491518ef833e3334f678","commentid":"2","receipt":"b1683bf166fe958a6676c70009df268ed0142d2e65a9c6852bc6cbd12e3d9fe0003de9341ebbca227423f03beb807be82ae67bc95693560dae5a5dc61459b800","timestamp":1581297473,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Aside from quite a large sum for attending a few conferences, the output deliverable list, objectives and measures of success metrics are not clear. If this is a renewal of a previous set of proposals, I suggest providing a link to last rounds report so we can assess whether the value for money is there. \n\nFor the Web Summit (which I have never heard of),  I agree with praxis, please expand on what Decreds role is and where the funds will be allocated.

In short, the Web Summit is the largest tech event in Europe with ~70k people attending each year. Decred had a booth in 2018 and 2019 and it resulted in direct connections with journalists, exchanges and even a [photo with the prime minister of Portugal](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1192359021904375808). Attendees really appreciated talking to a \"real\" blockchain project, since many of the blockchain / crypto companies were either looking to raise money or were trying to sell you something. Last year we were there with Marco, Kyle, mm, jholdstock, karamble, lukebp and several others. We agreed that we should try to be present again this year. That said, I do share your concern about the budget. Let's hear what the other European ambassadors think, if they share your concern we could do multiple smaller events instead.","signature":"26ed67b8a4122dc7e6c05756ac3be0bb23aea8ab2fc5e9b657412b1448a18cbf24f276324da618d2749eb78b917f1d2cc68f57d954c4383cdd4c7341b02ec401","publickey":"a854b650432a639cacba20b1e84627418c4a408f215c76f0754748746b436da6","commentid":"5","receipt":"9ebf98211d2dbd80c858139120c1036f65f1221b7a659ca91a65c48072992d6ce439962df32e5033f696196306201d4e6c8b8f651a25699ee60cf34baaece303","timestamp":1581569861,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
