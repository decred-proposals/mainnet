This approach really resonates with me, because IMO this is an effective means of scaling Decred’s governance and contributor model.\n\nCrypto projects already use layered approaches for technical scalability, eg Lightning Network.  We need to think of similar layered approaches to governance, where we can move smaller decisions off Politeia as Decred grows.\n\nThis group of people have already proven to be great community members, and the proposed approach will allow for better  coordination and a more cogent narrative.\n\nI do have a question. The proposal as written reads like there’s $50k (or close to it) going towards one conference.  Was this meant to be multiple events, with the Web Summit being a big example? \n\nThanks and good luck.\nAmmar","signature":"f07f9d3e9030af7f4abb8ed188a4c7f76812ed70fcad7e6fbb6ca9227da5a343d8e8faccf851561c51721e2617b5ceb75e22f4dc333a48d6fc8cd1c433024406","publickey":"afebf0a3cf5e482fba44e672cb37cc89698e7717cfa1491518ef833e3334f678","commentid":"2","receipt":"b1683bf166fe958a6676c70009df268ed0142d2e65a9c6852bc6cbd12e3d9fe0003de9341ebbca227423f03beb807be82ae67bc95693560dae5a5dc61459b800","timestamp":1581297473,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Aside from quite a large sum for attending a few conferences, the output deliverable list, objectives and measures of success metrics are not clear. If this is a renewal of a previous set of proposals, I suggest providing a link to last rounds report so we can assess whether the value for money is there. \n\nFor the Web Summit (which I have never heard of),  I agree with praxis, please expand on what Decreds role is and where the funds will be allocated.

In short, the Web Summit is the largest tech event in Europe with ~70k people attending each year. Decred had a booth in 2018 and 2019 and it resulted in direct connections with journalists, exchanges and even a [photo with the prime minister of Portugal](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1192359021904375808). Attendees really appreciated talking to a \"real\" blockchain project, since many of the blockchain / crypto companies were either looking to raise money or were trying to sell you something. Last year we were there with Marco, Kyle, mm, jholdstock, karamble, lukebp and several others. We agreed that we should try to be present again this year. That said, I do share your concern about the budget. Let's hear what the other European ambassadors think, if they share your concern we could do multiple smaller events instead.","signature":"26ed67b8a4122dc7e6c05756ac3be0bb23aea8ab2fc5e9b657412b1448a18cbf24f276324da618d2749eb78b917f1d2cc68f57d954c4383cdd4c7341b02ec401","publickey":"a854b650432a639cacba20b1e84627418c4a408f215c76f0754748746b436da6","commentid":"5","receipt":"9ebf98211d2dbd80c858139120c1036f65f1221b7a659ca91a65c48072992d6ce439962df32e5033f696196306201d4e6c8b8f651a25699ee60cf34baaece303","timestamp":1581569861,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And to correct your assumption: no, I'm not a full time contractor. I only bill for the hours I work productively on the project. Another thing to keep in mind: this proposal is not just for me. It's for every (aspiring) Decred ambassador in Europe who wants to organize Decred events. It also has a connection to [the Exitus proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/95cfb73254a032b2c199c37bb499d6f172d044b1f38016279c5bbca6572251f0), together we could film at events and produce content for the global community (educational as well as promotional).","signature":"daeaa5d88469d9a626d7dee8c4d90287ec4356315bea5581f28d571ac80f3831b3d89673d084440d99812e9881cabb41f7c12b1b3495c21bd8e5274b391b2e00","publickey":"a854b650432a639cacba20b1e84627418c4a408f215c76f0754748746b436da6","commentid":"6","receipt":"0fbb6c8faef7cc4079cb529df721800186ef2205a69245d052497525433e5ac2fee2d3f55ae3bf0b758aef298be8eb414593bf35daa0a0070458f7bbcfa3290e","timestamp":1581570772,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It's a budget for Decred ambassadors to spend on marketing, promotion, education and events on the European continent. Last year these local budgets were included in the global [Events](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d3e7f159b9680c059a3d4b398de2c8f6627108f28b7d61a3f10397acb4b5e509) and [Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e) proposals (in total 490k), but we decided to decentralize the marketing efforts this year.

This proposal is intended as a *carte blanche* for existing contractors who have delivered in the past, as well as to provide an opportunity for prospective Decred ambassadors to prove themselves. It's hard to predict how the project will develop, so I decided not to narrow down the scope. Any budget that's left at the end of the year will stay in the Treasury.

Of course we can decide to change the allocation of funds if the stakeholders require that.

I still feel that as a stakeholder, I still do not know what deliverables are expected from proposal aside from a few people attending conferences. How much is spent on logistics, on time, on branding, what is the breakdown here? Given this is not the first set of conference events, this information should already be on hand. Similarly, the tweets you have provided do not give stakeholders any clarity on the value delivered to Decred, simply that it occurred. What were the outcomes from past events that warrant such large expenses that would be targeted as objectives for this round? What are the lessons learned? \n\nAsking for a blanket $75k for Web Summit + others is an open ended bucket and I do not support this lack of clarity on the who, how, why and what.\n\nThe Decred Treasury must be treated with the utmost respect as a multi-decade long asset. I respect brevity and being concise, however the proposal in it's current format does not have transparency, past performance metrics/reports nor a breakdown of details appropriate for such a large sum of money requested. This is especially true coming from a long term group of contractors who are familiar with this process. The standard must be higher both out of respect for stakeholders, the treasury and as a benchmark for future proposals.","signature":"83007c71fa965b60233d8049a809db838ddf98878d1fb46a195a846362c440d781470e462dc7d330701aa857e9206b65df4e92a9300813ca8738238831b4870d","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"9","receipt":"78ea40c103f9ba57c438188482b0df2765b5222e028951b251b01751ed69c38736142ee282cac3a4725fb2e14eb4bbafe1fa5868cd6a279c8991f6818cb20408","timestamp":1581575550,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
