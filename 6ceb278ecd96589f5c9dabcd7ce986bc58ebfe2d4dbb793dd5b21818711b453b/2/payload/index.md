Decred Europe - Grassroots Marketing and Events Proposal

This proposal will follow the example of the [Latam Marketing and Events Proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1cd325be6be39109c2750f34095c4e8feeea962ede058a1e4f4a61473e). It is a continental effort of contributors in Europe to grow Decred's brand awareness and adoption in the EU and neighboring countries.  Last year these local budgets were included in the global [Events](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d3e7f159b9680c059a3d4b398de2c8f6627108f28b7d61a3f10397acb4b5e509) and [Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e) proposals (in total $490k), but it was **decided to decentralize** the marketing efforts in 2020.

### What?
The objective of this proposal is to have a dedicated budget for operations in Europe that cover marketing, user support, creation of English content and local translations, community outreach, and – perhaps most importantly - local events. This proposal does not exclude independent contractors in Europe from submitting their own proposals, for example for larger events such as the Web Summit.

### Why?
Europe is home to some of the most forward-thinking crypto communities in the world. Several of its countries (Malta, Portugal) and cities (Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague) are making active efforts to stimulate cryptocurrency and blockchain technology adoption. Decred ambassadors should support these efforts in order to make Decred a household name in these crypto communities. 

Furthermore, average European citizens usually have more **disposable income** than people in South America or Africa. This makes Europe a great market to promote DCR as an alternative store of value.

### How?
We will only work with Decred ambassadors who can represent the project in a professional way. Ambassadors will participate in relevant local crypto communities, network with key players in the region, organize and attend events, and share their success on social media. For each event we will require ambassadors to submit a detailed report ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/decredcommunity/events/docs/report-template.md)) that will be published [on GitHub](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/tree/master/reports).

There are several contractors who have proven to be capable of doing this type of work, and this proposal aims to **empower them** without micromanaging their every move. If you are not comfortable with giving these people the freedom to do what they think is best for the project in terms of marketing, education or event organization, you should probably vote against this proposal. 

### Who?
Decred ambassadors in Europe will **collaborate** with global Marketing and Events team members such as Dustorf and keep in contact with Decred communities across the world. This proposal is supported by the following independent contractors: haon (Netherlands), jholdstock (England), kozel (Poland), jazzah (Belgium), mm (Portugal) and karamble (Germany). 

If needed we can recruit more ambassadors in other countries. 

### General Strategy
- **Awareness:** the first aim is to grow Decred’s presence among existing local crypto communities. The second aim is to reach potential new users of digital currencies such as developers. Just like in Latam, our priority will be to target the existing crypto communities with a secondary focus on new audiences. 
- **Adoption:** write and translate guides on how to use the Decred wallets and Lightning Network, attend and organize events around relevant Decred topics, promote the use of DCR as a Store of Value. 
- **Digital Marketing:** local ambassadors are expected to broadcast their activities on their own social media channels. Their posts may be amplified by the @decredproject account(s).
- **User Support:** local ambassadors could act as a first point of contact on social media to resolve technical problems and/or answer general questions about the project.
- **Open Source:** all content must be open source and accessible to everyone in the community.

### Budget Estimation
Naturally, we aim to keep the costs for the project as low as possible. Only ambassadors that have received a contractor clearance (DCC) will be allowed to bill the treasury (in arrears), given that their work is approved by the global Marketing and Events team. This team also retains the right to block ambassadors from receiving DCR if the delivered work is subpar. 

The estimated budget is $49,000 for the remaining 10 months of 2020:

- around $25,000 for ambassador hours (coordination, content, education, promotions)
- around $15,000 for several smaller events (crypto conferences, developer meetups)
- around $9,000 for transport and accommodation expenses of ambassadors

Any budget that's left at the end of 2020 will **remain in the treasury**. Towards the end of 2020 a general report will be shared with the community and a new proposal will be drafted for 2021 to continue activities.
