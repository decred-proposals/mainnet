This approach really resonates with me, because IMO this is an effective means of scaling Decred’s governance and contributor model.\n\nCrypto projects already use layered approaches for technical scalability, eg Lightning Network.  We need to think of similar layered approaches to governance, where we can move smaller decisions off Politeia as Decred grows.\n\nThis group of people have already proven to be great community members, and the proposed approach will allow for better  coordination and a more cogent narrative.\n\nI do have a question. The proposal as written reads like there’s $50k (or close to it) going towards one conference.  Was this meant to be multiple events, with the Web Summit being a big example? \n\nThanks and good luck.\nAmmar","signature":"f07f9d3e9030af7f4abb8ed188a4c7f76812ed70fcad7e6fbb6ca9227da5a343d8e8faccf851561c51721e2617b5ceb75e22f4dc333a48d6fc8cd1c433024406","publickey":"afebf0a3cf5e482fba44e672cb37cc89698e7717cfa1491518ef833e3334f678","commentid":"2","receipt":"b1683bf166fe958a6676c70009df268ed0142d2e65a9c6852bc6cbd12e3d9fe0003de9341ebbca227423f03beb807be82ae67bc95693560dae5a5dc61459b800","timestamp":1581297473,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Aside from quite a large sum for attending a few conferences, the output deliverable list, objectives and measures of success metrics are not clear. If this is a renewal of a previous set of proposals, I suggest providing a link to last rounds report so we can assess whether the value for money is there. \n\nFor the Web Summit (which I have never heard of),  I agree with praxis, please expand on what Decreds role is and where the funds will be allocated.

In short, the Web Summit is the largest tech event in Europe with ~70k people attending each year. Decred had a booth in 2018 and 2019 and it resulted in direct connections with journalists, exchanges and even a [photo with the prime minister of Portugal](https://twitter.com/marco_peereboom/status/1192359021904375808). Attendees really appreciated talking to a \"real\" blockchain project, since many of the blockchain / crypto companies were either looking to raise money or were trying to sell you something. Last year we were there with Marco, Kyle, mm, jholdstock, karamble, lukebp and several others. We agreed that we should try to be present again this year. That said, I do share your concern about the budget. Let's hear what the other European ambassadors think, if they share your concern we could do multiple smaller events instead.","signature":"26ed67b8a4122dc7e6c05756ac3be0bb23aea8ab2fc5e9b657412b1448a18cbf24f276324da618d2749eb78b917f1d2cc68f57d954c4383cdd4c7341b02ec401","publickey":"a854b650432a639cacba20b1e84627418c4a408f215c76f0754748746b436da6","commentid":"5","receipt":"9ebf98211d2dbd80c858139120c1036f65f1221b7a659ca91a65c48072992d6ce439962df32e5033f696196306201d4e6c8b8f651a25699ee60cf34baaece303","timestamp":1581569861,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It's a budget for Decred ambassadors to spend on marketing, promotion, education and events on the European continent. Last year these local budgets were included in the global [Events](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d3e7f159b9680c059a3d4b398de2c8f6627108f28b7d61a3f10397acb4b5e509) and [Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e) proposals (in total 490k), but we decided to decentralize the marketing efforts this year.

This proposal is intended as a *carte blanche* for existing contractors who have delivered in the past, as well as to provide an opportunity for prospective Decred ambassadors to prove themselves. It's hard to predict how the project will develop, so I decided not to narrow down the scope. Any budget that's left at the end of the year will stay in the Treasury.

I still feel that as a stakeholder, I still do not know what deliverables are expected from proposal aside from a few people attending conferences. How much is spent on logistics, on time, on branding, what is the breakdown here? Given this is not the first set of conference events, this information should already be on hand. Similarly, the tweets you have provided do not give stakeholders any clarity on the value delivered to Decred, simply that it occurred. What were the outcomes from past events that warrant such large expenses that would be targeted as objectives for this round? What are the lessons learned? \n\nAsking for a blanket $75k for Web Summit + others is an open ended bucket and I do not support this lack of clarity on the who, how, why and what.\n\nThe Decred Treasury must be treated with the utmost respect as a multi-decade long asset. I respect brevity and being concise, however the proposal in it's current format does not have transparency, past performance metrics/reports nor a breakdown of details appropriate for such a large sum of money requested. This is especially true coming from a long term group of contractors who are familiar with this process. The standard must be higher both out of respect for stakeholders, the treasury and as a benchmark for future proposals.","signature":"83007c71fa965b60233d8049a809db838ddf98878d1fb46a195a846362c440d781470e462dc7d330701aa857e9206b65df4e92a9300813ca8738238831b4870d","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"9","receipt":"78ea40c103f9ba57c438188482b0df2765b5222e028951b251b01751ed69c38736142ee282cac3a4725fb2e14eb4bbafe1fa5868cd6a279c8991f6818cb20408","timestamp":1581575550,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In 2019 this was covered by a global budget (which was $490k in total), but we decided that we should decentralize Decred's marketing efforts. Following the example of the Latam team, we put up a proposal for the European continent. This proposal is a team effort, to prevent voters from having to deal with multiple independent contractors who submit proposals to fund their events or marketing efforts individually. \n\nWhat will happen is a continuation of what you have already seen: independent contractors who attend and organize events to represent Decred in their local crypto communities. There are several contractors who have proven to be capable of doing this type of work, and this proposal aims to empower them without micromanaging their every move.\n\nFor detailed examples, here are [reports](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/tree/master/reports) of events that happened in the past. \n\nPersonally, I am not willing nor able to coordinate every Decred ambassador in Europe. The people that are listed in this proposal have proven to do a good job and I trust that they will continue to do so. If you are not comfortable with giving these people the freedom to do what's best for the project in terms of marketing, education or event organization, you should probably vote against this proposal.

Given his long time Decred background and my experience of collaborating with him I am confident he will manage this budget well.\n\nI fully support the plan to decentralize marketing efforts using multiple proposals and I like the flexibility that this proposal can offer for Europe-based contributors.\n\nOne challenge with multiple marketing proposals is that without due accounting and presentation there is a chance to spend too much. I don't mean this as an argument against this proposal, but noting that such decentralization requires extra tracking/reporting tools for everybody to see the big picture. Specifically, I would be cautious about approving more than total $500K for 2020 marketing, seeing the results of $800K+ in 2019 (and we don't really know how much was really spent).\n\n\u003e marketing, user support, creation of English content and local translations, community outreach, and – perhaps most importantly - local events.\n\nUser support is critical and to me the most important item in this list. It serves people already interested in Decred enough to install the software and dive into the complexities of crypto. But is it good to mix user support into area-local marketing proposal? It often happens via the Internet and is not bound to location. Perhaps there should be a separate budget for all contributors who consistently provide support. Curious what you think.\n\nI'm happy to see Web Summit removed from this proposal. While some footage from WS 2019 was posted on social media, I was disappointed to see no report with expenses, gains and reflections for one of the biggest events of 2019.\n\nLooking at increasing marketing expenses I'm not feeling the impact of spending on large events. It's a good idea to stop including them in these bulk proposals and vote on them separately to see what the stakeholders think.\n\nAlso, instead of \"prestige\"/crypto-echo-chamber/ICO-valley/\"Blockchain Everything!\" type of events I would rather spend on [hacker events](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/83) like the CCC, ideally with some dev presence. I guess staffing will be a challenge but it looks worthwhile.\n\nSpeaking of big and small events in general, over time I become skeptical about funding them as I don't see too much tangible outputs. By that I mean any noticeable number or quality of contributors or users or investors onboarded via these events, any significant local action covered (or omitted) by the media, or a spike of social media activity from users in visited locations. An interesting indicator would be an increase of support requests from visited locations (this would prove real use). A made-up example of a perfect follow-up after the event: \"5 ambassadors attended event X spending $30K. The event was attended by 5K people. Decred team engaged with 200 people. After the event, we are aware that at least 20 users were onboarded, including 1 contributor\". I'd like to see a few stories from people who got involved with Decred after local events. Of course my awareness is limited and I'd be happy to be wrong on this.\n\nOther notes:\n\n- The budget for smaller events is reasonable and doesn't include any big events.\n- The total amount is fair and I'd like to see a similar ~$50K yearly cap for marketing in all regions.\n- I'm okay with this proposal not having an exhausting list of deliverables as long as it will report as they happen, preferrably once a month.\n- Appreciate the 2-week time window for the discussion.\n- I recommend to pay attention to timing at the end of the year and start preparing the report and the next proposal sooner to have an uniterrupted funding for marketing operations.","signature":"a60a5189fd78ea793ffe43a7c6de41d51d01c6aa098401cc848606817a4d592c0e0fd8915ddcb2e745554d09d8af114be8615bf8da62b6d55d5f9f1bd2c1810a","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"21","receipt":"28fbdcdb6f1468847b014b220dfbbaa68c3285e87b681967dd9436696bbe723ef98378445c91257990b7e35191030949015a4bca4246e7567608926e56c8de06","timestamp":1582568029,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The main reason I included support in this proposal is because it was included in the Latam one, and because people often write me in private (via Telegram, Twitter or Whatsapp) to ask questions about Decred and its software. Support questions may be personal, so I'm guessing people prefer contacting a human being they deem trustworthy rather than asking in public chats. Decred ambassadors like myself are recognizable and are therefore a logical point-of-contact. As long as there is no global user support budget, I think it should be included in these local proposals.\n\n\u003e Looking at increasing marketing expenses I'm not feeling the impact of spending on large events. It's a good idea to stop including them in these bulk proposals and vote on them separately to see what the stakeholders think.\n\nYes, this was my line of reasoning as well.\n\n\u003e Appreciate the 2-week time window for the discussion.\n\nI authorized voting now, we've had enough time to discuss this one!\n\n\u003e I recommend to pay attention to timing at the end of the year and start preparing the report and the next proposal sooner to have an uniterrupted funding for marketing operations.\n\nThis is good advice, thank you.","signature":"1d98c7eeaa8c4338ca7e0c08cac5fc1ada980c7998f6174f3c992a664d8bb3b09ac11d20c071581a17ecb2cf35276be378aef41d277c7cf65afe9993f13e3400","publickey":"a854b650432a639cacba20b1e84627418c4a408f215c76f0754748746b436da6","commentid":"24","receipt":"d5e0fc1d56d2f036c462618fcb57481f0c689fbc76252f0fd05169988b3e667315d1ff41a3411f4b7a5848d5aad5205a785f26676874643001c9ec44f8b54805","timestamp":1582571044,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A list of translations is available [on Github](https://github.com/artikozel/decred-translations/blob/master/article_index.md) as well and more content will be added if there is demand.

If you need a number Google these events and get a rough number for yourself. \n-\"The way to measure the impact of this proposal is different than the way to measure the impact of the bitcoin logo on Watford.\" My point was clear, you don't know how to measure impact of either of them. \n-\"One difference is that people watch Watford games to watch soccer in general and the bitcoin logo is tangential to their intent, while people attending a Decred conference are going to learn specifically about Decred and crypto.\" Biggest events are not decred conferences. Decred is just one of many. No, ppl will be browsing and learning about all of them not specifically about Decred.\n\nPeople  try to market decred to your famaly members and after you done(few days should be enough to damage them) give me an exact number to measure your effectivness!!

I am most certainly on board with it as well.  I don't understand why, with 2 days left for voting, that this proposal is likely going to receive a 'NO' vote.  The Web Summit has been removed from the proposal at the request of some stakeholders so we're left with a proposed budget of $49,000 so that Decred ambassadors can do their work across Europe .  First of all, a $49,000 allocation for multiple ambassadors in Europe to generate content, education and promotions, attend conferences/developer meetups and covering their travel/accommodations is beyond modest.  These are proven ambassadors that have already received contractor clearance.  As is stated in the proposal, their work is subject to review and approval by the global Marketing and Events team, and there is a back end safeguard in place whereby an ambassador that does work deemed to be subpar will not be paid.  \n\nThe proposal lays out a framework within which these proven ambassadors can get out there in Europe over the next 10 months and operate with the level of autonomy that they've  been accustomed to and that is necessary, in my opinion, for this type of work.  And then their work is subject to review and approval at time of payment thus they are incentivized to continue to do the kind of quality work they've already done in years past or risk not receiving payment.  \n\nSo if voting ends and this proposal does indeed receive a 'NO' vote.  What then is the plan with regard to ambassadors doing marketing work across Europe?  Does this community prefer that each ambassador submit their own individual budget proposal with an itemized breakdown as to how they will use every bit of funding?  If so, it is my opinion that such an approach will hamstring the work of ambassadors and will result in less ambassadors willing to take on the job when their work and expenditures will come under an unnecessarily high level of scrutiny.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're talking about 50k here for something that's absolutely necessary.  The effectiveness of marketing is an elusive metric and oftentimes it may seem as if it isn't working or bringing in the desired result.  But it works best when its done with consistent persistence over long time periods.  This is how brand awareness is achieved in marketing. \n\n  This is a competitive market now.  Decred has competitors and more will come.  While I believe Decred is a sleeping giant with massive potential, there is certainly a risk that the community could inadvertently prevent that giant from waking if it doesn't allow for aggressive, consistent and persistent marketing campaigns to be deployed via the type of streamlined, discretionary budgeting outlined in this proposal.\n\nVote YES people, and let's move forward.  Don't shoot yourselves in the foot.","signature":"441d9eb280982fa84fb52e273889f9bd9e74c7c33ba963b748d0b016abe7d3fb6b2dd2d2fba751fdf99904e4314ee009e76705533cfe16521a26183ac659fe0d","publickey":"66ec70cca927403698cfd5ad70caf02486182463f7cab7c2df8d3dcea87960ca","commentid":"29","receipt":"31a06921b78300ec55b14623bab2efca15391e7726a837e337cc6b4a8b4b1576c089187de59ec3839f9d57aef52c34e20ef4936647b9498c74262803d6cea109","timestamp":1583079463,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

To date, successful proposal creators have strove to provide clear details and examples for their work. Even unsuccessful proposals have tried to make their best case, even while failing. This proposal appears to be taking an aggressive stance against the stakeholders, going as far as to tell them to vote against the proposal if they are not willing to accept it on the appeal to authority of the names given. Transparency and openness about deliverables, which is necessary for collaboration, is equated with micromanaging. This puts the stakeholders in a few difficult positions. Stakeholders are expected to make this decision without clear details about the work. This would set a bad precedent for how proposal owners should make their best case. The proposal passing could be net positive for decred in terms of the work it could yield, but the information making the case for this is not being shown. Stakeholders would have to reduce requirements and be more experimental in order to see what the proposal yields without being given clear details. If information about deliverables is being refused from the outset, it likely follows that the necessary information would not be disclosed in the future. While much of our collective process is still coming online, I am concerned about precedents for the future that would be set on politeia.

I'm sorry but $49k for multiple, proven ambassadors to do their work across a continent for 10 months is beyond modest and will likely be constraining enough as it is for these ambassadors to pull it off at that price point. the only precedent that will be set here is that the decision to decentralize marketing decisions led to decred ambassadors being sidelined in Europe due to stakeholders requesting overly detailed information on deliverables.  some proposals likely require total transparency and openness about deliverables.  that can't always be the case and it isn't here.    there has to be some level of delegation to those that work in a specific field, especially an industry like marketing where deliverables are significantly more difficult to assess in terms of their overall benefit compared to costs incurred.  \n\nin any event, this is going to be a 'NO' vote it seems and I hope a new proposal can be submitted which may satisfy some of the concerns raised (I believe it is good to go as is).  the goal here is to get the ambassadors back out there in europe doing their work which they've done in years past.  they won't be doing that until a majority votes to pay for it and in the meantime decred misses out on further exposure in europe\n\nI am harping on about this because I view this as a red flag for problems that may occur in the future with a system like this and because i see marketing as absolutely essential right now for decred.  at some point the community will have to come to terms with the fact that its going to be untenable to always operate with a collective unwillingness to delegate out some discretion as to budget expenditures.   \n\nhope to see a new proposal on this very soon ...","signature":"ae57bf0fe572e02cb7d0af047fc0aaf4fc3cffeaafbfcaffe2fbb0ad3311f955c42387b4970abebd9d21ee7924a6b1ecebee96b46ac0482048462430db80af09","publickey":"66ec70cca927403698cfd5ad70caf02486182463f7cab7c2df8d3dcea87960ca","commentid":"31","receipt":"7b771f692af63068fb14c5fb11c937f5dbe835e5719901e0d1035df812411b7c636c2c27046bb39aef2a4f6f4cf5546d97fd5572d883902424c2137391d2f302","timestamp":1583121248,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
