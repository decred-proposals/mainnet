Content Production for Decred in russian

**Summary**

My proposal presumes funding for 2 months of video (perhaps not only) content creation about Decred project and community in russian language. I am convinced there is high demand for this type of content based also on my own experience, since there is quite a little of this content on youtube now (most of it is outdated) and russian crypto community is pretty big.  This will help educate and engage new and different type of newcomers.

**Why**

As already mentioned above, russian community is huge (second language of the internet after all) and there is a noticeable lack of information. I intend to provide all the relevant and necessary information, starting from the beginner guides, and in perspective finishing by explaining other great decred contributors' analysis, like checkmatey's.

**General Videos about Decred**

A sample of videos I would like to make (in russian):

- Beginners Guide to Decred in 2020
- Benefits of becoming a Decred Stakeholder
- Decred's Origin Explained 
- Decred's Pre-Mine Explained
- Explain Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable 
- How to become a Decred contractor
- How to Stake 
- How Decred is more Secure due to PoS/PoW.
- Video breaking down Privacy Features
- Videos about the Lightning Network
- Videos covering the work of DCR's Researchers 
- Mobile Wallet Overviews
- And so on.

I am also planning to borrow some content from english content makers and remake/translate (if they wouldn't mind of course) it for russian auditory. 

**Goals**

My aim is to deliver good quality, useful and interesting content for russian auditory. The style of the videos will probably vary, like podcasts, reviews, livestreams maybe, etc.

I aim to deliver 5+ videos a month to be posted on my youtube account.

**How**

This work generally includes:
- Translation
- Gathering relevant Content/Data/Research
- Scripting
- Filming
- Editing
- Feedback + Finalization
- Dissemination

**Who**

I am just a humble small stakeholder since 2017.  The first time I've heard about decred was one of interviews with Charlie (founder of litecoin) (of course in english, by the way)

I got inspired by recent proposal from [Exitus](https://proposals.decred.org/user/65706d2f-f82b-4aa5-b4eb-4b1140f4f41f?tab=proposals) *(Exitus, thank you, and I hope you don't mind, that I borrowed some parts of your template, I think it would be silly to rewrite it)* and realised, that I can really do something useful and necessary for my favourite coin and decred community.

My fresh youtube Channel and first simple introduction video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjXbEDeyhhj2bH2t_eGKGA?view_as=subscriber)

Since I will (I hope I will) be a quite new member of the team, I propose only 2 months of work at first and at lower prices, in case community wouldn't like something about me or my work.

**Cost:**

 I will spend 20+ hours a week working on video (perhaps also other social media) content.

At a rate of $25 USD/Hour this comes out to $2000 per month paid in DCR.

**When**

Starting immediately and lasting for 2 months, after which I will create a Proposal for Renewal.

**Thanks for your attention!**
