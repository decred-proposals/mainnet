This is speculation. I am also still not sure what exactly is being paid for, it sounds like 39k paid for a spot on a number of TV slots with NASDAQ however you cite no references that you work for or have actual contact with such an organisation. Many features do no feel right to me about this proposal.","signature":"3331623de280ae60e5663b9dd1517a1eaa02e7cdd9b81d53d12b0b56d2054970644998d1cbda76c2ef665baf4baf7dd95d258e86fe45e65c60e917f9894a110e","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"1","receipt":"07031ebcbddc72e8160b46027372e2e43990d9b0876cd2658fb47d10f4f41ed9c46722a5631756ddc7d73dd1c156ebe21ed8be2c172dff56c12ce6a4cad2db0b","timestamp":1589835470,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
