TV Marketing For Decred (DCR)

**Objective:**

Increase Decred (DCR)'s; user base, adoption, awareness, investor relations and market cap through T.V. Marketing.

**Opportunity:**

During this global transitional period, marketing is essential for blockchain companies.

The world is becoming more dependent on technology. As a result, the T.V. Networks have allotted more airtime for blockchain projects in order to increase adoption.

**Introduction:**

My name is [Reese Irish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reese-irish/), and as the CEO of [W3BT: Web 3.0 Blockchain Transition](https://w3bt.io), I am officially inviting Decred (DCR) to the NASDAQ to be broadcast on FMW's T.V. Broadcast Network that includes; FOX Business, KRON, Bloomberg, and other media outlets.

W3BT works Closely with FMW Media Works Corp.'s T.V. Program called ["Exploring The Block"](http://exploringtheblock.com/). 

This blockchain-focused T.V. show is designed to increase the adoption of blockhain technology through [TV Marketing](https://w3bt.io/tv-marketing/). 

Learn more about W3BT & FMW [here](https://w3bt.io/about/).


**Potential Broadcast Reach Breakdown of FMW's T.V. Network:**

• FOX Business: (95 + M households)
• Bloomberg (U.S. & International): (combined potential reach of +549 M households)
• iSUN Asia: (24 M households)
• Cumulus Media: (245 M households)
• Cultura Colectiva: (81 M households)
• ionTV: (100 M households)
• KRON: (2.7M households)
• and other outlets.

The Decred project will benefit greatly from this level of exposure because many institutional investors follow this blockchain TV program and will make a big difference for (DCR).

**This T.V. exposure has the potential to increase:**

• Market cap: (+731%)
• Daily trade volume: (+632%)
• Token price: (+901%)
• Investor relations

**How it works:**

A 7-12 minute interview is conducted with Decred’s leadership and the NASDAQ Studio Staff in New York City. Decred will write about 7 interview questions in order to control the direction and content of the interview. The NASDAQ team will then edit and closed caption the interview. Then the content is broadcast in a biographical multi-part series format on KRON, FOX, & Bloomberg and more... (All content is co-owned with the TV networks and Decred (DCR).) 

**Binance Case Study:**

A few months ago Binance was on this Blockchain TV Program and they got more responses from one interview than their entire marketing team & community got in 3 months.
