I would have said: do you know that TV show, \"Shark tank\"?  Well it's like that, except there are thousands of sharks instead of just 5 sharks, and the sharks are really not sharks, but an assortment of seafood, plankton, some carp and trouts, and then a massive, 200 tonne, 25m massive blue whale in the middle.  It's so massive that it bends spacetime around itself.  It's a thing to behold I tell ya\n\nSo I began to appreciate the entertainment aspect of Politeia more.   \"Honk, honk!\" \n\nAs for your proposal, it's a time of crisis now, so we will all need cartoons to keep us jolly and give that inner warmth we all need during these difficult times.  I cannot think of something more important than cartoons during times of hardship actually.  I don't see you providing metrics, and I see Instagram has cca 90 followers.  I imagine it's the same DCR people you see in \"our\" comms that like and follow these, but who cares about boring metrics.  I know this stuff is viral and let's forget about stats. Life is more than metrics and stats. Life is art.  I begin to see life more and more from an Oscar Gamboe perspective.\n\nI like it, my only criticism is the price. I think $1350 for a comic is way undervalued. I would urge you to edit it to at least $2999. Listen, the Treasury coffers are full, we need to spend them some way.  Hiphop, cartoons, taking selfies in pubs and claling it an  'event', google/facebook ads, this is the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and undoubtedly also Tacotime.  Tacotime would be proud of what we've built, a vibrant commune.  This is cypherpunk and what crypto is all about.  \n\nBack to the Proposal, you say it takes 9h of work to upload it to social media, I'd say make that number higher, take your time... it's covid, we all stay home longer and have more time.  Make it at least 19h. \n\nI'll support this but only if you ask for more, at this absurdly low price I don't have the heart to support it, it would feel like we're stealing from you, and I'm no thief.\n\n","signature":"8d11a28e8782405e6ba94e75f79fdb7e263f572fb30b10184a7dc822cf04f19b25eb2d45a8e9d58c235895335a8251b3a43118807a5be548caa3cdbb80f75b09","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"8c112275f2027daeb76d343c5b852e6f214d8064dca0973466c92178516501da233784cb1074eb714b1db5c477c7faed53993239340e576e73271f66ec957505","timestamp":1585000674,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Remember that Politeia is not a blog, I would recommend opening up some Medium page or setting up your own Github pages site to publish your humoristic? ranting.\n\nAnyway, I'll try to answer everything you pointed out:\n\n1. Most Twitter metrics are public, we've focused on that platform and I've uploaded a visualization of the data I've scrapped from the @dcrcomic account. If you want more metrics, let me know what kind of stats do you care about, I'll gladly grab them and post them.\n2. If you think the product of our work if overvalued, we can discuss how/where to cut work hours.\n3. Those 9 hours of SM management include the work we do every day. We not only upload the comics, but generate content and try to use the small but growing reach the @dcrcomic account has to spread new developments or bits about Decred's culture that could help newcomers understand how the community operates. The [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) included only 4 hours of SM management per comic, that's just 8 hours per month to manage several accounts. With little resources, we managed to provide much needed content (in the form of retweets) for the main @decredproject Twitter account. We added hours because we find ourselves working more on it because we believe it is needed.\n\nI completely agree with your take on metrics/data and that the Treasury should carefully spend it's reserves. It might not be the best time to present this proposal, but I'm starting to see it never is. Now, with most events cancelled, I would argue that it is also not the best time to cancel content generation projects.\n\nYes, this is a cryptocurrency, a cypherpunk thing. But it is also a community driven project and maintaining and spreading the culture requires work. Sadly, because of people like you that try its best to offend others who may not know how to start collaborating with the project it takes a lot of work to close the gap between those who can code and those who may but see it as an activity reserved for geniuses and top-school engineers. Cryptocurrency is not only \"cypherpunk\", it is about inclusion and this kind of messages are not helping us get more hands to work on the repos. If you want more cypherpunk, help us get more people contributing with the project or start coding yourself.\n\nThis is not about you pointing out what this proposal lacks or should improve. This is about the tone.","signature":"92308b63c1ad547bc53e6df6423a81d97d6f681d9799a330fdcb4f26b2b016077d9123aa7a9b2deb433ff7348548d587c5312025e91f16f75973b5c9ff74e901","publickey":"78d8ff0b05d20c593ab45a2ff3d55dd61b421bc599585e6c5cc2e409947dd950","commentid":"2","receipt":"a8062d2c8ce52567d775f1e15a2462d1acb9b657619715a05f4be72d159b2882f01437ce40452a4301a24f4bf606983443df4a667f66e00b2fc2408f82290109","timestamp":1585004706,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is due to little actual result being brought to table on meaningfully explaining concepts as well the created assets not being picked up in practical use. The presented \"why?\" – as to just \"highlight a need … to do all kinds of things\" doesn't hold up. I doubt the 1st round of comics brought in any new contributors, grew the community significantly or was often referred to in cases asking for support/questions. Thus i'll be voting no. \n\n\n**Concept/Approach**\n\nThe authors have taken an approach of combining low hanging pop culture references with Stakey, and extending it on various topics. Where-as this approach is quite common in marketing and advertising things, it tends to fail on making complex and novel topics easier to understand. \n\nIn my opinion, the latest comics obfuscate and dumb down what should not be dumbed down, but ratherbe  thoughtfully simplified and eloquently communicated. Ie. reviewing the last three comics, the way the narrative comes together with the visuals and copy is just not very comprehensible (dcrtime - back to future, atomic swaps - pokemons?), as there's no clear addressing of an idea or a point. Instead, this lack of clarity on making a point with the narrative is hidden in noise – screaming visuals and over the top emotions. Making characters super emotional doesn’t explain anything. Making things visually overwhelming and super flashy might make it catchy for some and for the first few times, but becomes very annoying after a while.\n\n\n**Technicalities **\n\nAs stated there's been no interest from the community in re-using the assets. So I take it that the social media accounts would be the only considerable output left. Dcrcomic account posts average some ~40 likes, combined with a quite small following of ~300 users, which I would question if they are mostly made up of existing community members? Considering the amount of content being hammered out and ~20% of each comics budget going to \"posting on/adapting to social networks\" – the numbers aren't favoring. \n\nNotably the accounts' most popular post is the [Ticket Rick with infringing Rick \u0026 Morty screencaps](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1204049820350111744). If you're being paid to produce the content, you can't just post a modified image of copyrighted content. Adult Swim/Warner Bros are particularly hard on copyright infringements. Something to think about here is also the fact that this piece of content, which in my books shouldn't even pass as acceptable, significantly outperforms the rest of the content you're paid to create. \n\nFrom design standpoint, the comics in twitter aren't properly legible. Being difficult to read is a failure at explaining. Simply uploading print standard A4 size images without any optimizing, and expecting everything to be well readable on various screens doesn't work. Ie. [on a 27\" screen I need already to squint my eyes at default full size](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1222874521507717121). Ever tried looking at this on mobile even?\n\n\n**Appropriateness **\n\nBoth myself and Lustosa have given you feedback in #design/riot prior to the initial proposal of not stretching Stakey across every single aspect of the project. I take it was largely just ignored, as afterward there has been no attempt to contact or bring things up for feedback even. So i’ll repeat the point – Stakey was designed with intention of explaining Staking. Taking it across every other aspect of the project leads to cognitive dissonance by making the metaphors conflict. \n\nI like Stakey as a way to explain staking, I'm fine with authentic Stakey memes being made here and there and where reasonable – I don’t like artificial cult of stakey as DCR’s another ad campaign.

Of course, due to the nature of the comic itself, there are many things that we must shorten and simplify, and for that reason we always encourage people to keep on reading at the end of each issue.\n\nAs for the approach, we wanted high impact images; of course, some people may like the drawing style much more than others. By using references from pop culture we try to bring the reader closer so that they can recognize certain aspects of this technology by comparing them. In the #7 issue - \"Atomic Swaps\", the exchange of currencies that are not from the same blockchain but from the same universe (that are not of the same type, but from the same world) make it more approachable and understandable, with a simple concept. Also, if the reader does not know the Pokemon world, they can understand that they are transactions between different type of currencies.\n\nRegarding technicality, it is true that the community has not shown much interest in reusing the assets beyond making new stickers for Telegram, and retweets/shares, and we constantly encourage the community to do so. If you compare our 300 followers, with an average of 40 likes per publication, there are many accounts that handle a much higher volume of followers, but have much less engagement.\n\nI do believe that it is a matter of time for the account to grow, and engagement will continue to rise. However, I do consider that the numbers could be higher, and that without the support of the community we would be advancing at a much slower pace.\n\nAs for the design of the pieces published on Twitter, it is true that they could be improved. On Instagram, where the comic is presented almost always frame by frame, the readability is improved. We might as well adopt this method, or seek another. At this point I invite you to our channel on Riot (#dcrcomic) where we can talk about this with the community too. We read your comments and lustosas's carefully and tried to leverage your knowledge working for Decred and improving the brand. I believe we have never ignored you or anyone in the community.\n\nFinally, [I do remember your comment on #design about the use of Stakey](https://matrix.to/#/!HaHmgKVqGNlBrmPZCJ:decred.org/$15668144777496YzCPA:decred.org?via=decred.org\u0026via=matrix.org) exclusively for what 'stake' is on the project, which we took into account. Having only Stakey as Decred's only official mascot, we opted for the development of a Stakey universe (where we don't use the name 'Stakey' to refer to him to avoid confusion). We believe that a single, clear narrator who 'carries the Decred flag' is enough to explain concepts as easy as possible, although we are slowly incorporating new characters to avoid that particular issue you are pointing out.","signature":"6f9c56be05a8580c710e1e29f37344c4c7800f3973a046cf58e00b9974e678c809abaa1584596b02ea6cecf812a0aab44949da85e7bf4b5f6a227b80aedf7b05","publickey":"5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765","commentid":"11","receipt":"007c868f196a20a49ac9d93bcc8294715056568dc5a5a058f19a3ae9bec2e95d0d5c3dcd2f2cd02fcf48af96c6c31da18599c35094e6e10797c53efc5a99c40c","timestamp":1585077735,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I am Marcelo Lustosa, a graphic designer from Brazil, and started to work on Decred around 2017. Back then, I was reading the Decred docs and I had an insight on the topic \"The Ticket Lifecycle\": since tickets play a key role in Decred, maybe I could make a mascot from it to produce informational cartoons and explain why tickets are so important in our system. It also fits perfectly the ticket statuses: immature as a baby ticket, live as an adult one, and so on.\n\nSo i made the first comic \"[The Ticket Lifecycle](https://twitter.com/marcelolustosa/status/874751669917167618)\". The community loved the mascot, and JZ named it Stakey. Further on, i made two more comics, about the \"[ticket price algo change] (https://twitter.com/marcelolustosa/status/883377392038883329)\" - it was a thing back in the day - and the \"[Lightning Network](https://twitter.com/marcelolustosa/status/877590917288534016)\", which the project started to work with at that time. The LN comic barely feature Stakey, it only appears to say ticket holdlers approved the LN development. I was aware back then that Stakey only makes sense when we are talking about the ticket system.\n\nBriefly later, the very first criticism started to appear. People form the community started questioning the target audience: while there were a desire to target new investors for the project, the comic audience theorically is much younger. Basically there were fear of making the project look childish and scare investors away. On the other hand, most people agree that illustrating the Decred's fundamentals could be a powerful tool to strengthen the project. There must be a healthy midterm.\n\nSoon, the community went into a consensus, and it became kind of a mantra: \"Do not overuse Stakey\". It is fine for talk about Decred Proof-of-Stake and the related governance aspects, and community engagement or cultural approaches, as in merch for events, customized Stakey for a particular country, plush toys and *et cetera*. This is stated in the Stakey Package, under [Decred Design release on github](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases). In other words, I still own the copyright on the ticket drawing and **I DO NOT AUTHORIZE ANY USAGE BEYOND THESE. I feel that you are using the sympathy we build on Stakey to get your proposals approved.**\n\nAccordingly to the comments that may follow mine, we can consider setting up a proposal to pass all rights on the ticket mascot to Decred Holdings Group, and in case it gets approved, the mascot would be usable for whatever stakeholders approve on Politeia. \n\nOtherwise, you need to find graphic solutions to the other aspects of Decred universe that you willing to cover, instead of using the ticket mascot for privacy, miners, dex, traders, developers and so on, as you done until now. I've provided you an example when you first came with your cartoons [here](https://matrix.to/#/!HaHmgKVqGNlBrmPZCJ:decred.org/$156710366013788PlxAF:decred.org?via=decred.org\u0026via=matrix.org) but you simply ignored it. I'm sure you can come up with good solutions using the hours you described on your proposal, since you barely mention the mascot on it.","signature":"4f1186dc25554a11401420623c649a2214cc02956ef02ae54d137eb0525a77796b713f3d92556ee6edd1c7d38ef0ee1eb5d16700508b6f0cf020174d284b2906","publickey":"f3fb3ba654b02769c7a6428b26d818ec6730fb622f724de7d422233c7444e235","commentid":"13","receipt":"f11078ed64450552bcd4a2cb958b047a02ddf97369a69ca22e71b91834e75d9fc8fbc50fe378aef8319564326919a537a7631eff6743fcda94026405e04acf0a","timestamp":1585163848,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
