I would have said: do you know that TV show, \"Shark tank\"?  Well it's like that, except there are thousands of sharks instead of just 5 sharks, and the sharks are really not sharks, but an assortment of seafood, plankton, some carp and trouts, and then a massive, 200 tonne, 25m massive blue whale in the middle.  It's so massive that it bends spacetime around itself.  It's a thing to behold I tell ya\n\nSo I began to appreciate the entertainment aspect of Politeia more.   \"Honk, honk!\" \n\nAs for your proposal, it's a time of crisis now, so we will all need cartoons to keep us jolly and give that inner warmth we all need during these difficult times.  I cannot think of something more important than cartoons during times of hardship actually.  I don't see you providing metrics, and I see Instagram has cca 90 followers.  I imagine it's the same DCR people you see in \"our\" comms that like and follow these, but who cares about boring metrics.  I know this stuff is viral and let's forget about stats. Life is more than metrics and stats. Life is art.  I begin to see life more and more from an Oscar Gamboe perspective.\n\nI like it, my only criticism is the price. I think $1350 for a comic is way undervalued. I would urge you to edit it to at least $2999. Listen, the Treasury coffers are full, we need to spend them some way.  Hiphop, cartoons, taking selfies in pubs and claling it an  'event', google/facebook ads, this is the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and undoubtedly also Tacotime.  Tacotime would be proud of what we've built, a vibrant commune.  This is cypherpunk and what crypto is all about.  \n\nBack to the Proposal, you say it takes 9h of work to upload it to social media, I'd say make that number higher, take your time... it's covid, we all stay home longer and have more time.  Make it at least 19h. \n\nI'll support this but only if you ask for more, at this absurdly low price I don't have the heart to support it, it would feel like we're stealing from you, and I'm no thief.\n\n","signature":"8d11a28e8782405e6ba94e75f79fdb7e263f572fb30b10184a7dc822cf04f19b25eb2d45a8e9d58c235895335a8251b3a43118807a5be548caa3cdbb80f75b09","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"8c112275f2027daeb76d343c5b852e6f214d8064dca0973466c92178516501da233784cb1074eb714b1db5c477c7faed53993239340e576e73271f66ec957505","timestamp":1585000674,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Remember that Politeia is not a blog, I would recommend opening up some Medium page or setting up your own Github pages site to publish your humoristic? ranting.\n\nAnyway, I'll try to answer everything you pointed out:\n\n1. Most Twitter metrics are public, we've focused on that platform and I've uploaded a visualization of the data I've scrapped from the @dcrcomic account. If you want more metrics, let me know what kind of stats do you care about, I'll gladly grab them and post them.\n2. If you think the product of our work if overvalued, we can discuss how/where to cut work hours.\n3. Those 9 hours of SM management include the work we do every day. We not only upload the comics, but generate content and try to use the small but growing reach the @dcrcomic account has to spread new developments or bits about Decred's culture that could help newcomers understand how the community operates. The [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) included only 4 hours of SM management per comic, that's just 8 hours per month to manage several accounts. With little resources, we managed to provide much needed content (in the form of retweets) for the main @decredproject Twitter account. We added hours because we find ourselves working more on it because we believe it is needed.\n\nI completely agree with your take on metrics/data and that the Treasury should carefully spend it's reserves. It might not be the best time to present this proposal, but I'm starting to see it never is. Now, with most events cancelled, I would argue that it is also not the best time to cancel content generation projects.\n\nYes, this is a cryptocurrency, a cypherpunk thing. But it is also a community driven project and maintaining and spreading the culture requires work. Sadly, because of people like you that try its best to offend others who may not know how to start collaborating with the project it takes a lot of work to close the gap between those who can code and those who may but see it as an activity reserved for geniuses and top-school engineers. Cryptocurrency is not only \"cypherpunk\", it is about inclusion and this kind of messages are not helping us get more hands to work on the repos. If you want more cypherpunk, help us get more people contributing with the project or start coding yourself.\n\nThis is not about you pointing out what this proposal lacks or should improve. This is about the tone.","signature":"92308b63c1ad547bc53e6df6423a81d97d6f681d9799a330fdcb4f26b2b016077d9123aa7a9b2deb433ff7348548d587c5312025e91f16f75973b5c9ff74e901","publickey":"78d8ff0b05d20c593ab45a2ff3d55dd61b421bc599585e6c5cc2e409947dd950","commentid":"2","receipt":"a8062d2c8ce52567d775f1e15a2462d1acb9b657619715a05f4be72d159b2882f01437ce40452a4301a24f4bf606983443df4a667f66e00b2fc2408f82290109","timestamp":1585004706,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is due to little actual result being brought to table on meaningfully explaining concepts as well the created assets not being picked up in practical use. The presented \"why?\" – as to just \"highlight a need … to do all kinds of things\" doesn't hold up. I doubt the 1st round of comics brought in any new contributors, grew the community significantly or was often referred to in cases asking for support/questions. Thus i'll be voting no. \n\n\n**Concept/Approach**\n\nThe authors have taken an approach of combining low hanging pop culture references with Stakey, and extending it on various topics. Where-as this approach is quite common in marketing and advertising things, it tends to fail on making complex and novel topics easier to understand. \n\nIn my opinion, the latest comics obfuscate and dumb down what should not be dumbed down, but ratherbe  thoughtfully simplified and eloquently communicated. Ie. reviewing the last three comics, the way the narrative comes together with the visuals and copy is just not very comprehensible (dcrtime - back to future, atomic swaps - pokemons?), as there's no clear addressing of an idea or a point. Instead, this lack of clarity on making a point with the narrative is hidden in noise – screaming visuals and over the top emotions. Making characters super emotional doesn’t explain anything. Making things visually overwhelming and super flashy might make it catchy for some and for the first few times, but becomes very annoying after a while.\n\n\n**Technicalities **\n\nAs stated there's been no interest from the community in re-using the assets. So I take it that the social media accounts would be the only considerable output left. Dcrcomic account posts average some ~40 likes, combined with a quite small following of ~300 users, which I would question if they are mostly made up of existing community members? Considering the amount of content being hammered out and ~20% of each comics budget going to \"posting on/adapting to social networks\" – the numbers aren't favoring. \n\nNotably the accounts' most popular post is the [Ticket Rick with infringing Rick \u0026 Morty screencaps](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1204049820350111744). If you're being paid to produce the content, you can't just post a modified image of copyrighted content. Adult Swim/Warner Bros are particularly hard on copyright infringements. Something to think about here is also the fact that this piece of content, which in my books shouldn't even pass as acceptable, significantly outperforms the rest of the content you're paid to create. \n\nFrom design standpoint, the comics in twitter aren't properly legible. Being difficult to read is a failure at explaining. Simply uploading print standard A4 size images without any optimizing, and expecting everything to be well readable on various screens doesn't work. Ie. [on a 27\" screen I need already to squint my eyes at default full size](https://twitter.com/DCRComic/status/1222874521507717121). Ever tried looking at this on mobile even?\n\n\n**Appropriateness **\n\nBoth myself and Lustosa have given you feedback in #design/riot prior to the initial proposal of not stretching Stakey across every single aspect of the project. I take it was largely just ignored, as afterward there has been no attempt to contact or bring things up for feedback even. So i’ll repeat the point – Stakey was designed with intention of explaining Staking. Taking it across every other aspect of the project leads to cognitive dissonance by making the metaphors conflict. \n\nI like Stakey as a way to explain staking, I'm fine with authentic Stakey memes being made here and there and where reasonable – I don’t like artificial cult of stakey as DCR’s another ad campaign.

I would never read this or recommend this content to learn about Decred when the same/better information is on the website. I would never read this or recommend this content for its entertainment or marketing value either. I am a Decred fan and I found it extremely boring. This is supposed to be a comic... where is the story, the villains, the entertainment, ...anything original!? For what was paid and what this could be, I found the result to be very *disappointing*.\n\nI voted NO on the previous proposal and will emphatically **vote NO** on this proposal.\n\nStakey is cool though. *Please* don't vote for this just because you like Stakey or think this will somehow drive up the price of DCR.","signature":"7beffad1d2979c66a3f7766d9991ec4ed9600375680706cfb8b883afc67e502cd87af870c6e96c42f166fbf4e33c9f2981b44558c7dd18c0bbc71a520ef3230d","publickey":"47eb417c78f320dcf5bdf81c04fbdfeb27fc299d6e1567e5a20c1dbe79f02a63","commentid":"7","receipt":"4dddace3ccee18b85b62c8435306c22d1dd84586af9af2c4cb9a0fc59f2b5b37e9c8dc30e996c1feed90460852412c9b335509206a5df018a5476c943282de0b","timestamp":1585072436,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
