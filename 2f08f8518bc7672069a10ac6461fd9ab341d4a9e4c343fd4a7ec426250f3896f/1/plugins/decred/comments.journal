I would have said: do you know that TV show, \"Shark tank\"?  Well it's like that, except there are thousands of sharks instead of just 5 sharks, and the sharks are really not sharks, but an assortment of seafood, plankton, some carp and trouts, and then a massive, 200 tonne, 25m massive blue whale in the middle.  It's so massive that it bends spacetime around itself.  It's a thing to behold I tell ya\n\nSo I began to appreciate the entertainment aspect of Politeia more.   \"Honk, honk!\" \n\nAs for your proposal, it's a time of crisis now, so we will all need cartoons to keep us jolly and give that inner warmth we all need during these difficult times.  I cannot think of something more important than cartoons during times of hardship actually.  I don't see you providing metrics, and I see Instagram has cca 90 followers.  I imagine it's the same DCR people you see in \"our\" comms that like and follow these, but who cares about boring metrics.  I know this stuff is viral and let's forget about stats. Life is more than metrics and stats. Life is art.  I begin to see life more and more from an Oscar Gamboe perspective.\n\nI like it, my only criticism is the price. I think $1350 for a comic is way undervalued. I would urge you to edit it to at least $2999. Listen, the Treasury coffers are full, we need to spend them some way.  Hiphop, cartoons, taking selfies in pubs and claling it an  'event', google/facebook ads, this is the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and undoubtedly also Tacotime.  Tacotime would be proud of what we've built, a vibrant commune.  This is cypherpunk and what crypto is all about.  \n\nBack to the Proposal, you say it takes 9h of work to upload it to social media, I'd say make that number higher, take your time... it's covid, we all stay home longer and have more time.  Make it at least 19h. \n\nI'll support this but only if you ask for more, at this absurdly low price I don't have the heart to support it, it would feel like we're stealing from you, and I'm no thief.\n\n","signature":"8d11a28e8782405e6ba94e75f79fdb7e263f572fb30b10184a7dc822cf04f19b25eb2d45a8e9d58c235895335a8251b3a43118807a5be548caa3cdbb80f75b09","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"8c112275f2027daeb76d343c5b852e6f214d8064dca0973466c92178516501da233784cb1074eb714b1db5c477c7faed53993239340e576e73271f66ec957505","timestamp":1585000674,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Remember that Politeia is not a blog, I would recommend opening up some Medium page or setting up your own Github pages site to publish your humoristic? ranting.\n\nAnyway, I'll try to answer everything you pointed out:\n\n1. Most Twitter metrics are public, we've focused on that platform and I've uploaded a visualization of the data I've scrapped from the @dcrcomic account. If you want more metrics, let me know what kind of stats do you care about, I'll gladly grab them and post them.\n2. If you think the product of our work if overvalued, we can discuss how/where to cut work hours.\n3. Those 9 hours of SM management include the work we do every day. We not only upload the comics, but generate content and try to use the small but growing reach the @dcrcomic account has to spread new developments or bits about Decred's culture that could help newcomers understand how the community operates. The [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa5f0b558442cb85b1235c8c551a51ff5d8b8de44dead48b8b59c8fc1de) included only 4 hours of SM management per comic, that's just 8 hours per month to manage several accounts. With little resources, we managed to provide much needed content (in the form of retweets) for the main @decredproject Twitter account. We added hours because we find ourselves working more on it because we believe it is needed.\n\nI completely agree with your take on metrics/data and that the Treasury should carefully spend it's reserves. It might not be the best time to present this proposal, but I'm starting to see it never is. Now, with most events cancelled, I would argue that it is also not the best time to cancel content generation projects.\n\nYes, this is a cryptocurrency, a cypherpunk thing. But it is also a community driven project and maintaining and spreading the culture requires work. Sadly, because of people like you that try its best to offend others who may not know how to start collaborating with the project it takes a lot of work to close the gap between those who can code and those who may but see it as an activity reserved for geniuses and top-school engineers. Cryptocurrency is not only \"cypherpunk\", it is about inclusion and this kind of messages are not helping us get more hands to work on the repos. If you want more cypherpunk, help us get more people contributing with the project or start coding yourself.\n\nThis is not about you pointing out what this proposal lacks or should improve. This is about the tone.","signature":"92308b63c1ad547bc53e6df6423a81d97d6f681d9799a330fdcb4f26b2b016077d9123aa7a9b2deb433ff7348548d587c5312025e91f16f75973b5c9ff74e901","publickey":"78d8ff0b05d20c593ab45a2ff3d55dd61b421bc599585e6c5cc2e409947dd950","commentid":"2","receipt":"a8062d2c8ce52567d775f1e15a2462d1acb9b657619715a05f4be72d159b2882f01437ce40452a4301a24f4bf606983443df4a667f66e00b2fc2408f82290109","timestamp":1585004706,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
