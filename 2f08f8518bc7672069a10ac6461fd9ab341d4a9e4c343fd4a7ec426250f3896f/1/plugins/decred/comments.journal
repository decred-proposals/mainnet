I would have said: do you know that TV show, \"Shark tank\"?  Well it's like that, except there are thousands of sharks instead of just 5 sharks, and the sharks are really not sharks, but an assortment of seafood, plankton, some carp and trouts, and then a massive, 200 tonne, 25m massive blue whale in the middle.  It's so massive that it bends spacetime around itself.  It's a thing to behold I tell ya\n\nSo I began to appreciate the entertainment aspect of Politeia more.   \"Honk, honk!\" \n\nAs for your proposal, it's a time of crisis now, so we will all need cartoons to keep us jolly and give that inner warmth we all need during these difficult times.  I cannot think of something more important than cartoons during times of hardship actually.  I don't see you providing metrics, and I see Instagram has cca 90 followers.  I imagine it's the same DCR people you see in \"our\" comms that like and follow these, but who cares about boring metrics.  I know this stuff is viral and let's forget about stats. Life is more than metrics and stats. Life is art.  I begin to see life more and more from an Oscar Gamboe perspective.\n\nI like it, my only criticism is the price. I think $1350 for a comic is way undervalued. I would urge you to edit it to at least $2999. Listen, the Treasury coffers are full, we need to spend them some way.  Hiphop, cartoons, taking selfies in pubs and claling it an  'event', google/facebook ads, this is the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and undoubtedly also Tacotime.  Tacotime would be proud of what we've built, a vibrant commune.  This is cypherpunk and what crypto is all about.  \n\nBack to the Proposal, you say it takes 9h of work to upload it to social media, I'd say make that number higher, take your time... it's covid, we all stay home longer and have more time.  Make it at least 19h. \n\nI'll support this but only if you ask for more, at this absurdly low price I don't have the heart to support it, it would feel like we're stealing from you, and I'm no thief.\n\n","signature":"8d11a28e8782405e6ba94e75f79fdb7e263f572fb30b10184a7dc822cf04f19b25eb2d45a8e9d58c235895335a8251b3a43118807a5be548caa3cdbb80f75b09","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"8c112275f2027daeb76d343c5b852e6f214d8064dca0973466c92178516501da233784cb1074eb714b1db5c477c7faed53993239340e576e73271f66ec957505","timestamp":1585000674,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
