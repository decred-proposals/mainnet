RFP: Decred Designated Market Maker


# Prelude

It has become evident that we may have jumped the gun soliciting proposals from market makers before getting buy-in from the stakeholders.  This proposal seeks to rectify that with a vote on whether or not we should potentially engage a market maker, and should it fail to pass none of the already submitted MM proposals will go to a vote.

# Background

I began the search for a market maker in January 2018 by talking to some of the more well-known firms in the space and picking their brains on the particularities of the cryptocurrency market making process. Engaging a MM had been (and still is) one of the main things that large institutional players would like to see from the project on the usability front (the other two being a high-quality custodian that supports staking and more listings).

It was immediately obvious when talking to firms that the standard way of doing business was not compatible with Decred.  NDAs needed to be signed, huge amounts of cryptocurrency would need to be lent, and there was little or no room for oversight.  Exposing the treasury to lending risk was a non-starter, and contrary to how things work in other markets, in crypto inventory is provided by the party hiring the MM.

Fast forward a year and crypto winter has made many players in the space more malleable and conducive to negotiation.  Decred has also continued to attract some of the smartest investors in the space who are all keen to see our liquidity situation improve.  At the beginning of this year, Chris Burniske and I rebooted the effort to find a MM and he compiled a list of new targets that we began to vet.  This dovetailed with work that Max Bronstein had started this summer and we eventually merged our efforts.

# Why?

Much has been written about the illiquidity of Decred and hypotheses for its state range from the particularities of the hybrid PoW/PoS system to the reluctance of holders who are not staking to leave their coins on an exchange.  Regardless of this, it goes without saying that a coin targeting the store of value (SoV) market needs to reduce entry and exit friction as much as possible in order to build market confidence. Likewise, greater market stability will be conducive to more broad usage of DCR as a medium of exchange (MoE).


Here are a couple of real-world examples of what a MM can do for DCR's usability as a MoE as well as how it can encourage greater liquidity by attracting a larger number of market participants:

Imagine you want to sell me your used car for $5k and I offer to pay you in DCR.  If I pay you with DCR using the last print as the price and your immediately selling that DCR would result in you receiving $4.5k that would not be a great offer.  Having a MM there to absorb your sell order very close to the last trade price significantly enhances the user experience, and you get your $5k.

Likewise, if you were a Decred contractor and had some DCR you needed to sell every month to pay your rent and expenses it wouldn't be great if you put in a market order and the price dropped 5%+.

What having greater depth on the order books does is build market confidence as people can get in and out more easily without causing significant volatility with small trade sizes.  Traders are also able to immediately mark their position to market and don't have to worry about "nothing but air" if they try and sell.

In essence, the stakeholders would be socializing the cost of a better market experience for all DCR users and traders.

You can think of it this way; a MM is going to do for the price chart of Decred what the new stake difficulty algorithm did for the ticket price chart.
It will not suspend market forces, it will smooth them and improve UX.

# What?

The broad parameters that each MM was given as guidance in our talks were to target a 2% bid to ask spread or better and provide a minimum of USD 30k of depth both on the buy and sell-side.  They were also asked to service a broad array of crosses on leading exchanges.

What we are expressly not doing is soliciting a firm to engage in the types of market behavior that is unethical and ineffective for our purposes, namely; wash trading, spoofing, or the myriad of other gimmicks that are employed to feign market health by other currencies.

Each proposal will have a few components to the final cost:

* Setup: The fees that are charged to onboard with the MM.
* Base: Comprised of what the firm will charge per cross on which they make a market.
* Inventory: The amount they will need to pay in borrow cost to acquire the necessary inventory for their operations.
* Exchange fees: The projected ceiling for the amount in fees that the MM expects to incur in any given month.

Proposals that go to a vote should have a clear breakdown of all the fees listed above which apply to their proposal as well as the total quoted in USD as the projected monthly cap for their operations.  Any cost overruns will need to be born by the proposer.

Furthermore, I would suggest the following:

* Each deal should have a total monthly cost (including all items enumerated above) which does not exceed USD 60k.
* In the event this RFP passes narrowly it would behoove all proposers to have an alternate scaled-back offer that reduces the breadth, depth, and/or crosses and hits a price point in the USD 30k range monthly.

# Who?

We had narrowed our list down to four firms that we felt would do a good job should the stakeholders engage them. Of those four, three have submitted proposals and one backed out at the last minute.

The three contenders are:

* [Grapefruit Trading](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b)
* [i2 Trading](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9)

Each has already begun engaging with the community and ideally, the process of integrating stakeholder feedback will result in the strongest possible offers being put up for final consideration.

# How?

In most cases, there is a traditional legal entity such as a corporation or a foundation backing a cryptocurrency.  Most of these entities are awash in their native token because as we know, projects that are the result of ICOs where tokens are issued capriciously and have no actual incremental cost of production can just "print money".  So a centralized entity can easily provide a MM with millions of dollars of tokens with which to go about their task of stimulating liquidity.

In some cases with currencies that have limited issuance and no discretionary funds to deploy it is often a group of large investors that might undertake the hiring of a firm to provide liquidity services.  Since Decred was created with the foresight to build a sustainable funding mechanism into the project one of the two main hurdles to hiring a MM is eliminated.  Furthermore, we have been fortunate enough to have Alternity Capital, a large Decred PoW miner, offer to supply the inventory for these operations and eliminate the second hurdle, namely inventory risk.  They are underwriting the risk of lending their coins and suffering the opportunity cost of reduced staking (however they are being compensated for the lost income) in order to facilitate the process. The terms of that loan will be included in each proposal.

# When?

Now.  Should this RFP pass (thus signaling stakeholder willingness to consider hiring a MM) the proposals that have been submitted will go up for a vote when ready, and should one of them pass the submitter will be hired.  In the event that multiple proposals pass, that which receives the greatest support will be declared the winner.

**TL;DR:** This vote is to decide if we should move the process of exploring the engagement of a market maker forward.
