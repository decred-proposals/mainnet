At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  \n\nThat said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.\n\nLast, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.  This is something we can learn from and it is better that a situation like this happens sooner than later.

The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.\n\nNot counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.\n\nI do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.\n\n-Solar","signature":"5355906c02d337af487b481aa3d9fa3885090174577d6d48c4e9530123ada2065cedb0427af361b58365447e7ab4196e6757fc8265b274a35b65a7f23aa9cc0d","publickey":"561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327","commentid":"16","receipt":"b650eefa989a8e91e95b66c894e6481caad4e2351ac84150bd572498818766657f76dedb6204481950190edde4822191f203e5ac4d7a4de36e0ea15cb1148306","timestamp":1565490616,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We're talking about an amount of depth that would amount to a rounding error for a large player were they to accumulate a DCR position. This will really have more impact for small traders and those wishing to use DCR in transactions. For bigger players that build positions over time it will help to smooth the oscillations that we often see in the market.","signature":"0c18e59da7d887b7b2a4c2f45cdd4956e03309f18122f0116b40b84251c170bf9f76ed9c389edb6188451401cae79b579f9ef96e1ce7f26fd8a4db6fd6a11b03","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"17","receipt":"3254e66db1abea4a63884626d1f0f8636694e748d075dbb748cf906625784ce74ce80211a2fb7333071a944dbd2b9a794c6b48a7bb90544d5d0dd177a47ba502","timestamp":1565491039,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
