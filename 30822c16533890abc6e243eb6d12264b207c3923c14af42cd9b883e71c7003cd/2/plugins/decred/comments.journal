At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  \n\nThat said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.\n\nLast, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.  This is something we can learn from and it is better that a situation like this happens sooner than later.

The acceptance of a **PAID Market Maker Service** is very concerning to me.  I believe that a yes vote will lead to an inquiry from regulators.  Any inquiry from the regulators will cost millions in legal fees, and will likely drain the treasury.  I am wondering how many programmers will be willing to work for free.  \n\nJZ - stated earlier that that the liquidity is for small traders. However, most traders are not going to move Decred more than 1%, so how does the community benefit small traders? Oh, bye the way, payment to a market maker to provide liquidity is the definition of market manipulation.  It does not matter if it is a stock, bond, or commodity.\n\nEvery day Decred naturally adds liquidity to the liquidity pool as blocks are created.  So over time there will be more size and more liquidity. \n Miners are natural sellers and they (provide offers or they hit the bid), since they need to pay for equipment and electricity.\n\nNew listing potential with Coinbase could be derailed if Decred pays for market making as a service.  Why you ask?  Coinbase will need to decide if Decred is a security or not. Paying for market makers as a service will likely put that decision into (no / limbo category).  Poloniex has already Geo-Fenced Decred in the US due to regulatory uncertainty.  The ethos of the entire community is being put to the test. \n\n**I vote NO** to any and all Paid Market Markers as a Service.","signature":"b9cf8480043b0bf8fc9f86a3a55631a3bbad57e03257e4b67f5030818fa369c596d4ca463a180cd6a37a2fe2a48664a71041a0176e7f981c61eb152dc728760a","publickey":"528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","commentid":"18","receipt":"7d06cbf3a51effa6e3fe6e37d82c8fc2f461d618bed4658a75b5a45bf9dbcfcccafc22a0b90e3d62d22d802efd9ef4773cd2e276e8919c6ddc47db1fe46cb70a","timestamp":1565496725,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And priced at $12k per month, which would cover 2x half-time personnel?\n\nThe capital for running the MM function isn't even being provided by the MM (it is being loaned by a miner and paid for by the Treasury), so the MM doesn't have a cost of tying up capital.  I don't see what other expense they are bearing other than time and materials?\n\nWhy can't MMs come to the table with the same 'fight club' mentality that characterizes the rest of the Decred contractor community and prove they can add value before asking for professional comp levels?\n\nPersonally, I think this current batch of proposals should all be voted down, and the MMs should sharpen their pencils and come back to the table with  proposals with a scope and timeline designed to actually serve as an \"experiment\" and with pricing that basically reflects an attitude of \"please give us a chance to cover our costs and prove ourselves.\"","signature":"1cedad9ef022bb37e3f972e31795851db6010a4a069010676bb51b343415d2b6444f63887d7d7fbfb7cfd4e617ee456600fc2e977072392334150e2c2e21f707","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"19","receipt":"0137837f4bb2abd4afea62a2ac323d1ff66d3f3db4cddef08a28ae708a429f9eaef02701e509fd3fb8e905a44913aed0f97b9510c9ae6ea853015739a3704d0a","timestamp":1565497205,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I mean, if we've solved the order book liquidity problem, and there truly is pent up interest to buy and sell, then avg. daily trading volume should clearly rise.  \n\nIf avg. daily trading volume doesn't rise w/ the buy and sell walls showing up, then we can conclude that the real problem is a lack of interest to participate in the market, and not the lack of order book liquidity.\n\nIf there is no interest to participate in the market, they paying a MM to setup buy and sell walls to increase order book liquidity is a wasted expense.\n\n+++\n\nMy hypothesis as to Decred's lack of liquify and volume is as follows:\n   - the core community is very strong, like a cult, and they are all staking, but it is a cult that is operationally incompetent, and can't figure out how to market itself\n   - since the general market hasn't really heard about the project the participation rate from typical run of the mill traders and speculators is abysmal \n   - Decrd's market awareness scores 1 out of 10 versus Bitcion's 10 out of 10;  see:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US\u0026q=decred,litecoin,bitcoin%20cash\n\nAnyways, running a MM experiment should help us to understand better which of the two problems we have (a) lack of order book liquidity, or (b) general lack of awareness about the project.  If we run the MM experiment and average daily trading volume rises, we can conclude we have problem (a) and the MM proposal fixes it.

Decred either **IS** or **ISN'T** a security. A paid market maker service will not make it tip one way or the other.\n\nIf you believe Decred is a security, no current exchange should have listed it or should trade it. The implications would be major and we should all rethink our participation in this project and the implications of doing so. \n\nIf Decred isn't a security the regulation you refer to doesn't apply at all and you are suggesting to vote no based on unrelated information.\n\nNobody is currently in position to say definitively if Decred is or isn't a security  because current regulation is incomplete and purposely vague regarding CC. What we can do however is use the SEC framework, past comments and existing laws regarding traditional security assets and  apply it to Decred to make an educated Guess.\n\nMy personal conclusion in this regard is that Decred is most probably not a security  (or at least, that hundreds of projects are quite a lot more at risk of being securities well before we even begin to consider Decred to be a security) I believe that major definitions of what are securities would need to be changed before that happens.  Thus personally, I will act and consider Decred not a security, unless an official regulatory statement is made and say it explicitly is.\n\nPoloniex geofencing Decred,  while adding,trading and promoting an ICO at the same time should be enough convince anyone that their action have nothing to do with fear of regulations. Just like you should not make your decision based on coinbase's decision to consider Decred for listing either.","signature":"51937fde84400fbff6f2a6466f18dd38e79bf131d7ad6aab014b5da9aad882f689361ab63e2e98a5fa20678c2f33e24ee2e90ada5094a9ec605e6a50909b050e","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"21","receipt":"67741275354aaf2dd6131c1039841b07f49d56ac067f26e93533fb231b9a0ce617ce3e6c3dfa030d7fca3e2ea1aefb266ad4b87c7da2094763cbccfe09b4890f","timestamp":1565532255,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We as a distributed mind of stakeholders must make an assessment to the best of our ability given the information which is available to us.

We are not seeing this play out in the market.\n\nWe must remember that we are pioneering a new was of organisation here.

We first need to find out and establish some relation between providing liquidity and increase in volume and if possible whether there is a demand for liquidity or not. Although i would rather have free market take its course but here are some things that we as a community should ask for if these proposals are to going to be voted on. These are all suggestions, not demands, please show your support or disapproval via comment votes and replies if you (dis)agree with a specific point.Feel free to extend this list in replies to this comment:\n\n- **Cost** - It must be similar to other heads of expenditures, which from cursory research seem to be around $20-30k/month or lower.\n- **Transparency** - One of the contributors (jz being a good candidate) should have at least view only access to trading operations of MM. Also whatever proof that would be provided if a regulator or court asked to prove no unethical practices are happening should be available to the community as well, in form of monthly reports(?).\n- **Opt-out clause** - It should be possible to terminate the contract if desired results are not visible in 3 months with review happening every 3 months.\n- **DEX** - Option to add DEX pairs when it launches.\n\nMy main motivation to consider a MM at this moment in time is to get research data and finding out with some degree of certainty that introducing liquidity on order books leads to better market interest. Other than that my suggestions are an attempt to reduce strain on treasury and achieve transparency/accountability and reduce need for trust.","signature":"6947bd514c921d70d094886d9075f008d91c6a1d8ae8cf7d5ed33e1078f1f4da0dad3dcc0172682374a600975ffa311cf89bcc33bbabcfd59aa6567a2a25810d","publickey":"98cf480835aabf91c43c2913db1849d0c80b947f1fe1392804150a633582a84f","commentid":"24","receipt":"b559b818a8ca979b704737679b3b9541f5fe715a077f133f57ab5b2a5b1beb6d42160bb640cd29ba7bb0747e21c90482defc730dd66c5fd452932745557c2007","timestamp":1565541837,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Decred needs some sort of an engine to kick-start trading of an asset that has a massive hodling properties. Great problem to have tbh) But I understand the market and its a very mean place! In reality when an asset has a great value roughly 10%(possibly even less) of all circulation that is on the exchanges defines the price. So when a majority 90% is hodling for the long term the minority which are day traders and speculators define/discover the price short/middle term. Exposing themselves to a much greater risks when in short term or swing positions. Im 100% in favor of MM coming to generate day trading.\n\n-Im on a fence from ethical POV. Lack of clarity on mechanics of how MMs work with order book and inventory stops me from making a confident and well informed choice. I understand algos can not be disclosed. But a bit more detailed understanding beyond over-generalized idea of how MMs provide liquidity would be very helpful. Hopefully MMs can clarify that part.","signature":"7da383ebbcf87faa2a7a40fdaa2560315e8c0ffbb856d960638ea1830809eedc3fa872a3d65ce48c7d97546dab6d54a1caf605552e5802da6c5ac326d73e4b01","publickey":"f72039032f4b6e6ff2bbb9655c1859c195d143af330af2910c43f237d494ec8d","commentid":"25","receipt":"7f943fb4be568296f193af5abe2a48df7cdabeeb4fab06675babe8e42162bd75a29f2b3108f7d1c0d7c0f9dc371fc194995da9ee046e484e5c9e181feed32405","timestamp":1565583152,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I tend to go off of the decentralization requirement those was used with Eth, it is decentralized enough to not be a security. I have very little to no concern Decred will ever be labeled a security. \n\n2- DCR has no liquidity. None. I can’t even sell 10 DCR at times without moving the stinking market a little. In order to attract more attention to Decred then we must have liquidity. Will you provide it by placing your DCR, BTC, USD up on the order books? I will not.\n\n3- Concerns of wash trading and manipulation. I think it is possible to detect if these activities are taking place. I would like to see a clause added that would end the contract if detected.\n\nMy bottom line is that market makers are needed for Decred to advance where we all know it should be. I will be voting accordingly and giving my support for the MM proposal to IterativeCap. Vote for what you feel is in YOUR best interest.\n\nI am not happy i had to spend any Decred to make this comment. What can i say, I love my DCR. But there will come a time when everyone wants to exit or increase their position. As the market stands now, its not possible unless you OTC. For people like me, with not nearly enough Decred to use OTC trading, a MM would be a tremendous help. \n\nLike it or not these are my thoughts.

The discourse so far has been extremely healthy and both sides bring valid points to the table. My comments will hopefully illuminate why we thought it was prudent to work with an MM as well as clarify some of the misconceptions that are being brought up.\n\nThe need for an MM quickly arose as I began speaking with a number of institutional investors here in Silicon Valley. While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment. Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure. Similarly, investors have to weigh current liquidity in their research as a measure of sentiment and demand. \n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean that MMs are being brought in to help the wealthy, it is merely institutions who have been most vocal about the problem. The lack of liquidity affects investors big and small, and it seems like contracts are the most affected as they actually have to liquidate DCR to pay their bills. Not having liquidity + constant sell pressure from contractors and miners forces the price down and does not instill confidence within the broader market. \n\nAnother driving factor in our pursuit was the fact that an asset positioned to capture the SoV market needs liquidity. If an asset isn’t investable, I.e. liquid enough for investors to move in/out of, it can’t compete with other SoV contenders in the market. If you look back at Chris Burniske’s work on the institutional investors case for BTC, he notes that inevitability is one of the hall marks of any asset, and as such, we must prioritize DCR’s liquidity if we expect it to be an SoV. This issue is particularly exacerbated by the fact the DCR has such a high stake rate. \n\nIn terms of cost, something that should be stressed is that everything is malleable. Costs aren’t fixed, and we prompted the MMs to create proposals that were flexible so that stakeholders could decide the appropriate number of crosses, market depth, uptime, etc. $30,000 within 2% on each side seemed enough to facilitate retail investors moving in/out of positions with ease, but my understanding is that the MMs are willing to make this number $50k or even $15k, it all really depends on what we think is best. \n\nLastly, and we’ve stated this before, but all of the firms chosen to submit proposals are high quality firms with a lot of reputational skin in the game. For context, Altonomy just raised a large financing round from Polychain Capital, Grapefruit Trading was started by the former founder of Cumberland, and i2 has been a crypto OTC desk for a long time and active DCR stakeholder. We only engaged firms who’s values line up with those shared by DCR stakeholders.","signature":"5ad5f79ad19aaaf06f72b8725c9822c3ef3d2a5151f1fb046ac6ac6f33869b52f37b77b3d03052b75beb633c62c7522f37579642c4f88079c1029c706fdbd00a","publickey":"107a5db445996608df8bd7cecfb6b3e41d74fd6c659916becb4e54167849a96e","commentid":"29","receipt":"6bc98d749769293faedb6c805eb521cf8a1816e1309e35271c025b523621d0e28b6a82bddc736a311b38361df14d3abf2d1ff0de26b712398db2807b2a841609","timestamp":1565646704,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In BTC or XMR, for example, the only cost's associated with keeping funds locked up in orders is the potential for losing funds due to exchange issues, but in DCR, you also give up potential earnings on PoS rewards.\n\nThe other main portion of your sovereignty lost when locking up DCR in orders on-exchange is the ability to vote and have a say in the future of Decred as a whole.\n\nBecause of these two reasons, owners of DCR are incentivized _not_ to provide any liquidity, as it ultimately costs them much more than on standard PoW chains. As such, I believe paying a MM a small portion of the treasury income is a great middle ground, and an excellent way to keep all of the benefits of staking DCR, while also being able to increase liquidity of DCR across the board.\n\nThe key here to me is that we, as stakeholders of Decred, can guide the MM process all the way through, and ultimately shut it down if it fails and or turns out to be unnecessary.\n\nTl;dr -- Because of PoS drastically reducing liquidity and increasing costs associated with keeping DCR locked up in orders on-exchange, a paid MM is a great thing to explore.","signature":"a85e41b64cc05b75ceeafe89c194ce1bb0fb764118deefbb367579dbae22b1fbdae04b160faca8b2b876a10c6ac301922eb19bcf206eff10ae75d3c1e523480f","publickey":"18f6cb98e06dfd5153ccafc105e7b6ab812bcd1ac71b62829060cf49670ea791","commentid":"34","receipt":"e5bf371b62ba8b7ced02085bdd57f5c1d19c49b082290482484afc9aba655c13c87b1fd56128d2c48ae180639186efdbdefcbdd4eb9ba3ecd9f2ebe3b368c90b","timestamp":1565701918,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I plan to write a more in-depth post about the benefits of liquidity to the value of an asset (particularly as it relates to cryptocurrencies). \n\nUntil that time here is some related reading: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/country/illiquidity.pdf \n\nI generally believe that creating liquidity at various pricing levels will attract traders to the asset -\u003e who create additional organic liquidity (and volume). With the increased liquidity and volumes, the asset will become available to a new class of investors, particularly institutional investors with strict liquidity requirements in their holdings. Where today, even if these investors had an interest in Decred, would be barred or limited in the size of holding due to the lack of liquidity available today.\n\nAll in, I think it's crucial to drive liquidity to the asset and it's a matter of the community determining the best manner in which to do so.","signature":"9f03455b22ed3cd2078e686e5431ff8b05e779d7505a162242466ce6e1ece6a3e530bf79df175a92224f634932734e1ef1b0145bc0b3b8d5d06a03e4b426b505","publickey":"e11726f552ac8d51728f3f945d2221f81add1a445cfcd0bdd211ad7b3d04c933","commentid":"36","receipt":"6c86dbd793373f588e350489164935565c323d5eea4b666b829ae81a279f263ec678981ecdfba9dc0806f736c46d2abe58b38ed1d04ad97f1ae994c78e93e608","timestamp":1565718003,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

More you explain it, more it looks like treasury paying to hasten the entry or exit of II.\n\nThis is probably a temporary problem as incentives shift with lower inflation and hobbyist stakers go back to trading. also if and when this prolonged bear market goes away and regulatory uncertainty reduces, more people would be willing to trade.\n\nStill i just want to do this experiment in case it does kick start this process early and my suggestion is for as much transparency as possible and range of $20-30k/month.

If all top coins in cryptospace hiring them doesnt mean its the right way to go. Communities of those coins never being asked what ppl think about hiring them. Decred does it the first time and other projects will use it as a reference in the future. Pretty cool!) \nIMO cryptocurrencies should not hire DMMs. Market makers must remain neutral from what they market make and ONLY crypto exchanges should bring them on the market or they market make themselves for profit. Traditional exchanges do allow companies to pay MMs for market making as well. A company is not a currency tho but I think its nonsense as well. I dont think a cryptocurrency paying for market making from a treasury publicly or by any other crypto foundation behind closed doors is a right way.

It pointed out this risk factor you mention in terms of Decred falling under securities regulation if it participates in creating a market/supporting a market for Decred. My article agrees with your fears and validates your argument, there is a risk here. \nBut in my opinion the risk is worth taking for multiple reasons. The first is that the SEC is currently going after much bigger and easier fish then Decred (KIN). They do not have the resources or manpower to go after every project that may or may not be a security. Secondly, they are focusing on ICO tokens for the most part. Third, because of how the Decred project is implementing this MM, by this very RFP, and by through seeking stakeholder consent first with politeia, we have a much stronger defensible position in case of regulatory intervention. If this decision were unilaterally implemented by the directors of the Decred holdings group, we would have issues. But that is not the case here. Fourth, the SEC is one regulator of one country. Decred is a worldwide project. Fifth, even if we do receive a penalty from the SEC against the Decred treasury, we could potentially vote on whether to pay or not (that be a strange proposal). Furthermore, we may be able to decentralize the treasury funds control away from Decred Holdings Group LLC before they are able to compel that entity to pay a penalty. However, this could mean the directors of the LLC could still be on the hook in the worst case. But in the best-case scenario, we could point to the now decentralized treasury as proof that Decred is no longer a security (Ethereum did something similar).\nwe should not ask for permission, but forgiveness. The spirit of cypherpunks has never been that of cowering in fear of regulatory reprisal, or to ask for permission to write code. We should not seek it now here either.","signature":"4e34d5a24ef213edd05c4e5e1e95207a8f1622a050e4343ff01d82afc5101fd700f5d19093f7ca479753d7ae87b5afe589d29c44ab04a6d671036f8539745100","publickey":"7be2e523007f116ac22e0d04a715c0ff4e7834d0b85cd656577730efd10a2281","commentid":"44","receipt":"059ef23a7a59815c5af482694467cc5a2f6585aaef9924dc24dc5a41c26f10b5d5fb2702186c694bfd3c45928ecd8795a28bf30487d87532c5a6c64d3eb6c708","timestamp":1565896009,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

At this point would it not be cheaper to add 2-3% to the amount of decred the contractors are due? I understand that this also has to do with decred as a medium of exchange.

RFP being done after the fact despite it being discussed prior to MM proposals showing up.\n2. RFP voting start date was revealed even before proposal was up on Pi. I saw 100s of tickets being bought 2 days before voting started on this proposals. I can't say and am not saying that there was some kind of internal fixing, but knowledge of voting start date certainly allowed someone to stock up on tickets. This has been intentionally avoided other than admins knowing when vote will start. This \"looks\" bad imo.\n3. Proposal was not updated with proposed amendments suggested in comments and my comment and some others were even left unaddressed despite getting some upvotes.\n4. There is continuous talk of how opposition is only a vocal minority, which very well might be true in terms of voting, but i think valid concerns and reasonable amendments should be acknowledged and included regardless. It could be a unorganized majority of many which we need to encourage to join the discussion. This is necessary for decentralization.\n\nIn summary whole process looked very rushed, hap hazard and somewhat heavy handed. After 1.5 years of behind the scene work, why is there need to complete this in only 4 days of wider discussion. I wonder if this is going to be bulldozed through because majority supports it or they have the votes despite some valid concerns being raised. I hope that ethics and morals that we so dearly value in this community are kept in mind by the majority when making any decision.\n\nI would like to repeat my belief that no matter how strong a technical/incentive system you develop, it is not going to work w/o the ethical and moral underpinnings and community curation that has been the hallmark of decred.\n\nYou are free to agree or disagree with me and write scathing or supporting replies or call me names/mock me or encourage me but this left a bad test in my mouth.","signature":"40e70440f80edcc319804fcdd6904f2d998ec4f7b228800195de2932bd4e11ca807497d13262def0a0c7965216cbb106128fa32264b3405ad0e9059d74d70b01","publickey":"98cf480835aabf91c43c2913db1849d0c80b947f1fe1392804150a633582a84f","commentid":"49","receipt":"e00e126ef8eb4aa16e407547a14a0e243020afb6f7a4542719bcd5ce5149f293be27a6d4ab2f2ad3176e3f30170d93d85c5c63cce68497d30fab9659c116610d","timestamp":1566057027,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment\"\n\n- Why big buyers can not get a position thru OTC? Isnt what OTC trading for? Call i2. Check their inventory. Buy) \n\n\" Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure\"\n\n- From what i see now is that the most liquid assets on biggest exchange binance behave worse than less liquid assets on smaller exchanges.

The speed at which a proposal progresses, in terms of comments and voting, is entirely up to the proposer, and they risk a proposal not being approved by moving it too quickly between these stages.\n\nIt is interesting to see you attempt to frame this discussion as a question of ethics.  Considering this discussion has nothing to do with human rights of various sorts, I fail to see how it is reasonable to ascribe ethics to the activities of a MM.  You might consider enlisting a MM to be a bad idea, but to claim it is unethical is a huge stretch, IMO.","signature":"72fada9947b9f8b40005122031f64aad8cecaa397fce29426b9f98049fc0fe6872d16dfceeb8f14fa8993fa135cea4839be2dc38ea6fbff6afac1d299e009704","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"52","receipt":"fb7f3adf573b207a0b67f68dad3ca3a4f739040920e8a9ecb93f8328f25996a420906c48b96958b9e46c89c4c3fe4a08031c700a326dcdacff4da4120f0de609","timestamp":1566059187,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As i and others have said  reasonable price and checks and balances are needed as this kind of activity is prone to misuse and requires trust, which i am proposing to minimize.\n\nThis is the exact reason why i bring in ethics and morals as these concerns need to be addressed to prevent drain on treasury and unethical behavior at expense of it. Also, this seems absolutely incorrect time to do this as its maximum drain on treasury and someone can acquire large stake more easily at expense of treasury thus centralizing the supply.\n\nAs i said incentives do not always work or can be misaligned in absence of transparency, so we have to fall back on doing ethically/morally right thing to do. I believe, me airing my concerns is just that.\n\nAlthough there is no obligation to incorporate the views of minority, it would be ethical/wise to do so if those concerns are logical and valid.

The point is, an MM will be paid by the Treasury which might or might not be an AP.

Let's speak numbers:\n\nPR had cost $120-150K for 6 months. 2 proposals were published Oct 20-21 and went to vote Oct 29. It was coordinated behind the scenes, it was poorly announced via the tiny #proposals room and felt rushed. Lessons were learned: we realized that we need RFP process for such cases and to significantly improve announcement campaigns. We also discussed [longer discussion periods](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/117) for bigger budgets.\n\nDEX had cost $250K for estimated 6 months. This was the best handling of large expense so far. Concept was introduced as early as [June 2018](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) so everybody had enough time to digest it. [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) was published Feb 4 and allowed a ton of discussion. I had enough time to [reflect](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/dex/analysis-bee.md) on all pros and cons. Once the discussion mostly died down it went to vote Mar 5. I think 2-3 weeks would be fine, but 1 full month didn't hurt at all.\n\nFast forward through DEX spec, [DEX dev](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1) adjusted the cost to $230K and time to ~1 year. Published Aug 7 and vote started Aug 12 - but that's okay because everybody had a ton of time to sync up.\n\nMM proposals have cost $250-300K for 6 months. 3 proposals published Aug 7, RFP published Aug 10, RFP vote started Aug 15. This is a _new_ topic to debate formally and just one week for up to $300K?\n\nI don't know about others, but for me the need for MMs is even less obvious than PR or DEX. I do want to dive in, educate myself, understand why it costs so much and make the best vote choice, but it takes time.\n\nSince this is just an RFP, there is still time to learn and discuss before the real ones go to vote. I hope they won't be rushed like this.","signature":"87084e9e6001f32ae77145d185ee6e6727f81144e320b0490331ec180b01f8d5e291c298ba05e2d41b979cb7d0c35e4e3a63285e4e777bb614df19258774bc0a","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"55","receipt":"cb5c3093d7f4bc253e8b0ad09d1d1814d1fc8d3934a47424d6e6ad13c8d9a7da81e97098d8fe85baa192afb906b6b69d96db044659f9ff11323de8f7d4d4cd0b","timestamp":1566076714,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don't fully understand how MM works but I need to vote. Chances are my case is not alone and highlights the importance of preliminary educational campaign in direct voting systems.\n\n**Questions: how does it work?**\n\nI heard in traditional markets exchanges are the ones who fund market makers. Exchanges are in a unique position to audit MM's work because they have full access to all trade data. Why this should be any different in crypto?\n\nDo all coins pay for market making?\n\nDo any crypto exchanges pay for market making like they should?\n\nWhile trading on a retail exchange I learned that you can get burned. In rare events you can get burned _heavily_ and _quickly_ and never sell/buy back.\n\nWhat are the failure modes in the worst cases, who will take the damage in case of a \"black swan\" event at the exchange? E.g. if a huge dump or margin/stop-loss collapse, or if the exchange gets hacked?\n\nHow MMs handle bull runs? Bear runs? e.g. if their DCR sell side is fully bought out and the price never falls back (it will mean a ton of DCR was sold cheaply). Conversely, if the BTC buy side is fully sold into and the price crashes without recovery.\n\nIf MM is confident that they can provide liquidity without burning money, why can't they use their own money?\n\nWhy \"just placing buy and sell orders\" cost so much? What makes it so expensive? Isn't it semi-automated?

Is 70% Yes from 20% eligible tickets a better result than 60% Yes from 30% tickets?\n\nGreatest percentage support but obviously must meet quorum.\n\n\u003eWill there be a legal contract with the MM? If yes, what entity will be on Decred's side?\n\nNo, the final Pi proposal will be the agreement. They will have a lending agreement with Alternity but there's nobody in charge on our side with the authority to sign deals on behalf of the project.\n\n\u003eIn case the MM manages to make profit during his activity, will it go back to Treasury or make a discount for the next month?\n\nGreat question, we can negotiate this but since I'm not willing to share in potential losses they may incur it's probably not acceptable for them to share profit. They will not be making a market with the intention of having net profits though.\n\n\u003eWill stakeholders have control of which exchange to provide liquidity with? In particular, could we ask the MM to deploy it on our DEX?\n\nOur DEX will not likely be ready before a 6 month deal expires but when it does if we decided to renew a deal DEX MM could be a stipulation.\nThe crosses/exchanges that have been selected have been chosen for strategic reasons. We can get into those in more depth in the comments of those props. We also need flexibility so if we get any major listings during the 6 month engagement we can switch to operating where we feel it would have the greatest impact.","signature":"370f7e58eff32b8b193146de06531ed9b98b285876240024efaf9bf20a237078e44d0db2e488e8c7a40ffcc076b34b6eba8fa9f16aeed27e93cdd6d14220160f","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"63","receipt":"b228da23357da920c8f7597c321db24e55bb5b2b1c58043060ef66a73a0cc860540033a7d762002b08a1cffc251618dc54ead682966951e48539b3960f617907","timestamp":1566171664,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We have very little data for comps.\n\n\u003eDoes a period of MM have any long term effect, i.e. if we decide to stop it after 6 months, will we return back to our thin books situation?\n\nYes while active the MM will make for a more orderly market and encourage people who would have otherwise not taken a DCR position to feel comfortable dipping their toes in the water.\n\n\u003eDon't we simply have low liquidity for other reasons? e.g. the sell side is lacking simply because the price is wrong, and it will wake up at a higher price. Or the buy side is thin because of the general lack of interest/awareness like noted here?\n\nYou are correct that price fixes everything. Part of the problem is nobody want to be the person that makes the price rise sharply. A MM helps to smooth this process.\n\n\u003eIf we are talking about institutional players, why not provide this liquidity via OTC instead? I guess OTCs have less custody risk than retail exchanges? Do institutional investors use retail exchanges at all?\n\nDCR is actually well traded OTC but MM would have less impact there, large players transact in size and the types of support we're talking about would be a rounding error on a typical OTC trade.\n\n\u003eIsn't it good that the big boys are not entering? Isn't it better to have DCR distributed across lots and lots of small fish?\n\nAmusingly enough the groups that have been most vocal about engaging a MM are larger players who are mostly done buying and want the market to be less scary for small players to enter and exit.\n\n\u003eP.S. I do realize my reasoning may be flawed in multipe ways. Apologies for silly questions, I am learning to make a better vote choice.\n\nAll legit questions.","signature":"1ee7afacb09e231a3f264ac8a9195ad1f95b2d06ed2978253aedc104116ae54756b886160792669d55e684ca2d2ead388128e3552c6bfa1faa56d9192ae0a206","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"64","receipt":"5eab4105e13dcc6f1d8414408132cf018147c7b5ada2948ff0852dbbd5a1c8fdbd92ec357dac494363a972edc935a6b17dc32971e2a15c774d3b0ec8fa6b0a08","timestamp":1566172095,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think i2 estimated to hit $20k/mo in exchange fees they would need to be doing $20M of volume. That would be a resounding success in my view.\n\n\u003eAny chance we can start small, run it for a few months, read some reports and get a feeling that MM is indeed helpful before ramping up the expenses? Echoing this comment (unreplied as of writing).\n\nYes but we need to balance that with something that can actually be effective and is worth doing for the service provider.\n\n\u003eWhat data will be available to us to audit MM's activity?\n\nYes, addresses in comments a read-only API key has been discussed.\n\n\u003eIs there a dedicated person(s) who will monitor MM activity and ring the bell if anything goes wrong?\n\nThere certainly can be.\n\n\u003eWill someone try to monitor the trades and analyze if MM was the real problem, and not the general lack of interest and market awareness (as suggested in this comment)?\n\nProving causality is always hard, I can just imagine price rallying or falling and people assuming MM is amazing or the devil.

Exchanges are in a unique position to audit MM's work because they have full access to all trade data. Why this should be any different in crypto?\n\nIt shouldn't but the reality is exchanges have the power and don't care about low volume coins.\n\n\u003eDo all coins pay for market making?\n\nI suspect every coin in the top 20 by market cap has MMs operating.\n\n\u003eDo any crypto exchanges pay for market making like they should?\n\nProbably, but likely only for coins like BTC that do tons of volume already.\n\n\u003eWhile trading on a retail exchange I learned that you can get burned. In rare events you can get burned heavily and quickly and never sell/buy back.\n\nMMs will need to manage risk in a way that protects them from major price swings.\n\n\u003eWhat are the failure modes in the worst cases, who will take the damage in case of a \"black swan\" event at the exchange? E.g. if a huge dump or margin/stop-loss collapse, or if the exchange gets hacked?\n\nThe lender bears the risk for the coins lent and the MM bears it for price moves.\n\n\u003eHow MMs handle bull runs? Bear runs? e.g. if their DCR sell side is fully bought out and the price never falls back (it will mean a ton of DCR was sold cheaply). Conversely, if the BTC buy side is fully sold into and the price crashes without recovery.\n\nThey need to buy it back and it would come out of the fees they're charging us if they get put in this position. Essentially they could lose money doing their job.\n\n\u003eIf MM is confident that they can provide liquidity without burning money, why can't they use their own money?\n\nThis isn't directional market making and there's a cost to acquiring the DCR necessary to make the market. In short there are easier places to make money that don't involve complex inventory deals.\n\n\u003eWhy \"just placing buy and sell orders\" cost so much? What makes it so expensive? Isn't it semi-automated? (similar question here)\n\nThe expensive part is the fact that you are potentially incurring small losses and exchange fees. The bids/asks are all spread out in an automated manner.\n\n\u003eDid anybody with legal expertise do a thorough analysis of regulatory concerns raised by jango?\n\nThose concerns do not apply to non-securities. And based on the [SEC's framework](https://www.sec.gov/files/dlt-framework.pdf) as well as a legal opinion I've seen from a reputable law firm with expertise in the space Decred is not likely to ever be considered a security.","signature":"80f3a1c94129415a7f15cfc793217d1204f5b937d89ac3f17d6ab093018efa5a89c78c083b2a2d87dfbfe3c86795b83ffd88fcf4075e854bc0094ef09931e40c","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"66","receipt":"9f4137f320905327d7df5bf9702cedca3627d6c3d9b0c921c79069b0e8d93457e4a7e8123d5a923ca4378eedabd6bfc9f42d3dffd3bd36c2a7bff0b8510ebc07","timestamp":1566173286,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If ppl are against they should be given more time to prepare their case against it. I gave up goin thru studies on this subject coz its very time consuming and 1 week was not enough. IMO MM solution is a double sword edge and JZ with Max did an absolutely beautiful job to bring these props on Pi. Thank you! But id like to see other edge of a sword. Their 1.5 years against 1 week for stakeholders obviously their edge will be sharper) \nI dont think too much trust should be put in MMs either. They say it themselves they can make profit on normies but they will not yada yada. I dont think there is a way to control that without trust involved. Put intermediary to have some sort of control and access to MM log it doesnt change the fact that we should trust this intermediary now) I dont see how one guy can go thru MMs log and simultaneously go thru exchange trx history and get a full picture of MMs activity in a given time to only assure us that MM isnt gaming.
