At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  \n\nThat said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.\n\nLast, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.  This is something we can learn from and it is better that a situation like this happens sooner than later.  Props for retroactively posting this proposal and all the work you have done so far and thank you to the MMs who have already put time and effort into their proposals and discussing them with our community.","signature":"8d6d761ebdd27e4fc728e68ae2377f03de40a126445f5cf17f8db246eb76da85fe7d26aa2da24ffbf83b620900eddda28ee791ab13d8d181dc28782e75419304","publickey":"a38a5b0287e87afb4b5363e1069b20d3abd3d7e98e757a70552753505d38dfd6","commentid":"6","receipt":"f0f7f5c0295d01fad9f3756993abb9aeb79242aadac5e434de238daf6048d44a8ab0fc2e811ddccb46769d257c18cfa5c1651141795efc818c0370731f63fa01","timestamp":1565477695,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I recall the initial process for selecting our PR firm that was somewhat contentious, its yielding dividends now.\n\nWe are all part of a grand experiment.  Iteration is a process of trial and error.  I think this experiment is well worth the try.\n\nI think the proposals thus far have gotten a lot of engagement and we are on the path to getting a final list of proposals that we can vote on.\n\nWhile I think a lot of burden should be placed on Market Makers to provide answers to our questions and refine their proposals, I also think anyone planning to vote should also do some individual DD to make sure they have all the information they need to make a sound decision (which ever way they actually vote).  Some independent research on google would be a good idea.\n\nI come from an econ and equities background so I'm pretty clear on the value proposition of Market Making done right, and how vital it is for supporting liquidity and free flowing markets.","signature":"b66f9e6e6c1b520921f290a181b140c3c477b42e47a7eabb333d6e35bc6132b3035b1109f0072d47c04ef096abab86d870228967f56a052a41879eb18104f000","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"7","receipt":"3e2abe525c47eea48ea0d199b95ffc3be6293e47b216800e4ea8c1770c8d4ae02c164345b6d8f27c16eec2e6ef477e7ea54ec21fa1642ec52e62abf4b77b4009","timestamp":1565477812,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
