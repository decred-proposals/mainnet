At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  \n\nThat said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.\n\nLast, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.  This is something we can learn from and it is better that a situation like this happens sooner than later.

The acceptance of a **PAID Market Maker Service** is very concerning to me.  I believe that a yes vote will lead to an inquiry from regulators.  Any inquiry from the regulators will cost millions in legal fees, and will likely drain the treasury.  I am wondering how many programmers will be willing to work for free.  \n\nJZ - stated earlier that that the liquidity is for small traders. However, most traders are not going to move Decred more than 1%, so how does the community benefit small traders? Oh, bye the way, payment to a market maker to provide liquidity is the definition of market manipulation.  It does not matter if it is a stock, bond, or commodity.\n\nEvery day Decred naturally adds liquidity to the liquidity pool as blocks are created.  So over time there will be more size and more liquidity. \n Miners are natural sellers and they (provide offers or they hit the bid), since they need to pay for equipment and electricity.\n\nNew listing potential with Coinbase could be derailed if Decred pays for market making as a service.  Why you ask?  Coinbase will need to decide if Decred is a security or not. Paying for market makers as a service will likely put that decision into (no / limbo category).  Poloniex has already Geo-Fenced Decred in the US due to regulatory uncertainty.  The ethos of the entire community is being put to the test. \n\n**I vote NO** to any and all Paid Market Markers as a Service.","signature":"b9cf8480043b0bf8fc9f86a3a55631a3bbad57e03257e4b67f5030818fa369c596d4ca463a180cd6a37a2fe2a48664a71041a0176e7f981c61eb152dc728760a","publickey":"528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","commentid":"18","receipt":"7d06cbf3a51effa6e3fe6e37d82c8fc2f461d618bed4658a75b5a45bf9dbcfcccafc22a0b90e3d62d22d802efd9ef4773cd2e276e8919c6ddc47db1fe46cb70a","timestamp":1565496725,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And priced at $12k per month, which would cover 2x half-time personnel?\n\nThe capital for running the MM function isn't even being provided by the MM (it is being loaned by a miner and paid for by the Treasury), so the MM doesn't have a cost of tying up capital.  I don't see what other expense they are bearing other than time and materials?\n\nWhy can't MMs come to the table with the same 'fight club' mentality that characterizes the rest of the Decred contractor community and prove they can add value before asking for professional comp levels?\n\nPersonally, I think this current batch of proposals should all be voted down, and the MMs should sharpen their pencils and come back to the table with  proposals with a scope and timeline designed to actually serve as an \"experiment\" and with pricing that basically reflects an attitude of \"please give us a chance to cover our costs and prove ourselves.\"","signature":"1cedad9ef022bb37e3f972e31795851db6010a4a069010676bb51b343415d2b6444f63887d7d7fbfb7cfd4e617ee456600fc2e977072392334150e2c2e21f707","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"19","receipt":"0137837f4bb2abd4afea62a2ac323d1ff66d3f3db4cddef08a28ae708a429f9eaef02701e509fd3fb8e905a44913aed0f97b9510c9ae6ea853015739a3704d0a","timestamp":1565497205,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I mean, if we've solved the order book liquidity problem, and there truly is pent up interest to buy and sell, then avg. daily trading volume should clearly rise.  \n\nIf avg. daily trading volume doesn't rise w/ the buy and sell walls showing up, then we can conclude that the real problem is a lack of interest to participate in the market, and not the lack of order book liquidity.\n\nIf there is no interest to participate in the market, they paying a MM to setup buy and sell walls to increase order book liquidity is a wasted expense.\n\n+++\n\nMy hypothesis as to Decred's lack of liquify and volume is as follows:\n   - the core community is very strong, like a cult, and they are all staking, but it is a cult that is operationally incompetent, and can't figure out how to market itself\n   - since the general market hasn't really heard about the project the participation rate from typical run of the mill traders and speculators is abysmal \n   - Decrd's market awareness scores 1 out of 10 versus Bitcion's 10 out of 10;  see:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US\u0026q=decred,litecoin,bitcoin%20cash\n\nAnyways, running a MM experiment should help us to understand better which of the two problems we have (a) lack of order book liquidity, or (b) general lack of awareness about the project.  If we run the MM experiment and average daily trading volume rises, we can conclude we have problem (a) and the MM proposal fixes it.

Decred either **IS** or **ISN'T** a security. A paid market maker service will not make it tip one way or the other.\n\nIf you believe Decred is a security, no current exchange should have listed it or should trade it. The implications would be major and we should all rethink our participation in this project and the implications of doing so. \n\nIf Decred isn't a security the regulation you refer to doesn't apply at all and you are suggesting to vote no based on unrelated information.\n\nNobody is currently in position to say definitively if Decred is or isn't a security  because current regulation is incomplete and purposely vague regarding CC. What we can do however is use the SEC framework, past comments and existing laws regarding traditional security assets and  apply it to Decred to make an educated Guess.\n\nMy personal conclusion in this regard is that Decred is most probably not a security  (or at least, that hundreds of projects are quite a lot more at risk of being securities well before we even begin to consider Decred to be a security) I believe that major definitions of what are securities would need to be changed before that happens.  Thus personally, I will act and consider Decred not a security, unless an official regulatory statement is made and say it explicitly is.\n\nPoloniex geofencing Decred,  while adding,trading and promoting an ICO at the same time should be enough convince anyone that their action have nothing to do with fear of regulations. Just like you should not make your decision based on coinbase's decision to consider Decred for listing either.","signature":"51937fde84400fbff6f2a6466f18dd38e79bf131d7ad6aab014b5da9aad882f689361ab63e2e98a5fa20678c2f33e24ee2e90ada5094a9ec605e6a50909b050e","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"21","receipt":"67741275354aaf2dd6131c1039841b07f49d56ac067f26e93533fb231b9a0ce617ce3e6c3dfa030d7fca3e2ea1aefb266ad4b87c7da2094763cbccfe09b4890f","timestamp":1565532255,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We as a distributed mind of stakeholders must make an assessment to the best of our ability given the information which is available to us. Agree that the Polo action is near meaningless, Coinbase is far more appropriate as a reference point.\n\nAgree that if your base assumption is that it is non-compliant today, then the whole cc model falls apart. We are not seeing this play out in the market.\n\nWe must remember that we are pioneering a new was of organisation here. This is the first time this experiment has ever been run and there will always be risks associated with that. Use your best judgement given the circumstances.

We first need to find out and establish some relation between providing liquidity and increase in volume and if possible whether there is a demand for liquidity or not. Although i would rather have free market take its course but here are some things that we as a community should ask for if these proposals are to going to be voted on. These are all suggestions, not demands, please show your support or disapproval via comment votes and replies if you (dis)agree with a specific point.Feel free to extend this list in replies to this comment:\n\n- **Cost** - It must be similar to other heads of expenditures, which from cursory research seem to be around $20-30k/month or lower.\n- **Transparency** - One of the contributors (jz being a good candidate) should have at least view only access to trading operations of MM. Also whatever proof that would be provided if a regulator or court asked to prove no unethical practices are happening should be available to the community as well, in form of monthly reports(?).\n- **Opt-out clause** - It should be possible to terminate the contract if desired results are not visible in 3 months with review happening every 3 months.\n- **DEX** - Option to add DEX pairs when it launches.\n\nMy main motivation to consider a MM at this moment in time is to get research data and finding out with some degree of certainty that introducing liquidity on order books leads to better market interest. Other than that my suggestions are an attempt to reduce strain on treasury and achieve transparency/accountability and reduce need for trust.","signature":"6947bd514c921d70d094886d9075f008d91c6a1d8ae8cf7d5ed33e1078f1f4da0dad3dcc0172682374a600975ffa311cf89bcc33bbabcfd59aa6567a2a25810d","publickey":"98cf480835aabf91c43c2913db1849d0c80b947f1fe1392804150a633582a84f","commentid":"24","receipt":"b559b818a8ca979b704737679b3b9541f5fe715a077f133f57ab5b2a5b1beb6d42160bb640cd29ba7bb0747e21c90482defc730dd66c5fd452932745557c2007","timestamp":1565541837,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
