At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  \n\nThat said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.\n\nLast, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.  This is something we can learn from and it is better that a situation like this happens sooner than later.

The acceptance of a **PAID Market Maker Service** is very concerning to me.  I believe that a yes vote will lead to an inquiry from regulators.  Any inquiry from the regulators will cost millions in legal fees, and will likely drain the treasury.  I am wondering how many programmers will be willing to work for free.  \n\nJZ - stated earlier that that the liquidity is for small traders. However, most traders are not going to move Decred more than 1%, so how does the community benefit small traders? Oh, bye the way, payment to a market maker to provide liquidity is the definition of market manipulation.  It does not matter if it is a stock, bond, or commodity.\n\nEvery day Decred naturally adds liquidity to the liquidity pool as blocks are created.  So over time there will be more size and more liquidity. \n Miners are natural sellers and they (provide offers or they hit the bid), since they need to pay for equipment and electricity.\n\nNew listing potential with Coinbase could be derailed if Decred pays for market making as a service.  Why you ask?  Coinbase will need to decide if Decred is a security or not. Paying for market makers as a service will likely put that decision into (no / limbo category).  Poloniex has already Geo-Fenced Decred in the US due to regulatory uncertainty.  The ethos of the entire community is being put to the test. \n\n**I vote NO** to any and all Paid Market Markers as a Service.","signature":"b9cf8480043b0bf8fc9f86a3a55631a3bbad57e03257e4b67f5030818fa369c596d4ca463a180cd6a37a2fe2a48664a71041a0176e7f981c61eb152dc728760a","publickey":"528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","commentid":"18","receipt":"7d06cbf3a51effa6e3fe6e37d82c8fc2f461d618bed4658a75b5a45bf9dbcfcccafc22a0b90e3d62d22d802efd9ef4773cd2e276e8919c6ddc47db1fe46cb70a","timestamp":1565496725,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And priced at $12k per month, which would cover 2x half-time personnel?\n\nThe capital for running the MM function isn't even being provided by the MM (it is being loaned by a miner and paid for by the Treasury), so the MM doesn't have a cost of tying up capital.  I don't see what other expense they are bearing other than time and materials?\n\nWhy can't MMs come to the table with the same 'fight club' mentality that characterizes the rest of the Decred contractor community and prove they can add value before asking for professional comp levels?\n\nPersonally, I think this current batch of proposals should all be voted down, and the MMs should sharpen their pencils and come back to the table with  proposals with a scope and timeline designed to actually serve as an \"experiment\" and with pricing that basically reflects an attitude of \"please give us a chance to cover our costs and prove ourselves.\"","signature":"1cedad9ef022bb37e3f972e31795851db6010a4a069010676bb51b343415d2b6444f63887d7d7fbfb7cfd4e617ee456600fc2e977072392334150e2c2e21f707","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"19","receipt":"0137837f4bb2abd4afea62a2ac323d1ff66d3f3db4cddef08a28ae708a429f9eaef02701e509fd3fb8e905a44913aed0f97b9510c9ae6ea853015739a3704d0a","timestamp":1565497205,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I mean, if we've solved the order book liquidity problem, and there truly is pent up interest to buy and sell, then avg. daily trading volume should clearly rise.  \n\nIf avg. daily trading volume doesn't rise w/ the buy and sell walls showing up, then we can conclude that the real problem is a lack of interest to participate in the market, and not the lack of order book liquidity.\n\nIf there is no interest to participate in the market, they paying a MM to setup buy and sell walls to increase order book liquidity is a wasted expense.\n\n+++\n\nMy hypothesis as to Decred's lack of liquify and volume is as follows:\n   - the core community is very strong, like a cult, and they are all staking, but it is a cult that is operationally incompetent, and can't figure out how to market itself\n   - since the general market hasn't really heard about the project the participation rate from typical run of the mill traders and speculators is abysmal \n   - Decrd's market awareness scores 1 out of 10 versus Bitcion's 10 out of 10;  see:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US\u0026q=decred,litecoin,bitcoin%20cash\n\nAnyways, running a MM experiment should help us to understand better which of the two problems we have (a) lack of order book liquidity, or (b) general lack of awareness about the project.  If we run the MM experiment and average daily trading volume rises, we can conclude we have problem (a) and the MM proposal fixes it.

Decred either **IS** or **ISN'T** a security. A paid market maker service will not make it tip one way or the other.\n\nIf you believe Decred is a security, no current exchange should have listed it or should trade it. The implications would be major and we should all rethink our participation in this project and the implications of doing so. \n\nIf Decred isn't a security the regulation you refer to doesn't apply at all and you are suggesting to vote no based on unrelated information.\n\nNobody is currently in position to say definitively if Decred is or isn't a security  because current regulation is incomplete and purposely vague regarding CC. What we can do however is use the SEC framework, past comments and existing laws regarding traditional security assets and  apply it to Decred to make an educated Guess.\n\nMy personal conclusion in this regard is that Decred is most probably not a security  (or at least, that hundreds of projects are quite a lot more at risk of being securities well before we even begin to consider Decred to be a security) I believe that major definitions of what are securities would need to be changed before that happens.  Thus personally, I will act and consider Decred not a security, unless an official regulatory statement is made and say it explicitly is.\n\nPoloniex geofencing Decred,  while adding,trading and promoting an ICO at the same time should be enough convince anyone that their action have nothing to do with fear of regulations. Just like you should not make your decision based on coinbase's decision to consider Decred for listing either.","signature":"51937fde84400fbff6f2a6466f18dd38e79bf131d7ad6aab014b5da9aad882f689361ab63e2e98a5fa20678c2f33e24ee2e90ada5094a9ec605e6a50909b050e","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"21","receipt":"67741275354aaf2dd6131c1039841b07f49d56ac067f26e93533fb231b9a0ce617ce3e6c3dfa030d7fca3e2ea1aefb266ad4b87c7da2094763cbccfe09b4890f","timestamp":1565532255,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We as a distributed mind of stakeholders must make an assessment to the best of our ability given the information which is available to us.

We are not seeing this play out in the market.\n\nWe must remember that we are pioneering a new was of organisation here.

We first need to find out and establish some relation between providing liquidity and increase in volume and if possible whether there is a demand for liquidity or not. Although i would rather have free market take its course but here are some things that we as a community should ask for if these proposals are to going to be voted on. These are all suggestions, not demands, please show your support or disapproval via comment votes and replies if you (dis)agree with a specific point.Feel free to extend this list in replies to this comment:\n\n- **Cost** - It must be similar to other heads of expenditures, which from cursory research seem to be around $20-30k/month or lower.\n- **Transparency** - One of the contributors (jz being a good candidate) should have at least view only access to trading operations of MM. Also whatever proof that would be provided if a regulator or court asked to prove no unethical practices are happening should be available to the community as well, in form of monthly reports(?).\n- **Opt-out clause** - It should be possible to terminate the contract if desired results are not visible in 3 months with review happening every 3 months.\n- **DEX** - Option to add DEX pairs when it launches.\n\nMy main motivation to consider a MM at this moment in time is to get research data and finding out with some degree of certainty that introducing liquidity on order books leads to better market interest. Other than that my suggestions are an attempt to reduce strain on treasury and achieve transparency/accountability and reduce need for trust.","signature":"6947bd514c921d70d094886d9075f008d91c6a1d8ae8cf7d5ed33e1078f1f4da0dad3dcc0172682374a600975ffa311cf89bcc33bbabcfd59aa6567a2a25810d","publickey":"98cf480835aabf91c43c2913db1849d0c80b947f1fe1392804150a633582a84f","commentid":"24","receipt":"b559b818a8ca979b704737679b3b9541f5fe715a077f133f57ab5b2a5b1beb6d42160bb640cd29ba7bb0747e21c90482defc730dd66c5fd452932745557c2007","timestamp":1565541837,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Decred needs some sort of an engine to kick-start trading of an asset that has a massive hodling properties. Great problem to have tbh) But I understand the market and its a very mean place! In reality when an asset has a great value roughly 10%(possibly even less) of all circulation that is on the exchanges defines the price. So when a majority 90% is hodling for the long term the minority which are day traders and speculators define/discover the price short/middle term. Exposing themselves to a much greater risks when in short term or swing positions. Im 100% in favor of MM coming to generate day trading.\n\n-Im on a fence from ethical POV. Lack of clarity on mechanics of how MMs work with order book and inventory stops me from making a confident and well informed choice. I understand algos can not be disclosed. But a bit more detailed understanding beyond over-generalized idea of how MMs provide liquidity would be very helpful. Hopefully MMs can clarify that part.","signature":"7da383ebbcf87faa2a7a40fdaa2560315e8c0ffbb856d960638ea1830809eedc3fa872a3d65ce48c7d97546dab6d54a1caf605552e5802da6c5ac326d73e4b01","publickey":"f72039032f4b6e6ff2bbb9655c1859c195d143af330af2910c43f237d494ec8d","commentid":"25","receipt":"7f943fb4be568296f193af5abe2a48df7cdabeeb4fab06675babe8e42162bd75a29f2b3108f7d1c0d7c0f9dc371fc194995da9ee046e484e5c9e181feed32405","timestamp":1565583152,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I tend to go off of the decentralization requirement those was used with Eth, it is decentralized enough to not be a security. I have very little to no concern Decred will ever be labeled a security. \n\n2- DCR has no liquidity. None. I can’t even sell 10 DCR at times without moving the stinking market a little. In order to attract more attention to Decred then we must have liquidity. Will you provide it by placing your DCR, BTC, USD up on the order books? I will not.\n\n3- Concerns of wash trading and manipulation. I think it is possible to detect if these activities are taking place. I would like to see a clause added that would end the contract if detected.\n\nMy bottom line is that market makers are needed for Decred to advance where we all know it should be. I will be voting accordingly and giving my support for the MM proposal to IterativeCap. Vote for what you feel is in YOUR best interest.\n\nI am not happy i had to spend any Decred to make this comment. What can i say, I love my DCR. But there will come a time when everyone wants to exit or increase their position. As the market stands now, its not possible unless you OTC. For people like me, with not nearly enough Decred to use OTC trading, a MM would be a tremendous help. \n\nLike it or not these are my thoughts.

The discourse so far has been extremely healthy and both sides bring valid points to the table. My comments will hopefully illuminate why we thought it was prudent to work with an MM as well as clarify some of the misconceptions that are being brought up.\n\nThe need for an MM quickly arose as I began speaking with a number of institutional investors here in Silicon Valley. While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment. Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure. Similarly, investors have to weigh current liquidity in their research as a measure of sentiment and demand. \n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean that MMs are being brought in to help the wealthy, it is merely institutions who have been most vocal about the problem. The lack of liquidity affects investors big and small, and it seems like contracts are the most affected as they actually have to liquidate DCR to pay their bills. Not having liquidity + constant sell pressure from contractors and miners forces the price down and does not instill confidence within the broader market. \n\nAnother driving factor in our pursuit was the fact that an asset positioned to capture the SoV market needs liquidity. If an asset isn’t investable, I.e. liquid enough for investors to move in/out of, it can’t compete with other SoV contenders in the market. If you look back at Chris Burniske’s work on the institutional investors case for BTC, he notes that inevitability is one of the hall marks of any asset, and as such, we must prioritize DCR’s liquidity if we expect it to be an SoV. This issue is particularly exacerbated by the fact the DCR has such a high stake rate. \n\nIn terms of cost, something that should be stressed is that everything is malleable. Costs aren’t fixed, and we prompted the MMs to create proposals that were flexible so that stakeholders could decide the appropriate number of crosses, market depth, uptime, etc. $30,000 within 2% on each side seemed enough to facilitate retail investors moving in/out of positions with ease, but my understanding is that the MMs are willing to make this number $50k or even $15k, it all really depends on what we think is best. \n\nLastly, and we’ve stated this before, but all of the firms chosen to submit proposals are high quality firms with a lot of reputational skin in the game. For context, Altonomy just raised a large financing round from Polychain Capital, Grapefruit Trading was started by the former founder of Cumberland, and i2 has been a crypto OTC desk for a long time and active DCR stakeholder. We only engaged firms who’s values line up with those shared by DCR stakeholders.","signature":"5ad5f79ad19aaaf06f72b8725c9822c3ef3d2a5151f1fb046ac6ac6f33869b52f37b77b3d03052b75beb633c62c7522f37579642c4f88079c1029c706fdbd00a","publickey":"107a5db445996608df8bd7cecfb6b3e41d74fd6c659916becb4e54167849a96e","commentid":"29","receipt":"6bc98d749769293faedb6c805eb521cf8a1816e1309e35271c025b523621d0e28b6a82bddc736a311b38361df14d3abf2d1ff0de26b712398db2807b2a841609","timestamp":1565646704,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In BTC or XMR, for example, the only cost's associated with keeping funds locked up in orders is the potential for losing funds due to exchange issues, but in DCR, you also give up potential earnings on PoS rewards.\n\nThe other main portion of your sovereignty lost when locking up DCR in orders on-exchange is the ability to vote and have a say in the future of Decred as a whole.\n\nBecause of these two reasons, owners of DCR are incentivized _not_ to provide any liquidity, as it ultimately costs them much more than on standard PoW chains. As such, I believe paying a MM a small portion of the treasury income is a great middle ground, and an excellent way to keep all of the benefits of staking DCR, while also being able to increase liquidity of DCR across the board.\n\nThe key here to me is that we, as stakeholders of Decred, can guide the MM process all the way through, and ultimately shut it down if it fails and or turns out to be unnecessary.\n\nTl;dr -- Because of PoS drastically reducing liquidity and increasing costs associated with keeping DCR locked up in orders on-exchange, a paid MM is a great thing to explore.","signature":"a85e41b64cc05b75ceeafe89c194ce1bb0fb764118deefbb367579dbae22b1fbdae04b160faca8b2b876a10c6ac301922eb19bcf206eff10ae75d3c1e523480f","publickey":"18f6cb98e06dfd5153ccafc105e7b6ab812bcd1ac71b62829060cf49670ea791","commentid":"34","receipt":"e5bf371b62ba8b7ced02085bdd57f5c1d19c49b082290482484afc9aba655c13c87b1fd56128d2c48ae180639186efdbdefcbdd4eb9ba3ecd9f2ebe3b368c90b","timestamp":1565701918,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I plan to write a more in-depth post about the benefits of liquidity to the value of an asset (particularly as it relates to cryptocurrencies). \n\nUntil that time here is some related reading: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/country/illiquidity.pdf \n\nI generally believe that creating liquidity at various pricing levels will attract traders to the asset -\u003e who create additional organic liquidity (and volume). With the increased liquidity and volumes, the asset will become available to a new class of investors, particularly institutional investors with strict liquidity requirements in their holdings. Where today, even if these investors had an interest in Decred, would be barred or limited in the size of holding due to the lack of liquidity available today.\n\nAll in, I think it's crucial to drive liquidity to the asset and it's a matter of the community determining the best manner in which to do so.","signature":"9f03455b22ed3cd2078e686e5431ff8b05e779d7505a162242466ce6e1ece6a3e530bf79df175a92224f634932734e1ef1b0145bc0b3b8d5d06a03e4b426b505","publickey":"e11726f552ac8d51728f3f945d2221f81add1a445cfcd0bdd211ad7b3d04c933","commentid":"36","receipt":"6c86dbd793373f588e350489164935565c323d5eea4b666b829ae81a279f263ec678981ecdfba9dc0806f736c46d2abe58b38ed1d04ad97f1ae994c78e93e608","timestamp":1565718003,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

More you explain it, more it looks like treasury paying to hasten the entry or exit of II.\n\nThis is probably a temporary problem as incentives shift with lower inflation and hobbyist stakers go back to trading. also if and when this prolonged bear market goes away and regulatory uncertainty reduces, more people would be willing to trade.\n\nStill i just want to do this experiment in case it does kick start this process early and my suggestion is for as much transparency as possible and range of $20-30k/month.

If all top coins in cryptospace hiring them doesnt mean its the right way to go. Communities of those coins never being asked what ppl think about hiring them. Decred does it the first time and other projects will use it as a reference in the future. Pretty cool!) \nIMO cryptocurrencies should not hire DMMs. Market makers must remain neutral from what they market make and ONLY crypto exchanges should bring them on the market or they market make themselves for profit. Traditional exchanges do allow companies to pay MMs for market making as well. A company is not a currency tho but I think its nonsense as well. I dont think a cryptocurrency paying for market making from a treasury publicly or by any other crypto foundation behind closed doors is a right way.
