Decred Journal 2021

## Summary

This proposal funds the production of Decred Journal and Politeia Digest for 12 months of 2021, using between $34,000 and $39,000 in total.

## What

[**Decred Journal**](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) (DJ) is a detailed monthly report of all notable project activity in key areas such as:

- Development - progress in ~18 code repositories simplified to less technical language
- People - new contributors, community's social media stats, unusual changes of activity
- Governance - Treasury in/outflows, recap of proposal activity
- Network - health indicators for mining, staking, nodes, research highlights
- Integrations - updates from existing and new services in the ecosystem
- Outreach efforts
- Events - summaries of attended and organized events
- Media - notable articles/videos/podcasts/translations
- Markets recap
- Relevant External - crypto news in areas relevant for Decred like decentralization, governance and funding, chain forks, DEX, privacy, etc, with a focus on events we can learn from

The primary goal is to deliver all notable project activity in one big monthly report, in order to help stakeholders track project progress and make better decisions. Secondary goals are to promote the project by exposing a solid amount of work each month and attract new contributors. For more on motivation and target audience please see our production [guidelines](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md#goals).

[**Politeia Digest**](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/) (PD) serves to keep voters updated on all notable Politeia activity. This includes summaries and highlights of proposals and their edits, comments, and related activity. It tracks Politeia in greater detail compared to Decred Journal, but is still short enough to catch up quickly. There is no fixed schedule, but releases are timed to drop when most useful, e.g. before voting is started for a batch of proposals.

Politeia Digest is included in this proposal because it has the same goals as DJ in one specific area (Politeia), and is done by same people with similar production process.

The level of detail of these two publications is most useful to sophisticated stakeholders and investors. For ~30 minutes a month one can stay on top of most things and follow the links to learn more about specific stories. But the general audience can still pick interesting parts and skip the rest. Also, DJ and PD can serve as a source of news for other formats of updates.

## Past work recap

33 issues of Decred Journal have been released since April 2018 and 40 issues of Politeia Digest since October 2018. In 2019 they were funded by [2019 Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a766) proposal with approx. $30,900. In 2020 they were funded by [2020 Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5) proposal and have spent approx. $28,300. These estimates do not include translations.

Over time the production was optimized as we got better at it and removed less valuable content.

To improve resilience and reach content is published on [Medium](https://medium.com/decred/journals/home), [GitHub](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/), [Publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/decredjournal), [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/signals/decred-journal-december-2020-decred/) and [Block Commons](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/). All sources are stored in [Git](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md#why-git) repositories that anyone can clone to protect it from loss and censorship. As a bonus it allows offline reading and easier translations. The production process is extensively [documented](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md) to facilitate knowledge transfer to new maintainers if necessary.

A total of 126 DJ issue [translations](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) to 8 languages were made. PD received 10 translations to 2 languages.

Several data tracking projects were started while collecting data for DJ: [social media stats](https://github.com/decredcommunity/social-media-stats), [events index](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events), [network stats](https://github.com/decredcommunity/network-stats), [proposal docs](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) and [translations index](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations). These were mostly unfunded but are now mature enough to be included in the [Open Source Research 2021](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/020b8b0) proposal that is now open for discussion.

## Who

The work will be done by @bee, @degeri, @richardred, and @saender, with occasional contributions from others.

## Budget

We will set the monthly spend limit to $2,700 for Decred Journal and $550 for Politeia Digest. In practice, I expect the values to be around $2,350 and $490. This translates to a total $34,000 expected and **$39,000 limit** for 12 months.

An average 2020 issue had ~5,000 words (~12 pages) and links to ~240 sources. To get a sense what it takes to produce you can check the latest [November](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202011.html) and [December](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202012.html) issues. Basically it involves collecting and writing up _a lot_ of mini stories. Perhaps the biggest part is harvesting ~18 code repositories for notable updates and translating that to less technical language (while still keeping some details since we also target developers).

This budget includes design expenses to produce images, effectively "stealing" them from the [design proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1dc1571) (it had $3.5K reserved for 6 months of DJ and PD). It is easier to think about a complete "product" with all parts included, both for voters and the product owner. Knowing the full product cost also improves accountability.

The monthly limit also includes a buffer of up to $500 discretionary spending to cover things like spikes of activity to process, additional automation, recruiting a new contributor, or experiments.

This proposal does not include translations, which are covered by @kozel's separate [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a).

This proposal will fund the work done between January 1 and December 31, 2021. Any unused funds will stay in the Treasury.
