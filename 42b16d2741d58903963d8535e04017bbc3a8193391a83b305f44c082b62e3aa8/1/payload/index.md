Amin Rafiee: Decred Hackers Congress

**What:**
The Hackers Congress, hosted by Paralelni Polis in Prague, remains as one of the most important locations and events in the crypto space. It is the only place in the world operating purely on cryptocurrencies in its 6 years of operation. It has hosted figures such as Andreas Antonopoulos, Amir Taaki, Peter Tod, and many more great talents and faces. The audience includes some of the most educated, dedicated, and supportive individuals who are there to learn about how the world is shifting. 

I am a supporter and advocate of Decred. I have been selected to speak at the Hackers congress for the 5th year. I have the necessary experience, knowledge, and integrity to deliver a powerful presentation.

**Why:** I have been a public speaker since 2014. I have not been at a event which can match the speaker list and audience of the Hackers Congress. I believe having Decred present will make a solid stance in what Decred has to offer. Samourai wallet, Monero, Aragon, Zcash and many other leaders in their space have visited and presented their projects at this event. 

**How:**
I will promote Decred by several means:

* Decred will be included in my talk and presentation from the perspective of decentralized governance, funding, and exchange. 
* Discuss Decred during other talks (interviews/discussions).
* Marketing and merchandise promotions.
* Promote the event with a focus on decred via twitter and photos.
* Produce an article in relation to the event, including what Decred brings to the table.
* Speak to individuals who are interested in using or developing with Decred and bring them to the community.

**When:**
The event is taking place between the 4th of October 2019 to the 6th of October 2019. My talk is on the 5th.
