I personally don't think the Treasury should pay $2,050 towards this though, because for me the cost is too high and it could appear as paying people to insert Decred into their more general talks.\n\nIn my view it's fine for the Treasury to fund people going to events to present and represent Decred, but I'm more comfortable when they are people who know some aspect of the project very well talking about that. Being funded to give presentations about Decred should be a small aspect of a larger role within the project, in my view.","signature":"bf8c91cd75a16f269deb06a37b502ae045c727497e456ab8a5eb6093017f10abcf36857da26f53a5d370a4c26db758065e93ca2bf6fefe6c7951c6f19d1e6801","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"7a0ec37887934a5d024c8e10f42162ce507833655535759b2e87f6f49126997ebc03d799f65fa7bc0b3b6b87e156d4ec385f45ccea3b3b4dbbbd7c4b69e85409","timestamp":1570579630,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Amin's speaking skills are good, topics covered are very important and aligned with what Decred aims to build. Decred part starts at [4 h 26 m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYkIyUaRG0s\u0026t=4h26m06s) and ends at 4 h 30 m, so about 4.5 min in total. The coverage was good and presented Decred to a very relevant audience (I'm a fan of the idea to present Decred at [hacker](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/83)/decentralization/sovereignty-oriented conferences and OPT-OUT looks like a good fit). The whole talk ends at 4 h 51 m, giving Decred about 10% of the total talk time.\n\nWithout knowing what % of the non-talk activity was dedicated to Decred, I'm not sure it is fair to position the cost as covering 50% of expenses. On the other hand, $2K doesn't look like a crazy amount for a speaker like Amin.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- Were you networking for yourself or for Decred? If the latter, how Decred community will gain access to connections made during your networking time? Just thinking how Decred can capture the results like this since this activity is included in the cost.\n- Was there a stand or booth with Decred branding?\n- In general what rough % of your trip was dedicated to representing Decred?\n\nRegardless of how this proposal goes, I hope you captured the evidence (video/photo) and I'm looking forward for a write-up about your trip in the context of representing Decred. This can be later used to negotiate a reimbursement. Disclaimer: I'm not managing Treasury payouts or the Events 2019 budget, just observed that it is a common practice to request a reimbursement once the work is proven to be useful.","signature":"c666bf147649d381114bb285e21e490a87e33217272f3fd8e07eacee2ebfe06e5296a5891c131b9ae1390577210c82b0cac3d394038b423f090d0e53f89b0e02","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"4","receipt":"82cceb476e830a9dd196489634712bc3408c9ab18439abb75b1976aa910d3c5319c65dae1b40fc9894d6513118c1214d882de604fc278a65d3ba31e9ca737c0c","timestamp":1570906240,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This case demonstrates a possible gap in our org structure. If person managing certain proposal's budget does not trust a new person and is unwilling to experiment, the new person cannot access that budget. His choices then are to seek other budgets and negotiate with their owners to \"host\" his expenses, or make a proposal and create a new individual budget for himself. There are pros in cons in both options. First one means we need multiple, ideally cooperating, events budgets. If one rejects to host you, you go to another. This is not necessarily bad but it is more complex and we simply don't have that right now. Second means that all small compensations that are declined need to go Politeia. This is also not necessarily bad - it is good (in fact, amazing) that we have _some_ way to definitely resolve this, it introduces new people to the stakeholders and implicitly raises the issue I just described. The downside is friction and the risk of flooding Pi.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not criticizing proposal owners who reject to cover requests like this (Dustorf in this case). Their reputation depends on how well they manage funds trusted to them. If I were in such a position, perhaps I would often lean towards the safe side and not host expenses of new people until I'm really, really sure they do the job. My point here was to outline the challenge of funding small and new initiatives in our current system.\n\nPerhaps we just need a few more umbrella marketing/events proposals with different strategies.","signature":"018c8e9324fbe42eccb16c2a318608bd8c4bc63896f5fd5e152416a434382c3c557156a1e2089b45bd7fe8011ed2a4532b17e0357022e8666ea62c95aee5f209","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"6","receipt":"2dabbee0056ed2a70d46e6c49352960f0ebc183e4c4f2b0b51c5bf439827b0949ab6dbc63747768851255977bd489f147b13cb17b09792d7d08c9e20ef96390e","timestamp":1570906964,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
