I personally don't think the Treasury should pay $2,050 towards this though, because for me the cost is too high and it could appear as paying people to insert Decred into their more general talks.\n\nIn my view it's fine for the Treasury to fund people going to events to present and represent Decred, but I'm more comfortable when they are people who know some aspect of the project very well talking about that. Being funded to give presentations about Decred should be a small aspect of a larger role within the project, in my view.","signature":"bf8c91cd75a16f269deb06a37b502ae045c727497e456ab8a5eb6093017f10abcf36857da26f53a5d370a4c26db758065e93ca2bf6fefe6c7951c6f19d1e6801","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"7a0ec37887934a5d024c8e10f42162ce507833655535759b2e87f6f49126997ebc03d799f65fa7bc0b3b6b87e156d4ec385f45ccea3b3b4dbbbd7c4b69e85409","timestamp":1570579630,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Amin's speaking skills are good, topics covered are very important and aligned with what Decred aims to build. Decred part starts at [4 h 26 m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYkIyUaRG0s\u0026t=4h26m06s) and ends at 4 h 30 m, so about 4.5 min in total. The coverage was good and presented Decred to a very relevant audience (I'm a fan of the idea to present Decred at [hacker](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/83)/decentralization/sovereignty-oriented conferences and OPT-OUT looks like a good fit). The whole talk ends at 4 h 51 m, giving Decred about 10% of the total talk time.\n\nWithout knowing what % of the non-talk activity was dedicated to Decred, I'm not sure it is fair to position the cost as covering 50% of expenses. On the other hand, $2K doesn't look like a crazy amount for a speaker like Amin.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- Were you networking for yourself or for Decred? If the latter, how Decred community will gain access to connections made during your networking time? Just thinking how Decred can capture the results like this since this activity is included in the cost.\n- Was there a stand or booth with Decred branding?\n- In general what rough % of your trip was dedicated to representing Decred?\n\nRegardless of how this proposal goes, I hope you captured the evidence (video/photo) and I'm looking forward for a write-up about your trip in the context of representing Decred. This can be later used to negotiate a reimbursement. Disclaimer: I'm not managing Treasury payouts or the Events 2019 budget, just observed that it is a common practice to request a reimbursement once the work is proven to be useful.","signature":"c666bf147649d381114bb285e21e490a87e33217272f3fd8e07eacee2ebfe06e5296a5891c131b9ae1390577210c82b0cac3d394038b423f090d0e53f89b0e02","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"4","receipt":"82cceb476e830a9dd196489634712bc3408c9ab18439abb75b1976aa910d3c5319c65dae1b40fc9894d6513118c1214d882de604fc278a65d3ba31e9ca737c0c","timestamp":1570906240,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This case demonstrates a possible gap in our org structure. If person managing certain proposal's budget does not trust a new person and is unwilling to experiment, the new person cannot access that budget. His choices then are to seek other budgets and negotiate with their owners to \"host\" his expenses, or make a proposal and create a new individual budget for himself. There are pros in cons in both options. First one means we need multiple, ideally cooperating, events budgets. If one rejects to host you, you go to another. This is not necessarily bad but it is more complex and we simply don't have that right now. Second means that all small compensations that are declined need to go Politeia. This is also not necessarily bad - it is good (in fact, amazing) that we have _some_ way to definitely resolve this, it introduces new people to the stakeholders and implicitly raises the issue I just described. The downside is friction and the risk of flooding Pi.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not criticizing proposal owners who reject to cover requests like this (Dustorf in this case). Their reputation depends on how well they manage funds trusted to them. If I were in such a position, perhaps I would often lean towards the safe side and not host expenses of new people until I'm really, really sure they do the job. My point here was to outline the challenge of funding small and new initiatives in our current system.\n\nPerhaps we just need a few more umbrella marketing/events proposals with different strategies.","signature":"018c8e9324fbe42eccb16c2a318608bd8c4bc63896f5fd5e152416a434382c3c557156a1e2089b45bd7fe8011ed2a4532b17e0357022e8666ea62c95aee5f209","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"6","receipt":"2dabbee0056ed2a70d46e6c49352960f0ebc183e4c4f2b0b51c5bf439827b0949ab6dbc63747768851255977bd489f147b13cb17b09792d7d08c9e20ef96390e","timestamp":1570906964,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This has been a pretty interesting experience. Moving forward, I would like to update the proposal and make some comments regarding doubts and concerns. The first thing I would like to address here is that many comments were made regarding the duration of the talk. It seems that people did not understand the entire scope of my proposal, that the presentation in itself was a part of a multi-staged process, which now based on the new material should be evident.\n\nSome members were questioning my involvement. It seems there was a lack of clarity on that aspect.  I think its best to clarify with past contributions.\n\n**Past involvements: **\nI started Bittopia back in 2017. I have a meetup group which now contains over 200 members. This was very active when I was living in the Netherlands. You can see the below events which I hosted in collaboration with Haon, who has been one of the most supportive members and the key person to introduce me to Decred. I must give many thanks to his support and contributions.   \nMeetup, December 12, 2017 (Utrecht, Netherlands): https://www.meetup.com/BitTopia-Blockchain-Made-Easy/events/245693754/\nMeetup, Feb 13, 2018 (Utrecht, Netherlands): https://www.meetup.com/BitTopia-Blockchain-Made-Easy/events/246681062/\n\n**My promises as per proposal:**\n- Decred will be included in my talk and presentation from the perspective of decentralized governance, funding, and exchange. \nhttps://youtu.be/fmgNbLGCO5U?t=1433\n- Discuss Decred during other talks (interviews/discussions).\nhttps://youtu.be/dq2SGpI5-Gw?t=1357\n- Produce an article in relation to the event, including what Decred brings to the table.\nhttps://medium.com/@evok3d/decred-report-hackers-congress-paralelni-polis-hcpp19-bd8e634f93de\n- Marketing and merchandise promotions.\nSee photos within the article. \n- Promote the event with a focus on decred via twitter and photos.\nhttps://twitter.com/OfficialCryptos/status/1189539702031949825\nhttps://twitter.com/ev0k3d/status/1180535299513950208\n- Speak to individuals who are interested in using or developing with Decred and bring them to the community.\nSee article. \n\nI have also prepared a report which will be sent to Haon to distribute to key members. This explains my analysis of the proposal system as well as other elements which I believe should be reviewed from a usability and integrity perspective. \n\nMoving forward, I have decided to pull the proposal and request donations instead. I hope this work goes to show my integrity and desire to collaborate with the Decred community. If you believe my work had value and you would like to reward me for it, please send DCR to the following address:\nDCR: DsWdLmF6wjiAS4yJVqPM8nWso6vG7hPbbUS\n\nIf there are aspects of my work that you did not enjoy or felt as though it was not in line with Decred's standards, then please reach out to me and help me improve.

It's dangerous to pay anything at all for just talking nice about Decred.  Motives will always be in question if the precedent is set that random people can get paid for mentioning Decred in a positive light.\n\nNow, people do get paid for speaking on behalf of Decred at conferences and other events.  What makes them different?  In almost all instances, they are either (1) known contributors in other areas like development, design, etc. (2) explicitly hired to perform PR functions (i.e. DittoPA) as part of a broader awareness and education campaign, or (2) established community members who are notably NOT known/important/repsected/blah/blah/blah people in crypto.\n\nThought experiment: Say Pomp (Anthony Pompliano) proposed to get paid 500 USD every time he said \"I like Decred\".    How about 50 USD?  The value in that would be ZERO (0) if he were getting paid **at all** for it, but immeasurable if he did it for other reasons (you know, he like the project and were perhaps a stakeholder).\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n","signature":"91abe289a6fdf7d87a9dee0f8013ce48a6acadc5c87b847376a972a2e2dd285a46586992d74647850aca4be31e5782608419268e806cedf2bcd967e430d67f00","publickey":"22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","commentid":"12","receipt":"e67f9ef52b8a41167a98f1e0ded15db855ad6eaf75b89a7d515d98069dc7a41774503ef53a8a29e252b81e5ca1db641e14440214d85a8bf2a3c42c3fc0b1aa03","timestamp":1572643972,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
