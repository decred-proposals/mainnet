I like the idea however I have some comments/questions:\n\n1. I would like to know who we expect to be the artists that will be producing the works and who we expect the buyers to be in this instance? \n\n2.  Socialist Decred would fund the arts and go broke in the process. Capitalist Decred (my position) expects any venture it funds to produce greater value for the treasury than it outputs. My question is, why should Capitalist Decred fund more than one or two artworks at most? Why can't the income from the first two artworks sold, which could be bootstrapped by the the Treasury, not be deployed to paying for the remaining artwork? If my calculations are correct, spending $900 on production with expected return of $3000 should mean the whyDecred community fund can finance all future artwork off 1or 2 and remain in profit after a piece is sold. Thus I would not support any more than one or two at most being funded by Capitalist Decred with my preference for one followed by entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n3. Can you please describe your strategy for getting eyes on whyDecred? Producing the art and the site is excellent, but we need it to make an impact and the only way we achieve that is by getting eyes on the website. What is the marketing strategy?\n\nThanks, CM.","signature":"8cfe57f33ad1c760d4e7ec4f7fa21e2639696e0518faccb77a8d0181639807770b2773f83b675af992b93714db9e8e5a9567c6004c9100ef172fca08ce970b0a","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"f7129659dc9d6147c4ece1eb03756ecb0bacbfb252e31be44545cd7c21fdf66a1a956dc0b1568adf8422ae3bb8ae20b17cd010f7616cf74da435c74a68ea5605","timestamp":1605010967,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You are one of the most active member of our community in social networks, even podcasts! So I was expecting your comment here ;)\n\n**1.1** The artists are chosen from all around the world, we will later create a page with their names, photos and portfolio URL's.\n\n**1.2** The buyers will be art collectors and Decred fans who wish to decorate their home/office with awesome, unique art. Art that many people will buy, but few will have the status and honor of owning the original piece. People routinely spend k's of dollars on art. The [most expensive art pieces in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-paintings-ever-sold-including-157-million-nude-modigliani-2018-5?r=MX\u0026IR=T) sell for hundreds of millions of dollars. [Closer to our range, you see them sell for 3k, 5k, 10k, 15k](https://shop.eden-gallery.com/en/art/collections/artworks). **As you can see in these links there is a market for these things.** [The art market is worth 64 billion per year](https://www.google.com/search?q=art+market+worth). The top art in the world are investments that appreciate over time. They are collectors items. \n\n**2.1** Can the Treasury go broke if this proposal is 0.15% of the Treasury at current prices? I feel very confident we will make the Decred price go up by **much more** than this amount. Visualize the site is complete, all arts and writing is done. Can you see the power it will have to change people's minds? It is very capitalist in terms of the return on investment. Plus, we are the first Decred marketing initiative to bring funds back from marketing efforts. How can this financially be a losing proposition?\n\n**2.2** Great question! Currently one art is digital (the bailouts one) and one is a physical watercolor (the treasury one). Not all pieces will be physical, so this funding method you mention is limited. Why? Digital art enables us to edit and perfect the piece in a way that physical makes it impossible. So digital can be higher quality through continuous refinement and editing. Making less of the arts avaiable as physical originals will also help them get sold, as there are less available.\n\n**2.3** Expensive art pieces take months to sell. Let's say it takes each original 3-6 months to sell, and we have 16. Marketing can start after all 16 pieces are complete. Do you want to start marketing of this initiative in \u003e48 months, in \u003e4 years? Or do you want to start marketing of this initiative in less than 5 months if this proposal passes? I'm sure we can agree sooner is better :)\n\n**2.4** You are clearly an intelligent person who is strong with numbers. But the world is not all numbers, some people run on emotions and the more artistic side of life. Should we not make an effort to reach those people too? I see us as a team, our numbers people speak to other numbers oriented people, let our art people speak to artistically sensitive people, who are a new audience for us. Let us reach new audiences! I think this site will be very powerful in attracting new people to Decred. People who think and feel differently than a programmer. That is why Steve Jobs was so successful. He did not work as a programmer, we worked as a marketer and an artist. He said, [\"real artists ship\"](https://www.creativethinkinghub.com/steve-jobs-was-right-real-artists-ship/). He [signed the first Macs like pieces of art with his team](https://www.cultofmac.com/122408/signed-by-steve-jobs-co-signatures-inside-the-original-macintosh-case/). He saw technology as art, and millions resonated with this view.\n\n**3.1** I wrote a bit about this in \"The WhyDecred.com Strategy in a Nutshell\", here is a recap, **plus a few new points**:\n\n* You will bring eyes. All our community will bring eyes, by mentioning, posting and tweeting links to our site, using it as support and a place to welcome and convert new users.\n* Rank via SEO. I can do this, look at my Flippa profile. When people search things related to money and fiat, we will appear in the search results. This constantly brings eyes, every month.\n* Make such a high quality expos√© of the true nature of fiat currencies, that we will attract links from all parts of the internet. Links also get eyes. Like Mises.org, people will link to us from all over.\n* After the site is translated the eyes brought from search and from links will multiply.\n* Via ads, including display, Twitter, Facebook, search and more. Even Reddit ads. This will be part of the monthly marketing budget, $2,400 in this case for the first test month.\n* Make ads cheaper and higher converting with captivating art. This can make them 10x cheaper and more effective. This brings a multiple of more eyes.\n* Hiring full time Twitter tweeters who will tweet and engage NEW PEOPLE 8 hours, 22 days a month. We will hire 2 full time people in the first month of our marketing test, included in this proposal. They will always tweet at someone new. This will brings new eyes.\n* We will use our completed site as leverage to get into podcasts, interviews, etc. This will bring ears and eyes and new people. Podcasts need new guests constantly. We plan to target podcasts of all kinds unrelated to crypto, and some even unrelated to finance. Think outside the crypto/Decred box to get eyes outside the crypto/Decred box.\n* We can target influencers and convert them into Decred. We will mount Twitter ads on top of tweets targeted at influencers, to gather a large amount of likes and retweets, and get their attention on our tweet and on our site. Once an inlcuencer is converted, he/she will help convert their entire audience. This brings new eyes.\n* Our site will be ideally made to convert a large portion of the population, combining data and art in a way that is appealing to both hemispheres of the brain, not just one hemisphere. This makes the site convert more of the eyes that land on it.\n* Once the site is complete, and after we provide measurable success, we can spend a fixed marketing sum per month to continually grow our community and pool of investors. This will monthly and continually bring new eyes.\n* All of these points have ripple effects. A friend will invite their friend, and will use our site will fully convert them. \n* Our site will be like ammunition we can all use when we engage new people.\n\n**With your support, this site can become a great converter of public opinion. The site will be similar to [Luthers 95 Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses) in which he caused a tidal wave of change of opinion in the masses. This is what I envision for this site and the marketing efforts we place on top of it. I hope you support us in making this a reality! ** \n\nI did my best to share my view with you checkmate :) let me know if you have further questions.","signature":"404a9fe087b6f6cc7a6180733ad8659171cb6ff25ce7388affea6239f300e450baf3d638acf7bcf36b54afc07e2b6d8ed0b8a670089e9ff0b1796ab4e16f3c0a","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece30e1517931b73e1b33be18280ae5233a7165fe6dde547fe0cde11914a502cd937000c04bd9474d66bb5b79faae98f894ca843396af6d079bb4df5771830a","timestamp":1605036735,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
