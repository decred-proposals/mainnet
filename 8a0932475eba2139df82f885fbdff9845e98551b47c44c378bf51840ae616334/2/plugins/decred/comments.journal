I like the idea however I have some comments/questions:\n\n1. I would like to know who we expect to be the artists that will be producing the works and who we expect the buyers to be in this instance? \n\n2.  Socialist Decred would fund the arts and go broke in the process. Capitalist Decred (my position) expects any venture it funds to produce greater value for the treasury than it outputs. My question is, why should Capitalist Decred fund more than one or two artworks at most? Why can't the income from the first two artworks sold, which could be bootstrapped by the the Treasury, not be deployed to paying for the remaining artwork? If my calculations are correct, spending $900 on production with expected return of $3000 should mean the whyDecred community fund can finance all future artwork off 1or 2 and remain in profit after a piece is sold. Thus I would not support any more than one or two at most being funded by Capitalist Decred with my preference for one followed by entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n3. Can you please describe your strategy for getting eyes on whyDecred? Producing the art and the site is excellent, but we need it to make an impact and the only way we achieve that is by getting eyes on the website. What is the marketing strategy?\n\nThanks, CM.","signature":"8cfe57f33ad1c760d4e7ec4f7fa21e2639696e0518faccb77a8d0181639807770b2773f83b675af992b93714db9e8e5a9567c6004c9100ef172fca08ce970b0a","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"f7129659dc9d6147c4ece1eb03756ecb0bacbfb252e31be44545cd7c21fdf66a1a956dc0b1568adf8422ae3bb8ae20b17cd010f7616cf74da435c74a68ea5605","timestamp":1605010967,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You are one of the most active member of our community in social networks, even podcasts! So I was expecting your comment here ;)\n\n**1.1** The artists are chosen from all around the world, we will later create a page with their names, photos and portfolio URL's.\n\n**1.2** The buyers will be art collectors and Decred fans who wish to decorate their home/office with awesome, unique art. Art that many people will buy, but few will have the status and honor of owning the original piece. People routinely spend k's of dollars on art. The [most expensive art pieces in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-paintings-ever-sold-including-157-million-nude-modigliani-2018-5?r=MX\u0026IR=T) sell for hundreds of millions of dollars. [Closer to our range, you see them sell for 3k, 5k, 10k, 15k](https://shop.eden-gallery.com/en/art/collections/artworks). **As you can see in these links there is a market for these things.** [The art market is worth 64 billion per year](https://www.google.com/search?q=art+market+worth). The top art in the world are investments that appreciate over time. They are collectors items. \n\n**2.1** Can the Treasury go broke if this proposal is 0.15% of the Treasury at current prices? I feel very confident we will make the Decred price go up by **much more** than this amount. Visualize the site is complete, all arts and writing is done. Can you see the power it will have to change people's minds? It is very capitalist in terms of the return on investment. Plus, we are the first Decred marketing initiative to bring funds back from marketing efforts. How can this financially be a losing proposition?\n\n**2.2** Great question! Currently one art is digital (the bailouts one) and one is a physical watercolor (the treasury one). Not all pieces will be physical, so this funding method you mention is limited. Why? Digital art enables us to edit and perfect the piece in a way that physical makes it impossible. So digital can be higher quality through continuous refinement and editing. Making less of the arts avaiable as physical originals will also help them get sold, as there are less available.\n\n**2.3** Expensive art pieces take months to sell. Let's say it takes each original 3-6 months to sell, and we have 16. Marketing can start after all 16 pieces are complete. Do you want to start marketing of this initiative in \u003e48 months, in \u003e4 years? Or do you want to start marketing of this initiative in less than 5 months if this proposal passes? I'm sure we can agree sooner is better :)\n\n**2.4** You are clearly an intelligent person who is strong with numbers. But the world is not all numbers, some people run on emotions and the more artistic side of life. Should we not make an effort to reach those people too? I see us as a team, our numbers people speak to other numbers oriented people, let our art people speak to artistically sensitive people, who are a new audience for us. Let us reach new audiences! I think this site will be very powerful in attracting new people to Decred. People who think and feel differently than a programmer. That is why Steve Jobs was so successful. He did not work as a programmer, we worked as a marketer and an artist. He said, [\"real artists ship\"](https://www.creativethinkinghub.com/steve-jobs-was-right-real-artists-ship/). He [signed the first Macs like pieces of art with his team](https://www.cultofmac.com/122408/signed-by-steve-jobs-co-signatures-inside-the-original-macintosh-case/). He saw technology as art, and millions resonated with this view.\n\n**3.1** I wrote a bit about this in \"The WhyDecred.com Strategy in a Nutshell\", here is a recap, **plus a few new points**:\n\n* You will bring eyes. All our community will bring eyes, by mentioning, posting and tweeting links to our site, using it as support and a place to welcome and convert new users.\n* Rank via SEO. I can do this, look at my Flippa profile. When people search things related to money and fiat, we will appear in the search results. This constantly brings eyes, every month.\n* Make such a high quality expos√© of the true nature of fiat currencies, that we will attract links from all parts of the internet. Links also get eyes. Like Mises.org, people will link to us from all over.\n* After the site is translated the eyes brought from search and from links will multiply.\n* Via ads, including display, Twitter, Facebook, search and more. Even Reddit ads. This will be part of the monthly marketing budget, $2,400 in this case for the first test month.\n* Make ads cheaper and higher converting with captivating art. This can make them 10x cheaper and more effective. This brings a multiple of more eyes.\n* Hiring full time Twitter tweeters who will tweet and engage NEW PEOPLE 8 hours, 22 days a month. We will hire 2 full time people in the first month of our marketing test, included in this proposal. They will always tweet at someone new. This will brings new eyes.\n* We will use our completed site as leverage to get into podcasts, interviews, etc. This will bring ears and eyes and new people. Podcasts need new guests constantly. We plan to target podcasts of all kinds unrelated to crypto, and some even unrelated to finance. Think outside the crypto/Decred box to get eyes outside the crypto/Decred box.\n* We can target influencers and convert them into Decred. We will mount Twitter ads on top of tweets targeted at influencers, to gather a large amount of likes and retweets, and get their attention on our tweet and on our site. Once an inlcuencer is converted, he/she will help convert their entire audience. This brings new eyes.\n* Our site will be ideally made to convert a large portion of the population, combining data and art in a way that is appealing to both hemispheres of the brain, not just one hemisphere. This makes the site convert more of the eyes that land on it.\n* Once the site is complete, and after we provide measurable success, we can spend a fixed marketing sum per month to continually grow our community and pool of investors. This will monthly and continually bring new eyes.\n* All of these points have ripple effects. A friend will invite their friend, and will use our site will fully convert them. \n* Our site will be like ammunition we can all use when we engage new people.\n\n**With your support, this site can become a great converter of public opinion. The site will be similar to [Luthers 95 Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses) in which he caused a tidal wave of change of opinion in the masses. This is what I envision for this site and the marketing efforts we place on top of it. I hope you support us in making this a reality! ** \n\nI did my best to share my view with you checkmate :) let me know if you have further questions.","signature":"404a9fe087b6f6cc7a6180733ad8659171cb6ff25ce7388affea6239f300e450baf3d638acf7bcf36b54afc07e2b6d8ed0b8a670089e9ff0b1796ab4e16f3c0a","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece30e1517931b73e1b33be18280ae5233a7165fe6dde547fe0cde11914a502cd937000c04bd9474d66bb5b79faae98f894ca843396af6d079bb4df5771830a","timestamp":1605036735,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm very open to discussing what is best, and I will take an official stance in a few days after all of us interested share our ideas here. Here are my initial thoughts:\n\n* What would you recommend?\n* What do the others reading this recommend?\n* Commercial rights will probably need to be exclusive to WhyDecred.com, otherwise they might be sold on other sites in a way that diminishes our return on investment, since product profits will be shared to grow the project/Decred.\n* But maybe we could allow the art to be sold everywhere, but with the condition that the price is not below our own, similar to how Amazon handles this. This commercial openness might bring even more awareness to Decred. We can require all stores to link back to us in order to use our art commercially. These links can in turn help us with SEO and help us rank better, increase our domain authority, and get more traffic from related google searches, especially searches related to fiat money.\n* Everyone should be able to use the art anywhere, on any site, with the condition they do not remove the WhyDecred.com watermark. They might not need to link to us to use the arts in a non-commercial way, but it is appreciated. This is because tweets for example are too small to require a link. But maybe they can use a thread and link this way? Maybe we should also require links for non-commercial purposes?\n* We can use reverse image search and track where our images are used in the internet, then request links back to us, in a master-level SEO strategy. We can be kind about this request and not force it, just kindly request as per our license. If someone ignores our request I would recommend not taking any further action.\n* The Decred blockchain needs to be open source in order to be trusted and to allow collaboration. Our art store will use APIs to Printful and Printify and be heavily automated. I'm not sure there is much benefit of open sourcing it, maybe all we will accomplish is have competitor blockchains copycat our strategy and undermine our marketing efforts. Maybe code can be openly shared with trusted people like Jake Yocom-Piatt and others deep in our team, but in a way that it is not used by our competitors. I would like to share the code with our community but I don't want our strategy and site cloned, so that we maintain this site as a unique competitive edge of Decred.\n\nI'd love to see everyone's comments on this. Great questions bee. I would like to have consensus on this and I would also like us to increase our competitive advantage as much as possible.","signature":"d316ff37cbb5b8b88a9aae3e34153ddb7126f7fa6ee0f0ce16538cf7496e4e4c5f2e04dca44bc1c12e6c7f4bcc8c3beb5e787a3ef576cf7b515009af4bee520e","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"4","receipt":"de0d0effe440166322c1d3649ea941f54092fcb4978f66c496e44b250c930b54e4de612beba947bf3a10e16c59524d2f91c0bb0f367e4b082034e081dc780a04","timestamp":1605202970,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I echo that I love the doer mentality/initiative and think this is another great grassroots idea and proposal. Additionally, I think whyDecred.com looks great so far. \n\nThoughts/Comments:\n\n1. I think I would feel a lot more comfortable with the Treasury funding a tester month or two of marketing + a few pieces of art (2-4 rather than 16 pieces @ $900 a piece). My thought is that we can gauge art interest/quality with the few pieces and then revisit adding more pieces per results and success. \n\n2. To a point you made within the proposal: good art takes time (you mention 16 pieces will take months) - I would rather you get the funding to begin this project as soon as possible (with quality art in mind) given we have a lot of great technical releases in process that could work alongside whyDecred.com in getting the word out/building community.\n\n3. Speaking from a withDecred perspective, I think there is absolute collaboration that can be done synergistically with whyDecred. I really like the differentiated marketing approach (art+education+community+tangibles/merchandise) that whyDecred is proposing and think this has potential. \n\n-Cap","signature":"87e0eec9d36376fdd36fb5edd0d8c377a7e3c8113564d7eb341ed4f3d83cbd9dc523b59036ba2e4cfc6700b90a0b3c3a27e161d6a58892c0550a37d37272330e","publickey":"7fcfcb798a74f8c6e3334452b5e150559a5571d020ff38e970fb3c08d027a271","commentid":"5","receipt":"fa2d779c7c07834f53e1642061504834b092abe82ceb03fb12806ab181083ea15d76e786964cd211bd7db993ef4a823abce9a7db7a1355b4991ec9cdbc269d0b","timestamp":1605205539,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm glad you like it and I am honored by your kind words.\n\n1. If more people echo this sentiment of budgeting fewer pieces to start, I can amend my proposal to start with fewer pieces. So far you and checkmate have expressed interest in funding fewer pieces to start. What do the others think about this?\n\n2. That is why we will hire many different artists, to go as fast as we can! [As I mentioned in my Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/), the Treasury artwork for example started August 4th and the final piece was completed October 1st. So sometimes these detailed works take some time to paint. Artists don't like to be rushed, and if they can enjoy and savor the process they can make better art. It is like making love, spending quality time and going the distance makes everything better!\n\n3. I absolutely agree! I'm excited to share marketing data with you guys, share specific conversion rates, and explore all the ways we can collaborate together in the future as we go along. We can link back to you for some of your longer form content. I'm sure many ideas will continue to come to us.","signature":"c23644f069b1453f4a0768edba75008f28a88b6db669be08fe69c7b483391fd0c98de820d2dbe5b0bf4826581d7672cd8b8f6bc78c72dfd1074843f4f5ae0e0e","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"6","receipt":"08b3b18201d04e7c15b8ef05432288c4b14c627a785184031246bffe118e0609478a643ef1ba9950638c8c78d6a5a322ab9cdab6acb5a5bb1f2d4f5dd24ce70c","timestamp":1605206805,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So there is 6.4k saved. And we let all the artists know that 1 grand prize winner will be picked out of the 16 and they will receive 6-7k (or some other number). Make some kind of contest out of it to garner some extra attention. How will the winner be chosen? I am not sure. Could politeia be used? And as the voting ensues it would allow the artists to sweat the outcome and get more familiar with politeia. Not sure if you could do it based on likes/retweets or twitter voting since it can be gamed. \n\nOr just one big contest, perhaps on an art forum without hiring artists. Each piece of artwork that gets used on the website gets 200$. And perhaps we could do a politeia vote where we each pick 1 out of the 16 and the top three vote getters get 5k/3k/2k.\n16*200=3200\n5k+3k+2k=10k\ntotal cost =13.2k instead of 14.4k\n\nSome of this seems kind of involved but just throwing around some ideas.\n\nI am also fine with the way you have it laid out and this looks like a solid proposal to me.","signature":"47866a27886f77eb3dfc082ad0402b961b35f4b9524758224e51690b402c82d9ff46cae7444812eb4b1bcda92fa5113efc0f9ed671ed8eb98aa40f7c25122206","publickey":"91c82be3a06c4037ee123a1c28b99f1f00aeb8d4715e402f2b4c9ca1406b4f3e","commentid":"7","receipt":"09ab87ecd07e6dbf896c43a03e4ed1b7c08194c685f991c15774764cc66666a2e1de3dd5f6f5092d64cfe65dfa60a6fbf8e55de938bdb63f09e283dcb9a25607","timestamp":1605207544,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Making a contest sounds interesting. Conversations like this enrich the project so I thank you. Here are my thoughts:\n\n* Maybe we can make contests and give away art reprints to the community, in exchange for some sort of engagement or work or activity! \n* If we make a contest and lower our payout to the artists, we would fail to attract many of the top artists. A few hundred dollars dramatically changes the quality of the art. The best artists are in demand and they might not participate for lower pay. \n* Better art will probably also sell more. I see it like Apple products, the artistic investment will be returned. I want you to be very proud about the art piece you hang on your wall!\n* There is something special about making something the best you can, it is more inspiring. Trusting and going at it with everything you've got... this will help us inspire and convert more Decredizens. I would personally lose a bit of motivations thinking we are not making the best art we can. If I feel proud it helps me work at my best. I can't imagine myself being this passionate about XRP, for example.\n* Artists could fail us, disappear or turn something awful. In these instances I would have to repay myself and start again with another artist. I would absorb this risk myself. I don't think this will happen but it could.\n* There are many costs I am not billing directly, see \"Free Items for the Community\".\n* I secretly plan to make more than the 16 art pieces with this funding, but don't tell anyone yet ;) I plan to add a surprise Meme section and have some top arts there too. The meme section would simply pump Decred in a more emotional way, not as squarely logical as the other pieces. I suspect these might be the best sellers of our art store.\n* If we pay and attract top talent, and build a high traffic, famous site, we can later leverage this and our artistic reputation and have artists maybe work for less, in exchange of the status and exposure we can provide them. Maybe we can even attract art in the spirit of making the world better, for free. But for now I think we should pay and build ourselves first.\n* Thanks again for the contest idea, I will keep it in mind :)","signature":"2e7a18f77f6dbd2065822fb83e7df7013f7202668cb683c8b8b9efed61cd1ed21ae7fc8f77a2932e49e6ca7835460adb3a1aed5ffd362ba99080915a654ca10e","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"8","receipt":"09817a4ffcd289c6dddac2e543d79c511373a6e89b18c9d73dc986725890f973c5700ae18288d95674a1a98c18ac4058fa95101041b8d0e942ad11b5b73b390c","timestamp":1605210605,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
