WhyDecred.com - A Marketing Initiative

### What are we building?

We're building a website called [WhyDecred.com](https://www.whydecred.com/why-decred) where we will funnel people and convert them into Decred participants. 

The site has some innovations that make it unique. Read on to see why we think we will make an important difference for Decred, the industry and via ripple effects the future of money and governance on earth.

### Look at our [live demo](https://www.whydecred.com/why-decred)

The [website is already in progress](https://www.whydecred.com/why-decred)  and you can take a look at it! It will give you a good idea of what we are doing. We have completed 2 art pieces so far.

### Do we need new marketing initiatives?

Our price and ranking is down on the year into November. In comparison Bitcoin's price is up by more than double. The large amount of dying alt-coins creates a dangerous vacuum that pushes us down. Decred is perhaps the best cryptocurrency in the world, but the market does not recognize this. How can Bitcoin have a market cap >1,000x times greater than ours? We are severely undervalued. I worry we could continue spiraling down in an increasingly dominant narrative of Bitcoin maximalism. We should do a bit more to counter this maximalist narrative and establish Decred as a credible contender to Bitcoin.

### Will technology alone bring us success?

**Not necessarily.** Look at Linux, or the many amazing technologies that have failed to perform well in the consumer space. Let's not assume that technology alone will make Decred win. Returning to the Linux example, it is superior to Windows in almost every way but it is severely lacking in market penetration in the consumer space. Let us not allow Decred to be the obscure cryptocurrency that only geeks and geniuses value and use. Let us not underestimate the power and importance of:

### Network effects

They can make or break a company, a project or an entire industry. Sometimes being the best is not enough. Sometimes traction is important so you can stay in the game, the network effects game.

## The WhyDecred.com Strategy in a Nutshell

* List all the 24+ ways fiat money is damaging the world, so you get pumped to take action.
* Channel this anger, this passion, this pumped energy into understanding the best crypto solution: Decred.
* List all the 24+ reasons Decred is great, including basic shared with Bitcoin and distinctive reasons unique to Decred. List why Decred is superior to Bitcoin.
* Speak in a way that newcomers to crypto can understand, listing things we take for granted as "experts". Speak and captivate people the way we were captivated when we first understood things.
* Pair each point of both lists with an eye-catching, high quality art piece to make the message more powerful.
* Write in a way that is short, concise, to the point.
* Each art piece will be created by a different artist, to maximize creative diversity and reach the followers of the artists on their social media accounts, thus having them introduce Decred to their followers included in the price.
* Create a Decred art store where we sell the art of each point, so that people can advertise on their person their newly found passion of honest money and honest governance.
* Extend our marketing beyond the internet, attaching art to clothes, phone cases, laptop sleeves, stickers, mugs, paper notebooks, posters, museum level reprints, etc.
* Reinvest profits from product sales into a WhyDecred.com fund, and let the community choose how we spend it.
* Make our sales transparent, with public item and timestamp reporting, so that anyone can audit us by making a purchase.
* Help build Decred as a cultural and social movement.
* Translate the site into all relevant languages.
* Target our marketing at people of the world with moral values. Convert them into Decred participants who are not in it primarily for the money, but to make the world a better place, via honest money and honest governance. These people are the strong hands that will hold Decred long into the future, and help stabilize an ever increasing Decred price and Decred narrative.
* Hire people full time to engage new people on Twitter and other social media, and use WhyDecred.com as a welcome site to convert new users. Track conversions and measure effectiveness.
* Use art pieces in Tweets to attract people into the site. Post an art piece of how fiat money is damaging peoples lives, and invite them to learn more.
* Target high follower count individuals who might appreciate Decred and our stand on honest money, and help convert them into Decred supporters.
* Target podcasts that are not cryptocurrency related, and get exposure. Use the completed site and our follower count as validation to get access to these podcasts. Showcase our team of 16+ artists, 12+ translators, and marketers, as validation of the size of our team. Build a halo effect, demonstrate value and access these podcasts.
* Share access to these podcasts with other Decred community members, working as a team.
* Funnel people to our website via ads. Experiment with ads on AdSense, search, display networks, Facebook, Twitter, etc and measure the effectiveness of each to drive conversions.
* Experiment and learn in what countries we can be most effective, and focus our marketing there.
* Use our high quality art to attract people into clicking our ads.
* Over time iterate and perfect our message, writing, marketing, ads, art; iterate everything; becoming increasingly effective at converting users into Decred participants.
* **Measure site traffic, social engagements, followers and product sales to objectively measure our effectiveness.**
* And more. Honestly I could go on.

### Minor Points

* We are communicating abstract concepts, the art will help materialize these complex, abstract topics into something more tangible that even children will understand.
* Provide all art assets in a URL so anyone can download and use them in posts, tweets, videos, etc. Crop smaller parts of art pieces to make them useful too.
* The site will help us all clarify and solidify these abstract concepts, so we can all debate better. It will be like a resource to remember all of our strengths and all the weaknesses/problems of fiat currency.
* All art is long term. The topics we cover around fiat money will be relevant today and 1,000 years from now.
* Our art collection and writing can become a popular resource to learn about corrupt money.

## List 1: A Corrupt Money System

* Welcome to the Rabbit hole
* Never ending price increases
* Corrupt bailouts and handouts
* Invasion of privacy on digital transactions
* More murder and destruction via war deficit spending
* Stealing from the future
* Interest on the Debt per Citizen:  $1,067 usd per year
* Interest on the Debt per Family:  $3,350 usd per year
* Negative interest rates
* Destructive Asset Bubbles and Bursts
* Something for Nothing Culture
* Pension Fund Gambling and Theft
* 2%-3% Commission on All Card Payments
* Bank Runs
* Distorted Price Signals
* All Fiat Currencies go to Zero
* **And 12+ more in our draft we are still polishing. We will omit some of lower value/impact in a curation process.**

## List 2: Why Decred

* The Decred Treasury
* Limited Supply
* Decentralized
* Revolutionary Governance: Politeia
* Open Source
* Cannot be Confiscated
* Decred DEX
* High Ethics and Moral Code
* No ICO
* Privacy
* **And 20+ more reasons in our draft we are still polishing. We will omit some of lower value/impact in a curation process.** I'm sure you can think of a few not listed.

### Why the art is important

* It communicates higher value.
* It helps anchor abstract concepts into a more tangible reality.
* It can be placed on products than can be sold.
* Products like clothes are extended marketing into the physical world.
* The art products will be Decred conversation starters.
* The art products will be fiat money, counterfeit money conversation starters.
* They attract attention, making ads more effective and lower cost (because of the higher conversion rate).
* They also increase post engagement on social media.
* They help decrease the site bounce rate and measurably increase engagement.
* They initiate a curiosity to see all the art pieces, and therefore read all the points.
* The originals have only 1 of each in supply  (when not made digitally) and can become collector items, helping build Decred's halo effect as they rise in value in the market.
* Etc.

### Can't we make cheaper art?

We thought about this option. It has a few problems.

* It is lower value.
* It would not merit an art store.
* It would not take our marketing into products and the physical world.
* Ads, posts, everything would be less effective, less inspiring and would ultimately convert less.
* Etc, many of the other positives I already mentioned would be negated.

We also made a [Twitter poll about this](https://twitter.com/ParisSmithson/status/1323071532692897792). The high quality art option won by 63% to 37%, meaning 70% more people said HIGH quality is better instead of LOW, price included. 37% + 70% = 63%.

If you voted **cheap art**, I encourage you to support this initiative with the high quality art option in the spirit of community and cohesion following a democratic process.

### What audiences do we want to target experimental ads on?

* People that already use cryptocurrencies.
* People that understand sound money and the inherently corrupt nature of fiat currencies, but don't have any cryptocurrency yet.
* People with moral values who would support honest money and honest governance.
* People in countries with high inflation rates and high levels of corruption who are seeking a solution.
* Countries where ad costs are low and conversion levels are high.
* More to be discovered.

## Budget

We request to produce **16 high quality art pieces, at $900 usd each.**

We also request **$2,400 usd for 1 month of experimental marketing efforts** that have measurable parameters of success, to be executed after the 16 art pieces are complete. 

### Budget Details

Initially we wanted to build everything first and then bill it later, so the community could see in advance exactly what we are doing. That is why we already completed 2 art pieces, ["The Decred Treasury"](https://www.whydecred.com/art/decred-treasury.jpg) and ["Corrupt Bailouts and Handouts"](https://www.whydecred.com/art/corrupt-bailouts-and-handouts.jpg).

But the community strongly suggested on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777/status/1322651861044940805) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/) that dozens of proposals is not good, and that it was better to bundle more into a larger proposal. We honor the will of the community so we accepted this and presented it in this way.

**Note: the original art pieces**, when not made digitally and made physically, **will be sold for $3k+ usd each**. Only 1 original will exist of each. 

**Note 2: the $900 covers** artist search from hundreds of candidates, artist interviews, artist selection, art brainstorming and meetings, art sketch production (about 10 per art piece), source material gathering and research, art materials cost, final art production cost, art revisions and corrections, original art piece UPS/DHL shipping, product configurations for each art piece in the art store for all products, and art direction. 

### Profit Sharing

When a normal product is sold in the store, we will split the profit 50% with the project treasury and 50% for us site creators/maintainers.

When an original art piece is sold, we agreed with the artists to give them a third of the sale, a third for us and a third for the project treasury.

### Free Items for the Community

If our proposal passes, we will include these items at our own expense:

* Research, writing, writing polish.
* **Website development costs.**
* **Art store development costs.**
* Auditable art store feature on the site.
* Recurring costs to run the art store.
* Perpetual hosting and domain renewal fees.
* Smaller items like the logo, product print testing, etc.

### Risk Free Payment Schedule

We will request payment of the art pieces after they are complete and delivered. We will not receive funds in advance for the art pieces.

After the art pieces, art store and site are complete, we will request our experimental marketing budget.

### Next Phases

After this is complete, and after we present our marketing results, and demonstrate that they are effective, we will continue with monthly marketing and completing more art pieces from list 1 and 2. We will also start translating the site to all important languages. As the price of Decred goes up and we demonstrate effectiveness, we can increase our budget and hire more people, if supported by results and data. 

### Collaboration with the Marketing Team

I am open to collaborating with the marketing team, sharing strategies and data. We have already decided to exchange links on some sites, and are discussing further possibilities.

### An Evergreen Asset

Whatever happens, WhyDecred.com will continue to sit there, being always relevant. It is an evergreen investment that will never decay, end or disappear. 

### A book?

We might even write a book from the content and art we create, sell the book, and create ads to the book in a way that we create a positive feedback loop that pays for itself and promotes Decred for free. We might be able to recover the cost of marketing ads the book with the book sale, in a way that we can sell thousands of books and reach many people at near zero additional cost.

### I have more ideas

I have 2 more interesting project ideas to help Decred, in a way that has not been done before, and will present them to all of you after we complete this one. One is a product and the other I won't give any hints yet.

### WhyDecred.com would cost 0.00175% of the Treasury.

To fund our initiative, we would use just 0.00175% of our treasury.

### Can we boost the price of Decred by more than 0.00175%?

Of course we can!! This investment is guaranteed to increase the Decred price and amount of users by more than 0.00175%. I honestly think much more. Give us a shot. We won't let you down.

### P.S.

* Look at my [Flippa profile](https://flippa.com/users/992972). I have over $100k USD in transactions and a 100% rating. I also have a super seller badge. No unhappy customers. 
* I am actually using my real name. I am attaching my reputation to the outcome of this initiative. I believe in it, I believe in Decred and I believe in the Decred community.
