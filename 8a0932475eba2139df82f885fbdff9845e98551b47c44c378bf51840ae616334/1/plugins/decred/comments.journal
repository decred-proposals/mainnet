I like the idea however I have some comments/questions:\n\n1. I would like to know who we expect to be the artists that will be producing the works and who we expect the buyers to be in this instance? \n\n2.  Socialist Decred would fund the arts and go broke in the process. Capitalist Decred (my position) expects any venture it funds to produce greater value for the treasury than it outputs. My question is, why should Capitalist Decred fund more than one or two artworks at most? Why can't the income from the first two artworks sold, which could be bootstrapped by the the Treasury, not be deployed to paying for the remaining artwork? If my calculations are correct, spending $900 on production with expected return of $3000 should mean the whyDecred community fund can finance all future artwork off 1or 2 and remain in profit after a piece is sold. Thus I would not support any more than one or two at most being funded by Capitalist Decred with my preference for one followed by entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n3. Can you please describe your strategy for getting eyes on whyDecred? Producing the art and the site is excellent, but we need it to make an impact and the only way we achieve that is by getting eyes on the website. What is the marketing strategy?\n\nThanks, CM.","signature":"8cfe57f33ad1c760d4e7ec4f7fa21e2639696e0518faccb77a8d0181639807770b2773f83b675af992b93714db9e8e5a9567c6004c9100ef172fca08ce970b0a","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"f7129659dc9d6147c4ece1eb03756ecb0bacbfb252e31be44545cd7c21fdf66a1a956dc0b1568adf8422ae3bb8ae20b17cd010f7616cf74da435c74a68ea5605","timestamp":1605010967,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
