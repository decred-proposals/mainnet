### UPDATE 5: Going MVP

I have decided to allow this proposal to expire and acquire the "abandoned" status. I am returning to the proposal's roots of doing the work first. The innovative nature of the proposal and the subjective nature of the art pieces raises many questions, as you can see in the comments. I think my time is better spent actually doing the work, that way the questions will become naturally resolved. Once you see what we did, you will know exactly what you are getting. No confusion, no BS. Only then will a completely informed decision be possible.

The MVP will complete a minimum amount of writing, along with their respective images. They won't be premium art pieces, they will be simple MVP images. The MVP site will be ready to receive visitors. We can add premium art, the art store, translations, the ebook, and the many marketing tactics available **in later proposals**.

Thank you all for your feedback and good luck.

**Note to Politeia Moderators:** please allow 7 days for final comments, then allow the proposal to become abandoned. Thank you.
