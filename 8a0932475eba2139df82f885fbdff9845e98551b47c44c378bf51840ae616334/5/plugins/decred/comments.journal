I like the idea however I have some comments/questions:\n\n1. I would like to know who we expect to be the artists that will be producing the works and who we expect the buyers to be in this instance? \n\n2.  Socialist Decred would fund the arts and go broke in the process. Capitalist Decred (my position) expects any venture it funds to produce greater value for the treasury than it outputs. My question is, why should Capitalist Decred fund more than one or two artworks at most? Why can't the income from the first two artworks sold, which could be bootstrapped by the the Treasury, not be deployed to paying for the remaining artwork? If my calculations are correct, spending $900 on production with expected return of $3000 should mean the whyDecred community fund can finance all future artwork off 1or 2 and remain in profit after a piece is sold. Thus I would not support any more than one or two at most being funded by Capitalist Decred with my preference for one followed by entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n3. Can you please describe your strategy for getting eyes on whyDecred? Producing the art and the site is excellent, but we need it to make an impact and the only way we achieve that is by getting eyes on the website. What is the marketing strategy?\n\nThanks, CM.","signature":"8cfe57f33ad1c760d4e7ec4f7fa21e2639696e0518faccb77a8d0181639807770b2773f83b675af992b93714db9e8e5a9567c6004c9100ef172fca08ce970b0a","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"f7129659dc9d6147c4ece1eb03756ecb0bacbfb252e31be44545cd7c21fdf66a1a956dc0b1568adf8422ae3bb8ae20b17cd010f7616cf74da435c74a68ea5605","timestamp":1605010967,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You are one of the most active member of our community in social networks, even podcasts! So I was expecting your comment here ;)\n\n**1.1** The artists are chosen from all around the world, we will later create a page with their names, photos and portfolio URL's.\n\n**1.2** The buyers will be art collectors and Decred fans who wish to decorate their home/office with awesome, unique art. Art that many people will buy, but few will have the status and honor of owning the original piece. People routinely spend k's of dollars on art. The [most expensive art pieces in the world](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-paintings-ever-sold-including-157-million-nude-modigliani-2018-5?r=MX\u0026IR=T) sell for hundreds of millions of dollars. [Closer to our range, you see them sell for 3k, 5k, 10k, 15k](https://shop.eden-gallery.com/en/art/collections/artworks). **As you can see in these links there is a market for these things.** [The art market is worth 64 billion per year](https://www.google.com/search?q=art+market+worth). The top art in the world are investments that appreciate over time. They are collectors items. \n\n**2.1** Can the Treasury go broke if this proposal is 0.15% of the Treasury at current prices? I feel very confident we will make the Decred price go up by **much more** than this amount. Visualize the site is complete, all arts and writing is done. Can you see the power it will have to change people's minds? It is very capitalist in terms of the return on investment. Plus, we are the first Decred marketing initiative to bring funds back from marketing efforts. How can this financially be a losing proposition?\n\n**2.2** Great question! Currently one art is digital (the bailouts one) and one is a physical watercolor (the treasury one). Not all pieces will be physical, so this funding method you mention is limited. Why? Digital art enables us to edit and perfect the piece in a way that physical makes it impossible. So digital can be higher quality through continuous refinement and editing. Making less of the arts avaiable as physical originals will also help them get sold, as there are less available.\n\n**2.3** Expensive art pieces take months to sell. Let's say it takes each original 3-6 months to sell, and we have 16. Marketing can start after all 16 pieces are complete. Do you want to start marketing of this initiative in \u003e48 months, in \u003e4 years? Or do you want to start marketing of this initiative in less than 5 months if this proposal passes? I'm sure we can agree sooner is better :)\n\n**2.4** You are clearly an intelligent person who is strong with numbers. But the world is not all numbers, some people run on emotions and the more artistic side of life. Should we not make an effort to reach those people too? I see us as a team, our numbers people speak to other numbers oriented people, let our art people speak to artistically sensitive people, who are a new audience for us. Let us reach new audiences! I think this site will be very powerful in attracting new people to Decred. People who think and feel differently than a programmer. That is why Steve Jobs was so successful. He did not work as a programmer, we worked as a marketer and an artist. He said, [\"real artists ship\"](https://www.creativethinkinghub.com/steve-jobs-was-right-real-artists-ship/). He [signed the first Macs like pieces of art with his team](https://www.cultofmac.com/122408/signed-by-steve-jobs-co-signatures-inside-the-original-macintosh-case/). He saw technology as art, and millions resonated with this view.\n\n**3.1** I wrote a bit about this in \"The WhyDecred.com Strategy in a Nutshell\", here is a recap, **plus a few new points**:\n\n* You will bring eyes. All our community will bring eyes, by mentioning, posting and tweeting links to our site, using it as support and a place to welcome and convert new users.\n* Rank via SEO. I can do this, look at my Flippa profile. When people search things related to money and fiat, we will appear in the search results. This constantly brings eyes, every month.\n* Make such a high quality expos√© of the true nature of fiat currencies, that we will attract links from all parts of the internet. Links also get eyes. Like Mises.org, people will link to us from all over.\n* After the site is translated the eyes brought from search and from links will multiply.\n* Via ads, including display, Twitter, Facebook, search and more. Even Reddit ads. This will be part of the monthly marketing budget, $2,400 in this case for the first test month.\n* Make ads cheaper and higher converting with captivating art. This can make them 10x cheaper and more effective. This brings a multiple of more eyes.\n* Hiring full time Twitter tweeters who will tweet and engage NEW PEOPLE 8 hours, 22 days a month. We will hire 2 full time people in the first month of our marketing test, included in this proposal. They will always tweet at someone new. This will brings new eyes.\n* We will use our completed site as leverage to get into podcasts, interviews, etc. This will bring ears and eyes and new people. Podcasts need new guests constantly. We plan to target podcasts of all kinds unrelated to crypto, and some even unrelated to finance. Think outside the crypto/Decred box to get eyes outside the crypto/Decred box.\n* We can target influencers and convert them into Decred. We will mount Twitter ads on top of tweets targeted at influencers, to gather a large amount of likes and retweets, and get their attention on our tweet and on our site. Once an inlcuencer is converted, he/she will help convert their entire audience. This brings new eyes.\n* Our site will be ideally made to convert a large portion of the population, combining data and art in a way that is appealing to both hemispheres of the brain, not just one hemisphere. This makes the site convert more of the eyes that land on it.\n* Once the site is complete, and after we provide measurable success, we can spend a fixed marketing sum per month to continually grow our community and pool of investors. This will monthly and continually bring new eyes.\n* All of these points have ripple effects. A friend will invite their friend, and will use our site will fully convert them. \n* Our site will be like ammunition we can all use when we engage new people.\n\n**With your support, this site can become a great converter of public opinion. The site will be similar to [Luthers 95 Theses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses) in which he caused a tidal wave of change of opinion in the masses. This is what I envision for this site and the marketing efforts we place on top of it. I hope you support us in making this a reality! ** \n\nI did my best to share my view with you checkmate :) let me know if you have further questions.","signature":"404a9fe087b6f6cc7a6180733ad8659171cb6ff25ce7388affea6239f300e450baf3d638acf7bcf36b54afc07e2b6d8ed0b8a670089e9ff0b1796ab4e16f3c0a","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece30e1517931b73e1b33be18280ae5233a7165fe6dde547fe0cde11914a502cd937000c04bd9474d66bb5b79faae98f894ca843396af6d079bb4df5771830a","timestamp":1605036735,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm very open to discussing what is best, and I will take an official stance in a few days after all of us interested share our ideas here. Here are my initial thoughts:\n\n* What would you recommend?\n* What do the others reading this recommend?\n* Commercial rights will probably need to be exclusive to WhyDecred.com, otherwise they might be sold on other sites in a way that diminishes our return on investment, since product profits will be shared to grow the project/Decred.\n* But maybe we could allow the art to be sold everywhere, but with the condition that the price is not below our own, similar to how Amazon handles this. This commercial openness might bring even more awareness to Decred. We can require all stores to link back to us in order to use our art commercially. These links can in turn help us with SEO and help us rank better, increase our domain authority, and get more traffic from related google searches, especially searches related to fiat money.\n* Everyone should be able to use the art anywhere, on any site, with the condition they do not remove the WhyDecred.com watermark. They might not need to link to us to use the arts in a non-commercial way, but it is appreciated. This is because tweets for example are too small to require a link. But maybe they can use a thread and link this way? Maybe we should also require links for non-commercial purposes?\n* We can use reverse image search and track where our images are used in the internet, then request links back to us, in a master-level SEO strategy. We can be kind about this request and not force it, just kindly request as per our license. If someone ignores our request I would recommend not taking any further action.\n* The Decred blockchain needs to be open source in order to be trusted and to allow collaboration. Our art store will use APIs to Printful and Printify and be heavily automated. I'm not sure there is much benefit of open sourcing it, maybe all we will accomplish is have competitor blockchains copycat our strategy and undermine our marketing efforts. Maybe code can be openly shared with trusted people like Jake Yocom-Piatt and others deep in our team, but in a way that it is not used by our competitors. I would like to share the code with our community but I don't want our strategy and site cloned, so that we maintain this site as a unique competitive edge of Decred.\n\nI'd love to see everyone's comments on this. Great questions bee. I would like to have consensus on this and I would also like us to increase our competitive advantage as much as possible.","signature":"d316ff37cbb5b8b88a9aae3e34153ddb7126f7fa6ee0f0ce16538cf7496e4e4c5f2e04dca44bc1c12e6c7f4bcc8c3beb5e787a3ef576cf7b515009af4bee520e","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"4","receipt":"de0d0effe440166322c1d3649ea941f54092fcb4978f66c496e44b250c930b54e4de612beba947bf3a10e16c59524d2f91c0bb0f367e4b082034e081dc780a04","timestamp":1605202970,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I echo that I love the doer mentality/initiative and think this is another great grassroots idea and proposal. Additionally, I think whyDecred.com looks great so far. \n\nThoughts/Comments:\n\n1. I think I would feel a lot more comfortable with the Treasury funding a tester month or two of marketing + a few pieces of art (2-4 rather than 16 pieces @ $900 a piece). My thought is that we can gauge art interest/quality with the few pieces and then revisit adding more pieces per results and success. \n\n2. To a point you made within the proposal: good art takes time (you mention 16 pieces will take months) - I would rather you get the funding to begin this project as soon as possible (with quality art in mind) given we have a lot of great technical releases in process that could work alongside whyDecred.com in getting the word out/building community.\n\n3. Speaking from a withDecred perspective, I think there is absolute collaboration that can be done synergistically with whyDecred. I really like the differentiated marketing approach (art+education+community+tangibles/merchandise) that whyDecred is proposing and think this has potential. \n\n-Cap","signature":"87e0eec9d36376fdd36fb5edd0d8c377a7e3c8113564d7eb341ed4f3d83cbd9dc523b59036ba2e4cfc6700b90a0b3c3a27e161d6a58892c0550a37d37272330e","publickey":"7fcfcb798a74f8c6e3334452b5e150559a5571d020ff38e970fb3c08d027a271","commentid":"5","receipt":"fa2d779c7c07834f53e1642061504834b092abe82ceb03fb12806ab181083ea15d76e786964cd211bd7db993ef4a823abce9a7db7a1355b4991ec9cdbc269d0b","timestamp":1605205539,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm glad you like it and I am honored by your kind words.\n\n1. If more people echo this sentiment of budgeting fewer pieces to start, I can amend my proposal to start with fewer pieces. So far you and checkmate have expressed interest in funding fewer pieces to start. What do the others think about this?\n\n2. That is why we will hire many different artists, to go as fast as we can! [As I mentioned in my Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/), the Treasury artwork for example started August 4th and the final piece was completed October 1st. So sometimes these detailed works take some time to paint. Artists don't like to be rushed, and if they can enjoy and savor the process they can make better art. It is like making love, spending quality time and going the distance makes everything better!\n\n3. I absolutely agree! I'm excited to share marketing data with you guys, share specific conversion rates, and explore all the ways we can collaborate together in the future as we go along. We can link back to you for some of your longer form content. I'm sure many ideas will continue to come to us.","signature":"c23644f069b1453f4a0768edba75008f28a88b6db669be08fe69c7b483391fd0c98de820d2dbe5b0bf4826581d7672cd8b8f6bc78c72dfd1074843f4f5ae0e0e","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"6","receipt":"08b3b18201d04e7c15b8ef05432288c4b14c627a785184031246bffe118e0609478a643ef1ba9950638c8c78d6a5a322ab9cdab6acb5a5bb1f2d4f5dd24ce70c","timestamp":1605206805,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So there is 6.4k saved. And we let all the artists know that 1 grand prize winner will be picked out of the 16 and they will receive 6-7k (or some other number). Make some kind of contest out of it to garner some extra attention. How will the winner be chosen? I am not sure. Could politeia be used? And as the voting ensues it would allow the artists to sweat the outcome and get more familiar with politeia. Not sure if you could do it based on likes/retweets or twitter voting since it can be gamed. \n\nOr just one big contest, perhaps on an art forum without hiring artists. Each piece of artwork that gets used on the website gets 200$. And perhaps we could do a politeia vote where we each pick 1 out of the 16 and the top three vote getters get 5k/3k/2k.\n16*200=3200\n5k+3k+2k=10k\ntotal cost =13.2k instead of 14.4k\n\nSome of this seems kind of involved but just throwing around some ideas.\n\nI am also fine with the way you have it laid out and this looks like a solid proposal to me.","signature":"47866a27886f77eb3dfc082ad0402b961b35f4b9524758224e51690b402c82d9ff46cae7444812eb4b1bcda92fa5113efc0f9ed671ed8eb98aa40f7c25122206","publickey":"91c82be3a06c4037ee123a1c28b99f1f00aeb8d4715e402f2b4c9ca1406b4f3e","commentid":"7","receipt":"09ab87ecd07e6dbf896c43a03e4ed1b7c08194c685f991c15774764cc66666a2e1de3dd5f6f5092d64cfe65dfa60a6fbf8e55de938bdb63f09e283dcb9a25607","timestamp":1605207544,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Making a contest sounds interesting. Conversations like this enrich the project so I thank you. Here are my thoughts:\n\n* Maybe we can make contests and give away art reprints to the community, in exchange for some sort of engagement or work or activity! \n* If we make a contest and lower our payout to the artists, we would fail to attract many of the top artists. A few hundred dollars dramatically changes the quality of the art. The best artists are in demand and they might not participate for lower pay. \n* Better art will probably also sell more. I see it like Apple products, the artistic investment will be returned. I want you to be very proud about the art piece you hang on your wall!\n* There is something special about making something the best you can, it is more inspiring. Trusting and going at it with everything you've got... this will help us inspire and convert more Decredizens. I would personally lose a bit of motivations thinking we are not making the best art we can. If I feel proud it helps me work at my best. I can't imagine myself being this passionate about XRP, for example.\n* Artists could fail us, disappear or turn something awful. In these instances I would have to repay myself and start again with another artist. I would absorb this risk myself. I don't think this will happen but it could.\n* There are many costs I am not billing directly, see \"Free Items for the Community\".\n* I secretly plan to make more than the 16 art pieces with this funding, but don't tell anyone yet ;) I plan to add a surprise Meme section and have some top arts there too. The meme section would simply pump Decred in a more emotional way, not as squarely logical as the other pieces. I suspect these might be the best sellers of our art store.\n* If we pay and attract top talent, and build a high traffic, famous site, we can later leverage this and our artistic reputation and have artists maybe work for less, in exchange of the status and exposure we can provide them. Maybe we can even attract art in the spirit of making the world better, for free. But for now I think we should pay and build ourselves first.\n* Thanks again for the contest idea, I will keep it in mind :)","signature":"2e7a18f77f6dbd2065822fb83e7df7013f7202668cb683c8b8b9efed61cd1ed21ae7fc8f77a2932e49e6ca7835460adb3a1aed5ffd362ba99080915a654ca10e","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"8","receipt":"09817a4ffcd289c6dddac2e543d79c511373a6e89b18c9d73dc986725890f973c5700ae18288d95674a1a98c18ac4058fa95101041b8d0e942ad11b5b73b390c","timestamp":1605210605,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here are my comments:\n\n* Imagine pausing and freezing a frame from a movie. It might look strange, out of context. But it's not, you're simply not looking at the full, completed picture.\n* I've been analyzing what images Decredizens post on Twitter. They are different in nature from the core arts* of our site. The images people post on Twitter are made to stand alone by themselves, but  WhyDecred's core arts are made to stand together and tell a story. Once the site is complete, the pieces will create a coherent story in a context. Currently the site and arts are not complete.\n* We will add a simple meme section with wall-worthy art, which will appeal to Decredizens in a quick glance. I think you will like these pieces. These will be the type of art you can relate to as individual pieces. \n* We are building a new, interesting rabbit hole for people to journey in. It is a new context, a new lens into Decred and fiat currency.\n* It's a good sign you comment this, it means we are truly doing something new.\n* Simpler art pieces are definitely coming.\n* All arts are different, have different styles and are from different artists. Not all will be as complex as the treasury one. That piece is deep and rich, like our treasury.\n* Some people appreciate the deepness of the pieces and all the meaning behind them.\n* The Corrupt Bailouts and Handouts one is much simpler, for example.\n\nI would also like to extend an invitation for us to have the humility to see that if we do not understand why the top art pieces of the world like the Mona Lisa you mention are so expensive and valuable, then maybe we have something new to learn and understand. Cheers man and thanks for the feedback.\n\n* A core art is defined as the art pieces in List 1 and 2. Core art come in lists, they are made to tell a story across multiple images. Meme art is defined as art that is not part of a list and is designed to stand with relevancy by itself.","signature":"288eefc4d7840007068a10814af2aaff767f9a1cd0e981c0ae720ae5cf3615d8fe6f935d108dd50c64d833f82ec32d983c10a760890f32011e2b520f33700d00","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"15","receipt":"681272f71bed9a781ae97a9bc6fb1aa444eb5b692cd2ca8bf263b54b5691d63d9072a3c84d03b155bf15b5de755931ecbfbc40b5afc051f5c52078a77c643a05","timestamp":1605563093,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

For the website, you can make the code open source, and better still if it's a static site with an open source code repository it is easy for someone else to reproduce the site if your server goes down for any reason. To put it another way, when the code is open source and re-deployable, the project has a more robust asset that we can be confident will be available into the future. Without this kind of licensing and provision Decred has only whatever happens to be at the whydecred.com domain, which as the owner you retain full control over. I learned to use Hugo to make my own treasury-funded [sites](https://github.com/block-commons/) open source, with a license that allows them to be re-used.\n\nFor the artwork it might be more complicated, as you plan to sell prints and also the originals at some stage. I guess you could still release it under a license that allows for non-commercial use by others, so that the site could be re-hosted but not the shop. There is also a question about whether you or the artist would have ownership of the artwork. \n\nWith the current scale of the proposal (16 pieces, $6,800 funding) it would be good to get some assurances on the licensing before moving forward.","signature":"ad4cd236212d5d058788ba59673f8375dad52ebb0d90a609a0011e3c113a5249e4eb0360038a5a2629f04d1b822494f4f426f57a916e21ecd2813a3a800fd303","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"19","receipt":"31f0102cf8b51c62dac149c8ee14b3dcdcce43c23dc793d62ba32d51385124e30f2cbd1590eaa42a1bbbb358643090cb8d0837fb81fbef1bc5821978b7beb805","timestamp":1605643821,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Anyone can read the website and see the art for free. It's more like a free-to-enter Decred museum where you learn about Decred and fiat currency, and you can optionally buy products. If you do make a purchase, we keep at most half the profit in order to keep running the store, and at most 33% when we sell an original art piece. Decred will always have the same amount of profit as us, and this will be spent according to the wishes of the community.\n\nThe way I see it, it's like any other marketing initiative, where we can spend monthly in promotion/communication, expect that with this one we can actually make a bit of our money back. I see you as a shareholder and partner. If I really wanted to make money, I would market products for Bitcoin, and I'm not because I believe in sound governance. It's more than making money for me.","signature":"1116ac5cf933c4d78b7ed84d7fc92e01696a129b18233c4dd95a41c834e2587570232f235791014357d88e17b7ff38b6e5819f016e02ceb630fb71bd44453905","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"21","receipt":"88623abcc94f74e849d943ebf6b69c7bbc813a56df67483af9e935755b0a5e57c244cd197f1b59a6b9e2b4faf4c4bc2499059b46d53f87cdb8ec6956cd85070e","timestamp":1605651145,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The whole take on mashing together fine art / art investment sector with commercial illustration work for marketing is super off-putting. If you make a case of reliably selling originals commissioned by an artist at a 70% margin (ie. ‚Äì ie. 900 / 3000 $) of the production cost and whatever you sell the merch for, then you could already fund the project. \n\nAs the project relies on illustration work, the starting point absolutely needs to be presenting the portfolios of the actual illustrators/artists involved, as well as whoever does the art direction. This is the most common and efficient way to assess ones ability and track record. Otherwise pig in the bag situation. \n\nListing a bulk of work ‚Äúfor free‚Äù while the showcased demo site is nothing attractive and looks like it's been thrown together over an evening. This does not create any confidence on rest of the \"free\" items being of quality.\n\nI personally get zero impression from the showcased pieces. Pi one looks on a quick glance like little mermaid fanart, and has little relevance to marketing DCR or crypto in general. The symbolism and metaphors don't make much sense for explaining these matters well. From a purely technical standpoint, using the hand-drawn artwork as such for basis on a wide range of collateral as described is not really optimal.\n\nIn terms of pricing, 900 USD can be very reasonable if we talk about well-established illustrators and properly defined use rights. Typically these are not set for unlimited follow-up commercialization. Pricing for fine art and the investment art sector is a whole other ballgame to begin with. Based off the showcased work and proposed plans, I find it unlikely that the marketing efforts with these pieces would bring anywhere as much results as described.","signature":"25ebcf040c7f9c96b70f2e94bd76247023da9c7051118e0fe768a56d749edccf443cbc567bfb8b4f30b5f1b5de0f434bf169704832035045d690bd1156ab3f0c","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"23","receipt":"f9a3dbd18ddc721098999f946da9a5074aab16b1278f928d20f18c63ec13cd7f1757726ec0ff391410e9fbc4adbf2a8333e032f617493b4b182c1e393b598c07","timestamp":1605655305,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The high quality art option won by 63% to 37%, meaning 70% more people said HIGH quality is better instead of LOW, price included. 37% + 70% = 63%.\n\nLeaving aside debate as to overall concept which has merit and the hosting and license detail and the debates over whether or not the treasury should fund art, the central issue here is a simple one. The quality of the art is poor.\n\nI agree with  [Atwieden's](https://proposals.decred.org/user/87635997-9d54-4059-b3d2-aa483c7c9077) point, if you're going to do this and have any chance of making any sort of impact outside of the existing community you need to be able to land the art as real cultural moments.\n\nRight now the benchmarks are pretty high - [this ](https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/1 )is not far off the standard of the sort of stuff I'd expect to see. \n\nBeeple is well known in digital art circles and has a [big following on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/) and therefore if you commission someone like him, you actually reach out of the bubble.\n\nThere are other ways to go about this - curating younger up and coming artists who would have some pre-existing audiences but who would be happy to have a smaller commission. This could be mediated through someone like [MoCDA](https://www.instagram.com/beeple_crap/) who I know.\n\nYou have identified some potential topical areas, but the issue you'll find, is that if you want to get really great visual artists  then you should let them intepret Decred's proposition through their own lens, because ultimate that is exactly what you're paying for... artistic interpretation, else you may as well just use a bunch of cheap graphic designers and call it a brief.\n\nIt looks like you've spent a fair amount of time, but the fundamental issue is not really the  basic concept, but the quality. \n\nDo you have a strategy for onboarding a higher quality of artist? \n\nAs an FYI, part of the [MetaDAO concept ](https://commonwealth.im/edgeware/proposal/discussion/513-metadao-pooling-onchain-funding-for-public-good-proposals) which has now been funded by Edgeware will be going towards outlining a cross-chain initative around the funding of digital art where Decred could provide some funding in return for being a member of a non-profit (that does not mean there wouldn't be value returned to the treasury as dividends), therefore benefitting from collective awareness across a range of communities.","signature":"4c5ccc893cc2a8395cf425c4e885eea3f8776fc0aba637296784e0e5d601b89f2e3b65668bf4d934d87f896f124a0dd2ea3ba24663aa746eac09cabbe37d650c","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"27","receipt":"ab46acfc8445a8e03ee09c0b4701be1206ff6131fa1cfe5e41a070b1670ff79ff8678c4e41447e753d1570ace1999c47afbfa067e63633a54e2efdd208cca500","timestamp":1605700872,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Ideally, not only brain. Also, just imagine what kinds of people we can attract/onboard through art.\n\n\u003e Target our marketing at people of the world with moral values.\n\nThis is the best, or even the only way to go IMO.\n\nWhen I look back at our first attempt to write up [messaging](https://github.com/decredcommunity/outreach/blob/release/foundational-messaging.md), it feels like focusing on \"technical\", \"investors\" or \"mainstream\" audience is missing the point. Same for \"institutional\" and \"traders/speculators\". I don't know how to say it, but all these definitions are too \"dry\" in a way. They miss something important and may fail to work because of some intangible property of Decred.\n\nThere are people with moral values out there and they are our audience, however \"naive\" this may sound. They can share any of the categories listed above, but \"moral values\" should be the tuning to use.\n\nIf I were to compress \"Why Decred?\" it would be: \"In Decred my vote has power\" or \"Decred puts me close to consequences of my actions, good or bad\". \"Honest money and honest governance\" is pretty decent too. This doesn't sound sellable or exciting for anyone looking to get rich quick and/or avoid responsibility and have things decided for them. But it might be the core feature we can and should \"sell\", regardless of how many people buy it.\n\nThere are many movements for Austrian school/autonomy/sovereignty/privacy/etc with whom we are highly [aligned](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#reach-people-to-whom-it-really-matters) but are not connected while we dwell in our bubble. I guess we simply don't have enough ambassadors who could introduce Decred to these groups. For example, imagine if [these people](https://mises.org/about-mises/what-is-the-mises-Institute) would suddenly learn that something they have been theorizing is actively being built (and is already functioning for a small group of pioneers).\n\nI am hopeful that the world is changing for the better and \"demand\" for moral values will increase significantly.\n\n\u003e Target high follower count individuals who might appreciate Decred and our stand on honest money\n\nThis is the best way to get any visibility I am aware of. I think it will get easier to detect these people by their position (and actions!) on the problems the world is facing today, i.e. we want those who don't buy lies and propaganda, stay reasonable and consistent.\n\nLatest version 4 is a generous offer. Absorbing proposal's expenses is not a requirement to win a vote, but it will be appreciated by the stakeolders and everyone who has put many personal hours into Decred.

Is there anything special about number _24_ for each list of problems/solutions?\n\n2\\. Do you plan to sell merch from the store? [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/) was more explicit about it (\"We will make an online store that pairs the art with clothing, posters, ...\") than this proposal.\n\n3\\. Will the store support DCR as a payment method (with a nice discount to incentivize use)?\n\n\u003e Make our sales transparent, with public item and timestamp reporting, so that anyone can audit us by making a purchase.\n\n4\\. Couldn't understand this. Is making a purchase required to audit?\n\n\u003e When an original art piece is sold, we agreed with the artists to give them a third of the sale, a third for us and a third for the WhyDecred project fund.\n\n5\\. Would it be feasible to give more % to the artist?\n\n\u003e Showcase our team of 16+ artists, 12+ translators\n\n6\\. Do you mean you have so many people for this proposal, or do you refer to Decred's existing artists and translators?\n\n7\\. More generally, introducing the team would help. That is, define who is \"we\" used throughout the proposal.\n\n8\\. Do you have experience in building up traffic for new websites, leading art projects, etc?\n\n9\\. [Flippa link](https://flippa.com/users/992972) requires login. Is there any other public link to check?\n\n10\\. Is there any concern with mixing an educational resource with a store? I assume you will separate these areas somehow. How about isolating the store at `store.withdecred.com` or `shop.withdecred.com` subdomain?\n\n11\\. What underlying servies do you plan to use for the store to not build all infrastructure from scratch (shipping/printing/etc)? Is it Printful and Printify that you mentioned? Can you please expand a bit how it works?","signature":"ff592dcaf3932bb5446101b3f5a68dcd0c0ddd76ffeadb123a192fa1c7e707540a0cba6033ac583b070cbc7a3be206882c302c417ea2e13cb5550e99d16b7006","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"35","receipt":"36a6d3d5fee6b47c8bc203eb69a0344659fc6d1397d161b40559e1ec7acc9fa0e1cf1c00bc4780b6e30a82dbc134792eceec41a6a6d8c4982e46a75216ea9b00","timestamp":1605757353,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I recommend not injecting any third party tracking into whydecred.com and follow the approach taken by [withdecred.org](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2bf72e6) (self-hosted privacy-preserving analytics).\n\n\u003e This investment is guaranteed to increase the Decred price and amount of users by more than 0.056%.\n\n2\\. I recommend to have no expectations and to not hype up anyone's expectations regarding your impact on the price of DCR. You may do everything right and it will still drop because turning an entire market is too big of a task for one small group. The idea is worth pursuing regardless of whether this project increases the value of DCR by 0.056% :) To be honest, I would remove all talk about % of the Treasury.\n\n\u003e Cannot be Confiscated\n\n3\\. It is still possible to confiscate via device hacking or extortion. I would say \"much harder to confiscate compared to physical cash, digital fiat and gold\".\n\n4\\. Our community members produced tons of quality content and built a few websites over the years. Getting real views and traffic on content remains our biggest marketing challenge. I recommend to not rely on \"others will share my content\" as the main strategy since it did not bring huge results. I hope you have that magic many of us do not.\n\n5\\. Please be aware that Treasury payments are done in DCR and may deviate from the USD amount billed. This happens to be most inconvenient for compensating external expenses denominated in USD and all of the volatility risk falls on the contractor.","signature":"373b00f4d4d0a7623ab72c156f84edf2d05f9454ff8ff45487e96d51aa7a34982d5d197246aa73efe3ec756d6da44fb8e72db16597693d5e3478eee281259306","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"36","receipt":"f9a19ee814c8c5adc4ccb5ed44b37637dc739c97ec2176ada06aa84511316cc797caa9936e741eaba583f70be5c86a3a2e4829363bf76bc23c670931daae2a03","timestamp":1605757869,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We don't want micro-proposals for each small element.\n\nYou mean like the PR firm we hired that one time? How'd that go for us? Why is marketing uniquely the only thing in Decred where seemingly annointed yet faceless unknown people can get together in large groups, talk a big game and then churn out absolutely pitiful results again, and again, and again?\n\n\u003e The point of paying for any new marketing initiative is to keep trying until we find what works.\n\nKeyword: \"new\".

It's *unbelievable*.\n\n\u003e I'm looking forward for your groundbreaking marketing proposal what will actually work.\n\nHere it is: fire everyone who has ever been paid for marketing Decred in any capacity. Their efforts have culminated in the price of DCR tanking to nearly all-time bitcoin lows, which is the only metric that matters in this industry. I'd even amend the constitution to ban all future treasury spends relating to marketing. Marketing is the Home Ec of the business world. Anyone can do it, and if you can't do it for free in a world where attention is driven by organic community activity, then you simply don't know the first thing about cryptocurrency valuation, and have absolutely no business being tangentially involved in marketing cryptocurrency as such.","signature":"402e5b247ad5e469bf482ae30c4950ae9d743c4b70cf63930f92c2f319f14eafb60aecb6ce2f00186731b4f384fc7a0c6078b2cb846df0ffd016f5fd298b6804","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"37","receipt":"98a30fcf325f8dfd10ee10e311b6f796ea52fe85fda057a130396d86e60a8e95c1437f21351a33e251457ab2dcfe72f51a5ab2168e6699eba0278cbe36380b03","timestamp":1605757901,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

To wake them up the message must be very clear, backed by evidence that is simple to understand and recognize in real life.\n\nA sub-project of WhyDecred could be to compile historical evidence showing how fiat money tends to collapse sooner or later. I didn't study this in depth but the few instances I [looked into](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hjsgg1/the_federal_reserve_a_blatantly_rigged_game/) indicate that the power to create money has been abused for [centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome#Crisis_of_the_Third_Century). One big list/subsite could help make it obvious that \"Nope, we have tried it so many times and it always fails\". If there have been any instances of non-inflationary/deflationary systems we need to learn about them too. If there have been none or too few (compared to collapsed inflationary currencies), it poses an ugly question to \"economists\" preaching that price inflation is healthy, \"why do you keep pushing a system we know does not work and not suggesting to try something new instead?\".\n\nArt pieces could also work nicely here, e.g. embed existing historical art depicting money abuse, or even draw some \"retroactive\" art pieces for that historical events.\n\nThat [rocket](https://twitter.com/ParisSmithson/status/1323071545867120641) pic looks cheaper than the other one, but it is a good metaphor. The rocket ejects fiat to drive those piloting it to success at the cost of everybody else who gets left behind with tons of useless paper. Might be worth developing this concept into a full piece?\n\nHow about making a high quality video with art pieces as slides with a voice over reading text about money/crypto/Decred?\n\nHow about augmenting the art pieces with some puzzles posted at [winatoms](https://twitter.com/winatoms)? The puzzles could ask non-trivial questions on each of the discussed topics and the winner would get a bit of DCR (while using smart contracts behind the scenes). It might even be possible to embed winatoms' text fields to remove cross-site barrier. Note that the site is not finished.\n\nConsider posting a bunch of designs on [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/). I heard they have good service.\n\n---\n\nBest of luck with this project!","signature":"82b2e7660f90224e79af1e3b8948536443a7caf9512d329d53556f037de34fad33e32005484dacd7510c4dd7ec457a2a5899973915e3f7ed2418b843fc2dcb0a","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"38","receipt":"b143e2ade4d22ff2be98a586d1381e18cc85c80f95ecc21717fee35f6cb153fe36de1d2bb4a6d1f16f2e36aba64e19f033a6e80e5849883ebcbbec480aef2f0a","timestamp":1605758471,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We can cover a lot of ground in terms of historic moments related to governance and especially money. So many iconic moments we could paint. We can be an educational resource and rank in Google for related historic search terms. This is a sustainable way to acquire traffic and bring new people to Decred. So I can search \"zimbabwe trillion dollar bill\", \"crisis del fobaproa\" or \"crash of 1929\" and we can appear in the rankings and bring people to our site.\n* I like your thoughts on the rocket art! You inspired in me the image of people drowning under the paper ejected by the rocket. \n* I also thought about a video compiling all the art pieces, zooming into them and panning across them, with a voice narrating something interesting. We should definitely do this too at some point. Perhaps someone in the community will step up. \n* I didn't know about Winatoms, sounds interesting! Maybe even a parallel proposal could do this.\n* Red Bubble is an option we are looking at along with things like Teespring, Printful, Printify, etc.","signature":"f6b224b073aa145291c4aaac8e3476f0d0418ce01c4a5b9a55664478428359ffb7ecf63e89844f62cfbc90535b0b73cbc5e411e85929de0ab129a3ac4140f706","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"41","receipt":"35c09628e248455258b15d5a577b4537eee7393755e4506feea7478588863ef588015d82661cdd5c3bdabe89d09edf2556f26c0914a2f3fdedd322c8e8ef360f","timestamp":1605823011,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Thank you for these suggestions. I believe extortion is a release of funds stemming from a personal decision to accept to yield before a threat, and therefore not confiscation because it is ultimately decided by you to yield. We are not saying \"extortion proof\" or \"hacker proof\" :) I believe these are different words meaning different things, correct me if you think I'm wrong. Confiscation is by an authority, extortion and hacking are done by a criminal.\n4. Oh no, definitely not.

The exact number is not certain but would be more than 24 for each in a full and very comprehensive list. But we can cover the basic ones to start.\n2. Yes, any merch from Printful and Prntify that makes sense. Why these providers? Because sales, production and shipping can be automated with them and the store hosted on our own site.\n3. I would love to do this, however Printful and Pritify require payment in USD for the base cost of the merch, so this might not be so easy to do. However we can definately accept DCR for the original art pieces and for any blockchain tokenized art originals. We can also accept DCR for any ebook we sell, in the case we don't give it away for free, which we might.\n4. Yes and no. I plan to release a table with all timestamped purchases, so this can be checked by anyone but this is a weak method of verifying. But if you make a purchase you will be able to verify how your transaction is recorded into this table, and this is a way to audit us. All sales will appear here. If we accept DCR to a specific address for some of the payments then this can be another way to audit us. I'm not sure how else we can be transparent about the store sales, but I would accept any method that is simple enough to implement.\n5. Yes. I am thinking of opening up each writing area/topic to any artist, and anyone can maybe submit art. If it is decent we can list it on the site, and maybe anyone can sell their original art pieces in a way that we do not pay for them upfront, only get a commission on a sale, say 30% cut, 70% for the artist. I believe this rate is standard for most art galleries. \n6. Since every piece will be ideally made by a different artist, I refer to all the 16 artists that will be chosen. I have not contacted the rest of the artists yet.  I also refer to the translators that will be chosen. \n7. Us is me and the artists and translators and marketers/social media advocates that will be assembled if the proposal passes, and generally anyone you comes on board as we move along. Currently I have nobody else to introduce but myself. I prefer to invite others once this proposal passes. I prefer certain invitations than maybe invitations regarding who I invite to work with me.\n8. Yes, I have experience building up traffic websites via SEO and link building. You can verify this on Flippa. I was able to build a 150k visits per month site with 1 week effort, and I can prove this with verifiable AdSense revenue and Google Analytics.\n9. Thanks for letting me know! Here is a link of what my profile looks like behind a login https://photos.app.goo.gl/1ZrWdpGkGgbW9aMa6 .\n10. No concerns here. We might separate the store, after I take a deep dive into the Shopify documentation and get my feet wet I'll decide.\n11. I plan to leverage Shopify since they have easy tools to connect to Printful and Printify. Basically a user comes to WhyDecred.com and makes a purchase. Our Shopify store bills their card and later pays us minus their small fee. An API call from Shopify creates the order at either Printful or Printify (P/P). P/P then charges my credit card for the base cost of the merch, and then proceeds to manufacture what the customer ordered and ship it to him/her, on demand. P/P also have a service in which they warehouse products for us and ship them for us, so we can expand to other things later if we decide to.\n\nLet me know if you have more questions bee, I'm happy to answer them all.","signature":"83033c052a70f2924b83ba2c8f3a8bbfc0e2d466bc0cbfc13ccff9277eb11cd658e0ade39908d6c8c13622afcb8e4b2b77293d8b338e1f3dea5450bfe7da4d08","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"44","receipt":"624ef29d2cdf7074cda286b7c6716f4555fa07337eecfa1f66c20e83e134662dc30041215f160382851c0d929f629b924f17b917555e09c96a9049d36f6a1f03","timestamp":1605830727,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Are you one of those defund everything types that wants to burn civilization down to the ground?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/shapeless_lee/status/1321523441468690433","signature":"6819b3a4088754862a2898ab6e58bbe307890e3bc925d55ed4ae445e1b133ced0d75816d5ad709a47049961d54a90441e25cc917396fc9653a88dfa2da8d3000","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"46","receipt":"6e0f7aeaae90f9615abee04bc4624d916bd376f21fbd025aea34b2362c0a37e3bd78ab0f2f06ad7bf4d1a58f46f4bece1c25219932c544ec68ebe8ab5b533001","timestamp":1605832032,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Many people loved the 2 pieces we did, others didn't. That's why we decided on artistic and creative diversity. I'm sure you will later find something you will truly like and I would bet that given enough art pieces, there will be something you would be proud to hang on your wall.\n* Capturing art as a cultural moment is a great idea. Keep in mind not all art pieces can do this though. But definitely a great idea echoed by bee as well.\n* The artist you propose has an impressive IG following. But consider he recently auctioned a piece covering the election for over $65k usd. How much would it cost us to hire someone like this? Just for a single post on his IG? Keep in mind that artists with high social counts price their art much higher, and it is not necessarily better art. The social count of the artists we hire is only one of our marketing strategies, not the only one nor the most important. There are many ways we can bring eyes to the site and I mentioned several of them.\n* We could definately leverage any contacts you have over at MoCDA, thank you. I also support hiring up and coming artists. That way we can explore our other marketing methods/tactics. \n* I agree we should let the artist interpret the piece somewhat. The mermaid idea was not mine, for example, it was the artists. I think women will love this piece, who by the way are alarmingly underrepresented in Decred. \n* I have spent much more time on this than probably anyone is imagining. I can see that you must have entrepreneurial experience yourself to have seen this. \n* Think about the women who will love the ocean scene. Do we have many women here on Politeia? I don't know of even one.\n* Sure, there are many ways to onboard an artist. We can pay them, we can let them sell their original piece on our store, we can inspire them from a moral standpoint, as a mission worth fighting for. We can offer them exposure and recognition, the more impressive artists we can work with, the more others will want to join our elite group. As Decred grows I predict artists will even work for free, just because they believe in this and are passionate about it. We can also attract them by helping them tokenize their digital originals and teach them about this. This last idea is new. There are more ways that will probably come to me as we move along. It is the nature of the creative process.\n* The MetaDAO concept looks interesting, can you message me on Twitter so you can explain this to me further?\n\nThanks and good luck to all the sincere DAO's out there.","signature":"690df925ff00ea48400b8dae48e60f6a4a4af93696ca46bac95cb0c89cda32a06f5b6df2cf35f167f37268af9ad804fc4a9c44be1a81c186f104aa2aeb524b09","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"48","receipt":"bc9a36830b5715fcd7fcadfd92e1b1eedf8806055d81b21b3b6058e16b2dfa6c4fe63e0dee2d2e8564dfb21ba7d875e969b2db45b22cca534d92bedbc22f7e0d","timestamp":1605834101,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This has existed in the past but until recently it has become more difficult with prior vendors discontinuing Decred related products. \n\n**Art Requirements:**\n\nI echo linnutee's sentiment in this regard as there are lots technicalities involved in art production that seem to be absent from this proposal. Is there a **Production Outline** for the project deliverables and a **Production Schedule** for the completion of these 16 art pieces.  Without these basic requirements how does any stakeholder here know when they are likely to see their investment realised?\n\n\u003e 16 high quality art pieces\n\nFrom the proposal I'm of the understanding that the production of these pieces will be outsourced?  Will the artist/artists responsible for the 2 past deliverables be responsible for the creation of the other pieces stated in this proposal? If not what is the **Vetting Procedure** for sourcing an additional artist?\n\nIs there **Redundancy Capacity** if (for example) one of the artist/artists falls ill or can no longer work on this proposal?\u003e\n\n\u003e  \"The Decred Treasury\" and \"Corrupt Bailouts and Handouts\".\n\nI assume that you're Art Directing this project? I was curious if there was any preliminary documents outlining how you came to the style undertaken and how it correlates with or deviates from Decred's core communication messages of  being a *\"Community-Directed, Superior Store of Value\"* which is *\"Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable\"*?\n\n**Licencing:**\n\nThis is a sticking issue as well.  Regardless of if the artists are outsourced or otherwise, they are their own sovereign individuals/entities: \n\n- What are the terms are they creating art within? \n- Where do things stand on the intellectual property front?\n\n- Who is \"We\" in this instance? \n- Who are the parties involved and accountable here? \n\n**Business Plan:**\n\nThe Decred treasury is funding a profit making enterprise here:\n\n\u003e \"The art store is a component of this proposal\"\n\nI'm not against Decred Treasury funds being used to finance businesses that support communication of the project but only if there is a plan and transparency on the functioning and sustainability of the enterprise funded.  There seems to be a severe lack of documentation in this regard.\n\nI requested further elaboration on this component through the submission of a **Business Plan** in the IRC #proposals channel however this has not been followed up so I am requesting this here on Politeia. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI believe that the merchandise store is an idea worth exploring.  However,  I'm not convinced this proposal is currently worth my vote based on the absence of the **components above**.\n\nI wish you all the best when this goes to vote.","signature":"438c7031939d2b0acb017fcc167694e70354bfe4052ecc6b8d4e211ebd0a9e0f843f4762e1415e304cc1cb0119ec5a83d0e27c0146a2ecb746a30beab8e2d00e","publickey":"538a1fcaf9621ac8e3b9be3d682478c1800add4b6bde085c4594919e34591126","commentid":"50","receipt":"0a0e89dbe635efd4056b5063b9d2a3a1c1fdd90ffc7035a0de3dea593116fa0480f07dbbd496f9e3ee3845e94bdc1e088fb9c7b0642898c47c16e81c4a9b7b06","timestamp":1605872640,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We decided to go the MVP route as outlined in my update. In consideration of your time, here are my answers:\n\n* The MVP will be delivered before the next proposal is published.\n* The MVP has no investor/stakeholder risk because it will be completed before the vote.\n* Yes, there will always be redundant capacity, including considerations to wild swings in the DCR price.\n* Yes, I am the Art Director.\n* We want to appeal to new audiences. The Decred Treasury was made to appeal to younger women.\n* For now the artists are releasing all rights to me in a signed contract. Later I can decide what to do with these rights. \n* \"We\" is me and the 2 artists who have collaborated up to this point. So 3 people. \"We\" includes anyone else who ends up working on this proposal. The MVP will probably contain work of over 12 people.\n* I am the one accountable.\n* We can explore the business plan in later proposals. For now the process has become simplified after my last update and the BP is no longer relevant for the MVP.\n* I wish all the best to you too. Thank you for the intelligent feedback.","signature":"6a31ef38e44fe22c785a9d2581a080e9e2c4891303e08c2052c409d03bb03b8c16215bdb34df85015b38f834a18df03da4e2064e88e5b680b83a36adc2748a04","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"51","receipt":"91a632681c75e8fc803f904ba230a284a74a87e967142994670acc863305d7141b8ce570ea9324bde70a9e112217f0a7b54d2100e9b728d2403e02125497410c","timestamp":1605938847,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It was convenient to have one contact person reporting on what the entire group was doing.\n\n\u003e How'd that go for us?\n\nIn retrospect I think it was a waste of money for the most part. We expected big presence in The Media mafia but it didn't happen. To be fair, the people were not faceless because they showed their faces quite a lot.\n\nNote that we cannot put all blame on marketing initiatives that failed our expectations. Who approved it? We approved it. When you give power to the people they will make mistakes with it. But I prefer making mistakes with power than having no power. It was painful to burn so much money that could have been spent much better, but I think we learned from it. Notice how approval percentages for most marketing proposals have declined and claimed budgets have reduced. In other words, it is much harder to \"sell\" marketing services to the stakeholders than it was 1-2 years ago.\n\nThis proposal is trying a different strategy and cannot be compared directly.\n\n\u003e At best, the proposer is rehashing a narrative from 2009 that went stale a good 6 years ago\n\nJust to make sure we discuss the same thing, the narrative I am reading in this proposal is that Decred is honest money with honest governance. I am not aware to what extent it was used since 2009 and what moment if it going stale 6 years ago do you refer to. It may sound naive and not exciting but I think it is a good one. The challenge is to deliver it. Do you have a better narrative to suggest?\n\n\u003e gas lighting people into believing the lie that this Little Mermaid ripoff artwork designed by clear amateurs\n\nIt is fair to criticize the quality/style of the artwork but this one is not helpful. See comments by mrbulb and linnutee that were much more specific about what can be improved.\n\n\u003e Their efforts have culminated in the price of DCR tanking to nearly all-time bitcoin lows, which is the only metric that matters in this industry.\n\nYou claim unprovable and unknowable causality without any research. What if we do fire all marketing people and continue sliding down to 10k sat for the next 2 years?\n\n\u003e Anyone can do it, and if you can't do it for free in a world where attention is driven by organic community activity, then you simply don't know the first thing about cryptocurrency valuation\n\nI do not believe current cc valuation and attention is driven by organic community activity.\n\nWhat free marketing are you doing for Decred?\n\n\u003e and have absolutely no business being tangentially involved in marketing cryptocurrency as such\n\nIf you have expertise in this area then feel free to submit a proposal. Or at least share some research where a comparable obscure altcoin had impactful organic free marketing that has led to \"proper\" BTC price.","signature":"9fa9b462dd85f74740253c954d148b5debcab7e69cf25ad75a7020254c762455057f4be6d91ac143846f8b576c89cfba503c79dd22be81915847c9dd761b5b0c","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"52","receipt":"084b9f3e7fd60dfcef1ae5d4035e47cdb9f2d2a3aaefb209204eec14a2e4c008be61c5ed00d8c8e5922f5602941efa225f3d6f1746801ed4415d428802b18f08","timestamp":1605981941,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So that Google doesn't know how much traffic we have?\n\nThe concern is not so much about Google knowing too much about your site. It is about protecting the visitors. Unfortunately, \"I just want to track the data, so let's inject a bit of these third parties, what could go wrong?\" is the default today and pretty much nobody questions this approach. But since you enter a geek community, here we go :)\n\nThe privacy aspect is that third party analytics fingerprint the hell out of the device and collect visit data. Modern browser bloat and sloppy defaults facilitate so many ways to track users _across_ websites with high accuracy.\n\nThe security aspect is that visitor's browser executes proprietary, likely obfuscated, third party tracking code that might contain bugs and security exploits.\n\nThe ethical aspect is, when I visit your site, it does not feel right if you invite a stash of third parties to snoop on our interaction that is supposed to be between you and me (or, my client and your server).\n\n\u003e It seems self hosted data can be easily manipulated by the host and be less trustworthy.\n\nYou could also manipulate Google Analytics by directing bot visits to your site. Both are not too trustworthy but I prefer first-party analytics. Good thing is that there are several open source solutions today.\n\n\u003e Confiscation is by an authority, extortion and hacking are done by a criminal.\n\nTrue. The line may get blurry if authorities decide to exploit a known vulnerability in your system to confiscate the coins. Anyway, the point I was making is \"Cannot be confiscated\" may give a false expectation of absolute security. Marketing materials often simplify things so it really depends on the situation if my longer version fits.","signature":"c908ea1a43abe6111eb61c0362e8390e7b836d6402d3e3d09475b4230fefc121062c8c9d1320282f43c9067e58d9677cfa803fd93e5bb693b3f5ef784a99ab03","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"54","receipt":"7ca9127b2fad927d0dcdea532c2990f6939b9b18ce6684c68010930827adda6e6e5a560df7bfba0a6f96dea49bf23a9917f37791e3c73d707fb3c17d3d2d4306","timestamp":1605984062,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

How? The buyer can simply see if their transaction was recorded or not. The publicly auditable table will display:\n\n* When the purchase was made, day, month, year, hour, minute, second.\n* Where the purchase was made, country.\n* What was purchased, what items.\n* If desired by the buyer and provided by him/her, the social network link of the buyer.\n* The buyers would agree to have these data points published before paying. There is no personally identifiable info here.\n\nI think this makes it 100% trustable. I can't see how we could cheat if we provide this.","signature":"ec053a043f48e080fa50e85e557bbf35f4d0482dd19f3b06bf90760418213a4c169ccc1f7fca7eff4da6398e662b4909729e03aa341fd8214bf642ce1cd97602","publickey":"5e8b2261d0c8fc18844094b5386fd398c828cec2db1bce7de0e4843d37c6028f","commentid":"58","receipt":"7720242de4dbe1872a0ca2694e6f5ab42cbd523944d957a609fb83bb4927edfb1bf39806fdbff147bb78e798bcc64caa7918f3c780afd3144bd23ab66d557d0b","timestamp":1605990626,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
