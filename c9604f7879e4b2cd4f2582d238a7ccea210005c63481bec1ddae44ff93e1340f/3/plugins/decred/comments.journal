If 24 housr to \"announce \u0026 establish the liquidity target\" is sub-optimal, perhaps it could be extended to say, 48 hours, 5 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks?

If those look good, a follow up full blown proposal will be a good competition to the second term of the MM. Or it could even hire the existing MM via this new process.","signature":"8f5c5d2fad1c660d7e90101323ce6dc6e4f8a766a359598f9048a42e8059dbb735a53793306aa2d288d4d8dbb99730508145a1a969d10f6bdf521dfd8eaf2d00","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"6","receipt":"b6d4137ae5486c9ac9fe757b6a730d8b53979b869be3eac7d85bffa1ab9c3e5f57dffe66a66cb82f864f49652a4e3372048aa2953a77c4d3702b8f0abe5e5209","timestamp":1567292102,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

He and I have been chatting about it this afternoon, and he felt that if/when the community wanted to get behind a proposal like this, it should be a contractor and not himself.\n\n\u003eStaffing:\n\u003ewho will build the missing automated tools?\n\nWhy do the tools need to be automated at the outset.  When SEC/FINRA shows up to audit a broker dealer or ATS, a lot of the checking is manual, and they've been in the business of auditing trading operations for years. :-)\n\n\u003echecking records is a ton of not very fun work, requires tools we likely \u003edon't have atm\n\nAgree, automated would def be better!   If we were to go down this road finding a Decred MM Community Overseer with skills to automate the oversight process would be hugely advantageous!\n\n\u003e who will do the oversight job?\n\nAssuming JZ is not interested, there are likely a few people in the community who would be interested.\n\n\u003e who will manage and push this whole thing forward? (betterfuture I assume?)\n\nProbably not me directly. \n\nI submitted the proposal out of a feeling of fear for the well-being of the project and wanting to help offer another option to creating a more sustainable medium- to long-term solution for engaging MMs.\n\nMy fear is that if we consolidate to a single firm too early then it eliminates the benefit of creating a competitive environment, comparing results from a few of the firms, and being more incrementalist in price discovery. \n\nAlso, at end of 6 months, one MM firm will have an information \u0026 experience advantage, \u0026 could potentially hold us hostage, right at the time when we need to go thru the whole process again to find a more long-term solution, which is not a favorable situation for the project to be in.   That being said, probably we can get through it OK, and the risks of not doing something at all and losing the progress we've made through JZ's process might be just as bad.\n\n\u003e Will vendors jump through the hoops?\n\nimho, it is just a question of price discovery to find the price point where the market will bring us the solution that we've specified, and possibly this will go down over time as expertise builds up.\n\nOversight/verification will be crucial: is it theoretically possible to determine after the fact that MM did a good job and did not cheat?\n\nFair question.  Its worth discussing.  We have the same problem with the current batch of Tantra, Grape, and I2 proposals, btw.\n\n\u003eWhat is the spending cap for this program? \n\nPerhaps we can discuss this question after the first 6-month MM trial period when we have more knowledge?\n\n\u003eHow to choose which players will fit and get paid and which will not?\n\nI was assuming it would be first come, first served, per exchange and trading pair combination (ETPC), with a need for only one MM per each ETPC. Basically, if the MM meets the specification we've set, then they can perform the function as long as they like and get paid.   If they fail to meet any of the specs this constitutes an \"Error\" and if they commit two Errors they lose the trading pair and cannot re-bid for 30 days, and another MM can pick it up.\n\n\u003e Is it fair to say this is a \"market maker bounty program\"?\n\nThat's a very nice refinement to the framing of it! \n\n\u003e Incentives: we are hiring a market maker out of necessity. Most other coins do it, it did not happen (enough) by itself for DCR, so we have to pay a MM now. I hope that at some point DCR markets will grow big enough that a Treasury-paid MM will be no longer necessary. However, if we run this program it might train a lot of players that Treasury is willing to fund this forever.\n\nGood point.  Maybe it should be something we review periodically? Say, every 24 months?\n\n\u003eHow I would proceed\n\u003eRight now I think we need to move on with existing MM proposals, hold a vote and secure an MM for 6 months. A lot of effort was made to bring us this close to improving liquidity, that work and opportunity should not be wasted.\n\nAgreed, JZ and I discussed this afternoon, and I reached a similar conclusion through my discussion with him.  Here's what I said in our chat:  \"If one of your MM proposals goes ahead, probably $240k over 6 months isn’t going to break the Treasury, and i agree we will gain significant knowledge.\" \n\n\u003eDuring the oversight of the selected MM we will develop tools and ways that will be useful in context of this proposal as well.\n\u003eIn parallel with the selected MM doing his job, advance this \"MM market\" idea.\n\u003edevelop this idea further: collect more feedback (incl. from real MMs), refine processes\n\nAgreed, how about we let this new proposal sit here and gather feedback for 1-2 months, including gathering feedback from MMs and expressions of interest from potential Decred MM Community Overseer candidates, and then look at it all again once everyone has had a chance to weigh in?\n\nIn the meantime, the existence of this new proposal certainly shouldn't slow down momentum towards JZ closing out his process!","signature":"1a0a71196be9414b388c0f37f0cb4673167be81566a893e236290fdbba481e03c8bff3bcf2d0fbf478fd63043faa077bc3fcadfad032bd93b998eff885a68b0b","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"7","receipt":"0f76eda2c5f3275baaac08f3949a69f54c2c4b0393abcda16fb303b9937870bc9da81ff062d9eb8c6907fdda87d64c90ab824e7da1606433b634f594126ba104","timestamp":1567317856,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Of course it can start all manual.\n\nAutomation would make the process more productive and less boring. As a bonus, having tools may attract people for the job who would otherwise reject to do it manually. I believe it is super important to free humans from tedious work to keep them creative and motivated.\n\n\u003e Probably not me directly.\n\nOk the reason I ask this is, from my experience, if you want something novel to happen, get ready to lead and put in consistent effort for months, alone. Hopefully people will join but you need to have that strong intent inside. It takes time for people to 1) see that you are serious and 2) begin to appreciate and understand the idea. Without this, I have observed many good ideas stall.\n\nIn case of existing MM work, it has that strong leadership and effort from JZ and others who have won my trust by doing, doing and doing.\n\n\u003e if we consolidate to a single firm too early then it eliminates the benefit of creating a competitive environment, comparing results from a few of the firms, and being more incrementalist in price discovery\n\nI don't think so. The way I see incrementalism is we get something working first, and then build a better solution _while having_ that something working for our benefit. This is how a lot of things were done: Pi started as a central server but had brought an incredible amount of value already, the chain was started without many cool features, DEX and privacy will start as a central servers, etc.\n\nAs Decred grows it may need more and more MM services, and putting all eggs in one basket will be a bad idea. Having multiple competing contractors will always be an attractive switch.\n\nI'd like to have MM bounty program deployed yesterday, but we simply don't have it, it requires more refinement and people, while I'd like to see MM start their work ASAP.\n\n\u003e end of 6 months, one MM firm will have an information \u0026 experience advantage, \u0026 could potentially hold us hostage, right at the time when we need to go thru the whole process again to find a more long-term solution\n\nWe will need to approve holding us hostage via Pi.\n\nThere is no requirement to wait 6 months and an uncomfortable position to develop a long-term solution. It can start today. In fact it has already started with this proposal. But it needs consistent effort to make it happen, now or later.\n\n\u003e if the MM meets the specification we've set, then they can perform the function as long as they like and get paid\n\nWhere I was getting at with \"spending cap\" question, is if a ton of MMs show up and pass all criteria, we can't pay them all. There must be a hard limit and some mechanism to decide which _qualifying_ players to reject (e.g. first come).\n\n\u003e Maybe it should be something we review periodically? Say, every 24 months?\n\nThat's too long for crypto space. I'd say review it every 6 months just like the bug bounty program, research, PR, etc.\n\n\u003e how about we let this new proposal sit here and gather feedback for 1-2 months\n\nI support that. If it does upset Pi admins and they Abandon it, the discussion should continue elsewhere (like [issues](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues)).\n\nNote that if nobody develops and promotes this idea it will stall and gain a good reason to get abandoned.","signature":"7ac22e3298992602aa48fac0e55dea27235591acf83e1e95843d51529afba1535f34be8447ed06bb21561311a80e9e87a4fa669b395d15d1453dd038efa60a04","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"9","receipt":"da2b7de875b4702a1479bd3ffad04d5b492a65563520af3d5d2b0ed812181d2e9ff4838612bfa860de8467bc54c3f1f52dc786ade9b87b077e6f70864b3e8904","timestamp":1567342338,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

And by sharing ideas openly, maybe others will pickup on them if they truly do represent high-quality ideas.\n\nAlso, I said \"probably not me directly\" - but that doesn't mean I won't help out with leading on an indirect basis, thru inspiring, incubating, recruiting, structuring, etc.  That is my typical operating model in my life and in my businesses, which works well for me relative to my strengths, weaknesses,   and stage in life.  \n\n\u003eThe way I see incrementalism is we get something working first, and then build a better solution while having that something working for our benefit.
