Incrementalist Proposal as Small Step to Solving Decred's Liquidity Problem


**Problem:**  

Decred has a liquidity problem, which we believe originates from the fact that everyone within the community is staking to participate in governance with an incentive reward for doing so in the form of a staking yield.

**Solution:** 

Collectively, the Decred community desires to solve this problem, and agrees to offer a "standard MM incentive fee" to any MM who holds their Decred on an exchange and performs a MM function with:
* 3 BTC Buy Slippage, 
* 3 BTC Sell Slippage, 
* +/- 3% BBO,  
* average market spread of 0.5% for USDT and BTC pairs,
* 90% uptime,
* MM bears trading risks,
* MM coordinates its own loans and is responsible to negotiate a plan to bear risks of exchange hacks,

**Process:** 

* Announcing Participation: any MM can turn up and post their intention to perform the MM function for a given exchange and trading pair with a public announcement on Reddit or the Decred General thread on Matrix,
* First Come, First Serve:  a MM that announces intention to serve an exchange and trading pair must start-work within 24 hours and maintain uptime or else they lose the right to support the pair for a 30 day period,
* Record Keeping: records of orders placed and trading history must be maintained by MM,
* Audit & Spot-checks:  The Decred Community Overseer has right to audit records and perform random spot checks on MM records and order book,
* Errors:  “two strikes and you’re out (on all trading pairs)” policy with back-fees being due,
* Fraud:  "one strike and you're out (on all trading pairs)" policy with zero back-fees being due,
* Incentive:  in return for this valuable service, DCR Treasury will pay the staking yield forgone for the time period + trading fees for coins tied up in MM activities,
* Invoicing:  MM shall invoice Decred Community Overseer for services rendered on monthly basis,

**Decred MM Community Overseer:**

Initially, JZ or his designee shall perform an oversight function, checking records of each participating MM monthly, performing spot checks, and ensuring the staking yield and trading fees are properly paid out.  In return, JZ or his designee shall earn $2000 per month for overseeing the Decred MM program.  A new Decred MM Community Overseer shall be elected every 24 months.

**Observations:**

* If the existence of the "standard MM incentive fee" fails to achieve our community goal of liquidity and bringing multiple MMs into the DCR trading ecosystem, then we could potentially consider a 2nd proposal to increase the size of the “standard MM incentive fee”.  By ratcheting up the fee on an incrementalist basis, we can 'discover' the "sweet spot" where MMs are announcing participation and showing up to perform work, but still complaining that they are not being paid enough.
* Personally, I believe that offering staking yield forgone should be enough of an incentive to solve the problem, as earning the yield and maintaining liquidity as a DCR holder would be a much better position to be in, as opposed to having coins locked up for long periods of time.
