While I hear this first point, at same time, I wonder why MMs shouldn't take some risk and do some pre-work themselves, analogous to how coders might spec a solution and write some code to validate a concept prior to submitting on Pi? If 24 housr to \"announce \u0026 establish the liquidity target\" is sub-optimal, perhaps it could be extended to say, 48 hours, 5 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks?  Agreed, input from the MMs would be really helpful here.\n\n2. The proposal has been edited to include Unscrupulous Behavior alongside Fraud.

(betterfuture I assume?)\n\nWill vendors jump through the hoops?\n\nOversight/verification will be crucial: is it theoretically possible to determine after the fact that MM did a good job and did not cheat?\n\nWhat is the spending cap for this program? How to choose which players will fit and get paid and which will not?\n\nIs it fair to say this is a \"market maker bounty program\"?\n\nIncentives: we are hiring a market maker out of necessity. Most other coins do it, it did not happen (enough) by itself for DCR, so we _have_ to pay a MM now. I hope that at some point DCR markets will grow big enough that a Treasury-paid MM will be no longer necessary. However, if we run this program it might train a lot of players that Treasury is willing to fund this forever.\n\n**How I would proceed**\n\nRight now I think we need to move on with existing MM proposals, hold a vote and secure an MM for 6 months. A lot of effort was made to bring us this close to improving liquidity, that work and opportunity should not be wasted.\n\nDuring the oversight of the selected MM we will develop tools and ways that will be useful in context of this proposal as well.\n\nIn parallel with the selected MM doing his job, advance this \"MM market\" idea:\n\n- develop this idea further: collect more feedback (incl. from real MMs), refine processes\n- secure staff: find people who will do the oversight\n- secure pilot budget: submit a proposal to vote that requests a small budget to test this program (can reuse this proposal)\n- run the program for several months\n- report on the results\n- if the results are good, submit a second proposal with bigger budget\n\nIf any of the other MMs are hired now, by the time their first term ends this experiment should have some results already. If those look good, a follow up full blown proposal will be a good competition to the second term of the MM. Or it could even hire the existing MM via this new process.","signature":"8f5c5d2fad1c660d7e90101323ce6dc6e4f8a766a359598f9048a42e8059dbb735a53793306aa2d288d4d8dbb99730508145a1a969d10f6bdf521dfd8eaf2d00","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"6","receipt":"b6d4137ae5486c9ac9fe757b6a730d8b53979b869be3eac7d85bffa1ab9c3e5f57dffe66a66cb82f864f49652a4e3372048aa2953a77c4d3702b8f0abe5e5209","timestamp":1567292102,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
