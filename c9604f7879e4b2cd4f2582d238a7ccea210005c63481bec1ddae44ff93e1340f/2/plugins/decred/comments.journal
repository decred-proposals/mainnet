While I hear this first point, at same time, I wonder why MMs shouldn't take some risk and do some pre-work themselves, analogous to how coders might spec a solution and write some code to validate a concept prior to submitting on Pi? If 24 housr to \"announce \u0026 establish the liquidity target\" is sub-optimal, perhaps it could be extended to say, 48 hours, 5 days, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks?  Agreed, input from the MMs would be really helpful here.\n\n2. The proposal has been edited to include Unscrupulous Behavior alongside Fraud.  More input needed to define \"j, k, l behaviors\" in the body of the proposal.","signature":"bcbeb4ba656a1c16abdebfecf81cfa079e776479e9b1fe2071cc7cb5ff8e478b3156da702ee7e00d3dd64800bee853f50867de100907341df343a580dd573109","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"3","receipt":"94118afbe4292d7d744af7b4fdfdd5a7362631e3e98e182e9f3dcf2a11c7204be3d567c7860e172a3f8dff836394f200889a93327be34fb05a4cb4ca6ac26a0a","timestamp":1567266199,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
