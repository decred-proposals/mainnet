I have pointed this out earlier but did not get a response. So repeating the same. \n\nYour twitter account and other websites shows that you are the official and **active** brand ambassador for dash in Ghana. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/iamgeorgepro \n\n[Imgur Backup 1](https://i.imgur.com/SUUjIJy.jpg)\n\nhttps://dashafrica.org/team/ \n\n[Imgur Backup 2](https://i.imgur.com/KE0qBmn.jpg)\n\nI find that rather concerning and am unsure if you will be able to work without any conflict of interests.  \n\n\nSecondly regarding the marketing plan itself.\n\n\u003e We did a market research which shows that almost 70% of merchants would be willing to accept crypto (deCRED) only if they have enough information about how to use it and the legal aspect. Also, about 70% and 99% of the Ghanaian population has still not heard of Bitcoin and deCRED respectively.  \n\nCan we have some more details on how these numbers were calculated ? \n\n\u003e  This project will be undertaken by the deCRED Ghana team. A team of four core members with George pro as their leader.\n\nCan we have details on the other three core members ? \n\n\nI personally do not believe in any sort of \"marketing lead\" merchant adoption.\n\nI do like the idea of outreach to universities but id rather have it run though the existing \"Marketing\" or \"Events\" funding and approval process.","signature":"0296e22938a09bcd8e372006c711ee99d1fa7167a2062441fc99405ac7ce8ef64f1a128fff05bbbfcf26763bcdfdf2ba2c4858bed6d7755a3f3ab8b488683b0d","publickey":"d18e6dc2871b96d4e0966f3a5d95acc3c1024b7557b15d24597080e4daa68a66","commentid":"1","receipt":"22470dbc3f0b2dc191e007a4c4e106bfbfe0ac21a206f72ee275c1d6eb977ab8e7b203fffb3fbd7da15cf05cf4f72398c13fae15a50239d0777c337b201f5303","timestamp":1553098729,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

At a quick glance, these are my observation, starting from the good point:\n\n1. Motivation and its potential to decred ecosystem is sound.\n2. Some of the plans stated (especially those regarding the improvement of usability of decred as a currency) is good.\n\nUnfortunately however, the good stuff ends here, and the rest are my concern regarding this proposal, mostly regarding the execution part of the said plans. (also forgive me for being blunt)\n\n1. The pre-amble looks lazily copy and pasted and to me, it looks like very little effort(if any) is put into researching those numbers. Merely quoting a single source no matter how reputable the source is, is just not convincing enough. The blurry image attached also seems to be hastily downloaded from somewhere.(with no credit given to its source)\n2. The job scope seems a little overly ambitious for the time frame given. Given your past contributions which i've seen in slack (and I thank you for that), i also think that the budget asked is a little bit on the high side especially for a developing country which still has a relatively low cost of living. 16k for each region for each month will work out to 160k for 10 regions (if the final target is as you described) is a lot to ask for. The only concrete evidence that I observed so far were some very amateurishly put together casual meeting photos WITHOUT any video content at all. This has been asked many times because the most important is the actual content of delivery, but it seems like everytime this was brought up by the community members, you avoided the subject.\n3. The plans are not detailed enough, with some random target numbers being seemingly thrown around. (i.e: 10 universities, 10 regions, 10000 target audiences??). Mind to elaborate each of this region along with its universities in question? Otherwise, this only greatly reduces the credibility of your proposal.\n4. \"Constant social media marketing\": Do you have any existing proof of work being uploaded to any of the said social media? Any youtube videos? Given the extensive coverage already done by existing contributors (Ditto, Denni's tutorial video, decred digest, decred community website, official twitter/facebook, etc), how do you plan on further expanding this by creating an African specific channel? If am not wrong, English is still one of the main language being used in  Africa so the audience will have no problem looking for information in the already established sources. Creating your own social media channels seems redundant in this case.\n5. Above all, have you researched the hurdle that you have to go through by asking merchants to adopt decred as a cryptocurrency payment method? Is there any known (or potential future) cryptocurrency laws in Africa that might prevent this from being implemented smoothly? How confident are you in convincing them to 'embrace' decred?\n6. Referral system: You did not mention where do these referral rewards and 'winning prizes' comes from. Are they part of the budget?\n\nThese are my immediate concerns so far, i will add-on as and when i can think of a new ones. Thank you for your time to read and i hope that you will not take this the wrong way.","signature":"95b08b9ad1697c4b9bcd70c8323b952e93c61778d414af83cfbe949b60654c04e13acb9aafc68592bcd3646fba154286341a000b3ab9466b36f336bbe6d43f07","publickey":"88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1","commentid":"2","receipt":"2fd827c4159bc9be40c45414ffe74c7997522d829041665618fbc1599499eeaa1f1e58e33601f48cb0379fc5cafcfb830a5845d2f48a0cea0dde480e6bcb0809","timestamp":1553100348,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
