Also, about 70% and 99% of the Ghanaian population has still not heard of Bitcoin and deCRED respectively.  \n\nCan we have some more details on how these numbers were calculated ? \n\n\u003e  This project will be undertaken by the deCRED Ghana team. A team of four core members with George pro as their leader.\n\nCan we have details on the other three core members ? \n\n\nI personally do not believe in any sort of \"marketing lead\" merchant adoption.\n\nI do like the idea of outreach to universities but id rather have it run though the existing \"Marketing\" or \"Events\" funding and approval process.","signature":"0296e22938a09bcd8e372006c711ee99d1fa7167a2062441fc99405ac7ce8ef64f1a128fff05bbbfcf26763bcdfdf2ba2c4858bed6d7755a3f3ab8b488683b0d","publickey":"d18e6dc2871b96d4e0966f3a5d95acc3c1024b7557b15d24597080e4daa68a66","commentid":"1","receipt":"22470dbc3f0b2dc191e007a4c4e106bfbfe0ac21a206f72ee275c1d6eb977ab8e7b203fffb3fbd7da15cf05cf4f72398c13fae15a50239d0777c337b201f5303","timestamp":1553098729,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

At a quick glance, these are my observation, starting from the good point:\n\n1. Motivation and its potential to decred ecosystem is sound.\n2. Some of the plans stated (especially those regarding the improvement of usability of decred as a currency) is good.\n\nUnfortunately however, the good stuff ends here, and the rest are my concern regarding this proposal, mostly regarding the execution part of the said plans. (also forgive me for being blunt)\n\n1. The pre-amble looks lazily copy and pasted and to me, it looks like very little effort(if any) is put into researching those numbers. Merely quoting a single source no matter how reputable the source is, is just not convincing enough. The blurry image attached also seems to be hastily downloaded from somewhere.(with no credit given to its source)\n2. The job scope seems a little overly ambitious for the time frame given. Given your past contributions which i've seen in slack (and I thank you for that), i also think that the budget asked is a little bit on the high side especially for a developing country which still has a relatively low cost of living. 16k for each region for each month will work out to 160k for 10 regions (if the final target is as you described) is a lot to ask for. The only concrete evidence that I observed so far were some very amateurishly put together casual meeting photos WITHOUT any video content at all. This has been asked many times because the most important is the actual content of delivery, but it seems like everytime this was brought up by the community members, you avoided the subject.\n3. The plans are not detailed enough, with some random target numbers being seemingly thrown around. (i.e: 10 universities, 10 regions, 10000 target audiences??). Mind to elaborate each of this region along with its universities in question? Otherwise, this only greatly reduces the credibility of your proposal.\n4. \"Constant social media marketing\": Do you have any existing proof of work being uploaded to any of the said social media? Any youtube videos? Given the extensive coverage already done by existing contributors (Ditto, Denni's tutorial video, decred digest, decred community website, official twitter/facebook, etc), how do you plan on further expanding this by creating an African specific channel? If am not wrong, English is still one of the main language being used in  Africa so the audience will have no problem looking for information in the already established sources. Creating your own social media channels seems redundant in this case.\n5. Above all, have you researched the hurdle that you have to go through by asking merchants to adopt decred as a cryptocurrency payment method? Is there any known (or potential future) cryptocurrency laws in Africa that might prevent this from being implemented smoothly? How confident are you in convincing them to 'embrace' decred?\n6. Referral system: You did not mention where do these referral rewards and 'winning prizes' comes from. Are they part of the budget?\n\nThese are my immediate concerns so far, i will add-on as and when i can think of a new ones. Thank you for your time to read and i hope that you will not take this the wrong way.","signature":"95b08b9ad1697c4b9bcd70c8323b952e93c61778d414af83cfbe949b60654c04e13acb9aafc68592bcd3646fba154286341a000b3ab9466b36f336bbe6d43f07","publickey":"88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1","commentid":"2","receipt":"2fd827c4159bc9be40c45414ffe74c7997522d829041665618fbc1599499eeaa1f1e58e33601f48cb0379fc5cafcfb830a5845d2f48a0cea0dde480e6bcb0809","timestamp":1553100348,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We wanted the community to have an overview on how Africa is and the current state  of the continent. We copied but to say we lazily copied is somehow too strong to me. the image is quite clear over here it shocks us that  its a bit blurry after uploading. may be the quality was reduced after uploading it. All links concerning wherever we took some vital information from will be added to the proposal soon. we thought the community don't need them so we excluded most of them.\n2. concerning time frame its properly proportional to the work and the ambitions we want to achieved we shall add time-line and milestone to the proposal and all that ambiguity will be solved. Thanks for recognizing our work but if you say amateurish work i agree with you some of the events we organized pictures was taken by our phone which make the work somehow look amateur but a lot went into it during and after the organization. 1. getting proper venue 2. collaboration with other events organizers in some situation we paid money before we are allow to speak 3. there are some situations that we spoke under certain events that we did not post on any community platform at all because we realized the community will say we are doing amateur work, there are situations enquiry desk was set at events for participant to ask question concerning deCRED but we never share on slack the pictures look amateur after the events. Pictures of such events will be post soon. concerning budget sorry for the privacy of the sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8 check it here it will convinced you that the budget is not high and that it follows the plans and the things we budgeted for. \n4. In case of social media we are still working on dropping videos specifically for the African market. for instance how Africans see cryptocurrency is a bit different from  how the western world see it.In Africa we preach about being your own bank, ability to spend the credits everywhere, the fight is still  between fiat and cryptocurrency, full of peer to peer, using it to received remittances sometimes for export and import transactions therefore the marketing message we put across should be different even though the basics must be the same we shall therefore used existing  marketing materials and also add new ones that are tailored for the African market.\n5. concerning hurdles to be accepted as medium exchange i cannot say all barriers are removed in Ghana but its in the process let me drop some news links that justify that Ghana is one of the countries in Africa that is ready to make laws for cryptocurrency regulations https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Cryptocurrency-Advocates-push-for-swift-laws-by-BoG-686117#  \nhttps://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/BoG-assures-provision-of-regulations-to-support-blockchain-innovations-706509\nhttps://bitcoinafrica.io/2019/02/06/ghana-cryptocurrency-regulation-sec/\nhttps://www.africa.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-africa-slowly-picking-up-the-pace/\neven though there are no laws regulating it there are also no laws prohibiting it. even though it will be difficult convincing a number of them to accept it as medium exchange our main target its to provide them with the neccessary information and eduction so that when crypto is regularize they have no options that to choose deCRED. even then companies shops among others can choose to accept it as medium of exchange provided they have correct information and education. we have few shops down here that accept bitcoin. these are clarities i can make for now i will add more as time goes on.

First contributer i contacted since i started this activities for deCRED i appreciate your support and the guidance you have given me up to this level. Yes i can confidently say that i have worked with DASH as an ambassador before. That made me had a lot of experience when its comes to cryptocurrency ecosystem in Africa and Ghana to be precise. i have attend several conferences, radio talk show, events, meetups and had also organized some myself. Conflict of interest? i wiill say no, it started like, this is in early 2017 that i started doing cryptocurrency then i realized i really enjoyed using btc as compared to normal currency.(great advantage over fiat) because my father who was in Turkey was sending me remittances to my phone through btc which was easier, cheap and simpler as compared to western union. i started talking to people about btc and decided  to research more into it because i realize am lonely in this field and can also arguably changed the financial system in Ghana if much attention is pay to it. is through my research that i found DASH. Because i have learned a lot about cryptocurrency i was chosen by a Nigerian  DASH ambassador who submitted a proposal building a DASHYAfrica to work as an ambassador for Ghana.Through one blockchained conference somebody mentioned deCRED claiming he doesn't know the different between the two before then i have never head of deCRED. i research into the project then i realized this is where i belong since then i started preaching about deCRED.\nSecondly the research was than this way. we visited all exchanges both physical and online  we realized none of them ,has deCRED been listed. In Ghana telegram and whatsapp is also used as p2p platform of all the p2p platform we are in nobody  has mentioned of  selling deCRED before its always btc Dash and ethereum. To ten people gathered in Ghana 7 of them knew about bitcoin the remaining 3 have zero knowledge about btc this reseaerch was done through observing and asking questions and also through crypto and non crypto events i have attended. we then concluded that 70% of Ghanaians know btc in fact this is true since there are shops that accept btc in Ghana.\nconcerning why we included merchants we realized that one problem that could hinder businesses from accepting deCRED is lack of merchant that will directly buy the dcr and changed to fiat for them  without first converting to btc to avoid fees charged by exchanges like changelly and shapeshift since if that happen it could affect their initial capital due to high fees charged in converting dcr to btc. Merchants are included so that we can  build a complete ecosystem in Ghana where everybody benefits. \nThe other three core members are with their social media accounts are provided below:\n\n 1.Asare Okyer Baffour \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/asare-kyere-baffour-0a174617b\n\n2.

To 10 Ghanaians gathered  3 of them know about bitcoin and the remaining 7 has zero knowledge we therefore concluded that 70% of Ghanaians don't know about btc since to every 10 people is almost certain that only 3 know about btc.
