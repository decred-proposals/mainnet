Bring decred to Africa (Ghana) Adoption program for merchants and businesses
**Preamble**
   Africa is the most profitable region in the world. A report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development states that between 2006 and 2011, Africa had the highest rate of return on inflows of Foreign Direct Investment: 11.4%. This is compared to 9.1% in Asia, 8.9% in Latin America and the Caribbean. The global figure is 7.1%.Africa’s economic growth prospects are among the world’s brightest. Six of the world’s 12 fastest-growing countries are in Africa (Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Rwanda).Examples of companies benefiting from bountiful profits in Africa abound: Sonatrach’s turnover from oil and gas alone was $33.2 billion; MTN Group’s turnover was about $10 billion; and Dangote Group’s turnover was $4.1 billion—all in 2017. A variety of factors drive up Africa’s profit prospects, making it imperative for European, North American, Asian, and Latin American businesses to invest, helping to foster the continent’s economic progress. 
   For a market like Africa, where financial institutions are not easily accessible and many in the population are unbanked and underbanked, peer-to-peer finance gives them access to take control of their money the way they want, he added. It’s an opportunity for them to take control of their finances and be financially independent.

**Project Summary**
    With Ghana fiat currency (Cedis) suffering from Inflation  month after month and year after year due to government corruption and unfavorable regulations; citizens have continued to seek for alternative medium in which they can make payments as well as perform their daily trades with ease and less attention from the government.
Ghana as a nation for the past three years have conducted several researches on how to make the economy a cashless one. With most of its citizens being unbanked (70% of Ghanaian populace is unbanked) due to lack of trust in government controlled financial institutions, it is a great time for decred to appear to the scene and run to the rescue. The recent #endbankingfraud on twitter is typical and real evidence of how Africans are tired and have lost trust in the current financial system in Africa.
This proposal is focused on making decred the number one cryptocurrency for the Ghana populace through conducting conferences, seminars and workshops within and outside University campus, as well as having merchants accept decred as a medium of exchange so people don’t just keep decred  for purpose of gaining but to use it in their daily lives for purchasing goods and services which makes decred a true currency that is cryptocurrency with utility in Africa and not a buy low sell high cryptocurrency.
This project also seeks to setup a decred Physical exchange where people can trade the country’s fiat currency for decred and vice versa. This will enable easy purchase of the coin and enable newbies have their questions answered on a one-on-one base which would increase trust and confidence in decred.

**ROI/ BENEFITS OF THIS PROPOSAL TO decred **

1. We will help decred achieve its goal. That is, adoption and usability.
2. Adding over 1000plus well informed members to the decred Network through our outreach programs. Great people that will form great teams and contribute towards decred massive adoption.
3. Over 1000 decred wallets will be created & more than 20 merchants and businesses accepting decred as payments and listed on decredcommunity.com making it a “cryptocurrency with utility” rather than a “speculative asset”.
4. Increase the transaction volume of decred in Ghana through exchanges. If the users know decred get their first decred through our giveaways, buy decred through our local exchange platform (we currently speaking to ebitcoinics.com) start to use it and businesses progressively will start to use and accept it. We will manage an ecosystem of which allows a constant flow of capital which will benefit the quotation of decred.
5. Expand our outreach programs to other parts of the country and beyond, our target is to reach out to all universities in Ghana and also collect invaluable data on how young people adapt to decred and spread information about decred. We have observed that people show a lot of interest in crypto but don’t know which best option to start with. Decred provides a better option for everyone.

**decred Ghana vision and Strategy**

We are out to make decred  the mainstream cryptocurrency in Ghana, enhancing economic growth and improving living standards of its citizens through decred . We are committed to promoting the adoption and use of decred in Ghana
 
Our strategy is: Businesses, Merchant integration and extensive outreach. Our team will integrate decred  into major Blockchain/Cryptocurrency platforms and work towards massive adoption in Ghana 

**Awareness and Adoption**
Notwithstanding our best efforts to get decred to everyone in Ghana, the majority of Ghanaians are still unaware of decred and the cryptocurrency revolution that is taking speed throughout Africa. People of Africa need everything decentralized. Blockchain has the potential to give the public greater control over their data- and to help them earn money whenever their information is used. Many will therefore demand decred for their transactions as it solves numerous problems with their national currency, including portability, security, inflation, speed, privacy and receiving remittances. We did a market research which shows that almost 70% of merchants would be willing to accept crypto (decred) only if they have enough information about how to use it and the legal aspect. Also, about 70% and 99% of the Ghanaian population has still not heard of Bitcoin and decred respectively. We will teach them about these issues, and also train them adequately as merchant and Outreach Ambassadors across the country.

**OUR SOLUTION**
Getting merchants and businesses to accept decred is an arduous process in countries, however, providing them with the appropriate information through a professional and nearby institution that can provide them with support they need. The technical, financial, legal, accounting and tax advice to accept decred as a payment method in their businesses. With merchants ready to seek alternative payment solutions we believe we can convince a significant number of merchants and businesses to accept decred.  This will generate great press coverage about ways in which decred is being used as a utility rather than a “speculative asset”, further accelerating its adoption, and empowering them to gain financial freedom and financial sovereignty against excessive government control.

To achieve our goal of seeing decred becoming a cryptocurrency with utility and having a lot of use case in Africa with businesses, merchants and traders gradually embracing it as medium of exchange thus spreading the news about decred etc. There should be more cryptocurrency advocacy to cover as many people as possible. This means encouraging more wallets downloads and installations of decred functionality apps. Like most African nations, Ghana has a huge interest in cryptocurrency, with Google search data showing the country (Ghana is 3rd in the world, https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin), along with other African nations, regularly topping the list for Bitcoin enquiries. The more decred users there are and the better informed they are, the more pressure there will be on merchants to start accepting decred as a means of payment.

**WHAT WE PLAN TO DO**
In this project we shall be working around the clock to expand our outreach to more Universities/Colleges as well as businesses to provide to them reasons for them to embrace decred as means of payment. We want to create a simple and easy platform for hundreds of businesses in Ghana which will bring together operators of restaurants, hotels ,gas stations, estate agencies, travels and tours ,supermarkets, car rentals ,online shops among others to start accepting decred as a method of payment for goods and services. Also an intensive education on decred  how to set up decred wallets, how to accept decred as payment using designed printed decred POS in a form of printed decred QR codes and how decred can be of great benefit to their businesses.

We shall undertake the following activities:

•	Organize Monthly Regional Conference/Workshop in each region (Central Region, Ashanti and Greater Accra Region) to inform, educate and increase mass adoption campaign for decred in that jurisdiction through their educational institutions (Universities and Colleges). Our target is to reach out to 8 universities/Colleges, at least 2 from each region.

•	Organize Merchant/Business Adoption workshops in the selected three regions that would help recruit more Merchant, and get more businesses involved to accept decred as means of payment in their outlets using the designed printed decred POS in a form of printed decred QR codes 

•	Radio discussion about decred Cryptocurrency that would spread to people in the locality from principal media houses in the region. The radio program will be heard by about 45,000 people.

	We will also ask merchants/businesses to accomplish some requirements. If they complete the following list, we will give them a “training tip” of 10$ in decred:

* Put the “decred Accepted here” sticker in their business. 

* Post on their social media that they are accepting decred. 
* List their business in the decred merchant directory. 

**Referral Strategy:**
* Every merchant will win 10 points for each merchants they refer to us.
* When they get 50 points (5 referred merchants) they will win $15 worth decred.
* In this way we will reach more merchants with less effort.

**Plan B;**For bigger shops like Melcom Gh https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melcom , Accra Mall https://www.shoprite.com.gh/ , Marina Mall http://marinamallghana.com/ Kumasi City Mall http://kumasicitymall.com/ etc. who may still not be ready to accept decree as payment, we will create a merchant point near these shops where people can quickly exchange their decred to Fiat to purchase goods and services at these shops.
All these will create a platform for decred users to spend their decred at the nearest coffee shop, restaurant, hotel etc. The reason being that until a greater number of businesses begin to accept decred as a means of payment, people won’t start using their decred and decred owners will always see it as an investment. Several lessons and observations have been made since we started this project and there is the need to factor in merchants and business adoption to our mass educational campaign. 

**Plan C to create awareness and increase adoption**
The objective of the plan C stage, is to create a community around decred Ghana and Africa

**C.1** - Partnership with other organizations/Associations 
We will partner with organizations who share the same ideology with us and speak at their events. We will do presentations to their  audience
and members and have an inquiry desk at the event were people could come for more information. 
We at decred Ghana  is currently speaking to Ghana Association of Social Workers( GASOW) gasow.org.
Another association of focus is, Ghana industries (agighana.com). However we aim to go into negotiations with three more associations to have presentation about decred  at their events. They are: Humanist Association of Ghana (ghanahumanist.org), Small scale businesses Association of Ghana and National Union of Ghana students(nugsonline.gh.com)

**C.2** Create the decred Ghana page for the following social media.
* Facebook (decred and crypto news, 3-4 posts per week).
* Youtube (video tutorials, decred news, answer questions, 1-2 videos per 2 weeks).

Twitter (Everything decred)

**C.3** We will go to the top 5 universities in Ghana  and we will talk about decred  cryptocurrency, and the governance system, we will be offering shirts and stickers to attendees. Education-based marketing is probably the best effective method to advertise a new product. We shall therefore focused on bringing innovative ideas from undergraduate and postgraduate students in Ghanaian Universities based on their knowledge in marketing, technology, journalism, finance, accounting, communication etc. Our target is to organize workshops/conferences in all 6 selected Universities to educate and practically train students and lecturers  for adoption and usage of decred so for it to be a cryptocurrency with much usability with all the benefits and advantages of using decred against any other cryptocurrency. The workshops/conferences shall be open to all interested persons including CEOs of businesses, investors, the media (TV, Radio, online & print) and the general public at large

**C.4** Go to minor technology / fintech events to promote decred, offering shirts and stickers to attendees. We shall also attend non-crypto conference and speak about decred to their participants. To make decred a coin for the local people and the community we shall Collaborate with NGOs to project decred to generate mass awareness.
