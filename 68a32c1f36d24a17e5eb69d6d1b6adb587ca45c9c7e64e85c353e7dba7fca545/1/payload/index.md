DCR On-Chain Research: Phase 2

## Proposal Overview:

Deliver on-chain analytical tools via the following formats:

- Long-form analysis, which aims to help stakeholders develop a new perspective on the mechanics of the Decred economy
- Medium length analysis via "mini pubs" (mini publications), which will be used to provide new tools at a cheaper cost for the community
- A Decred On-Chain newsletter, to be delivered monthly or every month and a half, providing a concise overview of on-chain activity

## Phase 1 Overview:

### Contracting Takeaways:

- Much better understanding of what I can deliver per $ charged to the treasury (and where I can chop down costs)
- Stronger understanding of what work the community values more based on feedback from peers
- As a contractor, what work type of work I enjoy most
- Gaps in what I delivered in phase 1, and how that can be baked into phase 2 
- Average monthly spend over phase 1: ~$1,900

### Deliverable Takeaways:

- Generally speaking, longer articles were less popular - this feedback was taken into account after the first few deliverables to make reads more digestible
- Feedback was very positive for the [Decred On-Chain: Macro + Micro Outlook](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-macro-micro-outlook-12a26930623e) piece. Major takeaway is that there's appetite for charts, charts, and more charts on a more regular basis
- There's a big appetite from less technical folk to have Decred on-chain tools at their finger tips

These were the following deliverables over phase 1 for reference:

- [Decred On-Chain: A Look at Block Subsidies](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-a-look-at-block-subsidies-6f5180932c9b)
- [Decred On-Chain: The Ticket Pool VWAP](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-the-ticket-pool-vwap-d0a3d1c42a3)
- [Decred On-Chain: HODLer Conversion Rates](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-hodler-conversion-rates-87e16a4c78cd)
- [Decred On-Chain: Ticket Funding Rates](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-ticket-funding-rates-4e7233c7b64f)
- [Decred On-Chain: Macro + Micro Outlook](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-macro-micro-outlook-12a26930623e)
- [Decred On-Chain: Strongest Hand Market Cap + Ratio](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-strongest-hand-market-cap-ratio-146d6854e1d6)
- [Decred On-Chain: Analyzing the Pulse of Miners](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain/blob/master/RESEARCH/BLK_TIMES.md)

The combination of Contracting & Deliverable takeaways have been baked into the proposal specifics below.

## Deliverables for Phase 2:

**Potential Research Topics:**

- Cross-chain analysis, which will help users understand DCRBTC market cycles / patterns over time (in my opinion this is an incredibly underexplored area in the crypto space)
- Cross-stakeholder analysis, which will helps users understand how different forces within the Decred ecosystem impact each other / move together
- Possibly building an economic index which shows the health of the Decred economy with a single score (have early ideas on this, need to explore further to check feasibility)
- More time analyzing mining data (block rewards, fees, hashrate, difficulty, block times), as phase 1 was very heavy on the ticket data analysis
- Exploration of storage metrics (blockchain size, as an example)
- Decred's first on-chain capitulation: a historical recap

- As always, tools and analysis will have the end goal of giving the community the best information possible on the current state of the Decred economy
- As was the case in phase 1, addressable topics will likely expand as the analysis starts fleshing out

**Long-form Analysis:**

- These will be a similar format to written pieces in phase 1
- In depth analysis of the Decred chain, only to be written when a big insight is discovered that merits a longer-form explanation
- These tend to be more expensive due to the additional / natural demands that come from longer-form analysis

**Medium-length Analysis:**

These will be a series of "mini-pubs" which provide the following:
- Chart(s)
- Summary of tool / rationale behind the tool
- Concise analysis of chart(s) within the publication
- Calculation for tool
- Link to code on Github that fetches data and calculates the metric 
- A copy of the publication will be present in Github as part of an ongoing library of Decred on-chain tools

- This type of analysis will provide a better bang-for-buck for the community as it eliminates the extra time needed for longer-form pieces

**Short-form Analysis:**

- On-chain newsletter to be delivered monthly / every couple months (similar format to [Decred On-Chain: Macro + Micro Outlook](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-macro-micro-outlook-12a26930623e))
- Cheapest form of analysis by providing an overview of the current state on already existing tools
- These sometimes may include a "mini-pub" within 
- In my opinion, this will be a strong complement to the Decred Journal, Decred Drive, and Politeia Digest publications

**Additional Notes:**

- I've recently started automating all my on-chain tools and have even started doing this for other chains as well (which will be useful in cross-chain research)
- I expect it to take another month or two to get fully comfortable with charting / merging data / eliminating redundancies in my code
- Some of my early work on this is [here](https://github.com/permabullnino/nino_on_chain) (note that I'm still a beginner so keep the chuckles to yourselves :))

With this in mind, each tool will come with code that performs the following functions:
- Calculates the metric
- Prints the values in their programming terminal
- Prints a basic chart of the tool
- Sends values to an excel document for those that want to explore the data there

## Budget:

- **Total Requested Budget:** $16,000
- **Expected Time for Completion:** 8-10 months (May - January)
- **Projected Monthly Spend:** $1,600 - $2,000

- **Long-form Analysis:** $1,000 - $2,000 per publication
- **Medium-length Analysis:** $300 - $1,000 per publication
- **Short-form Analysis:** $100 - $300 per publication 

**Notes:**
- No work from coding will be charged towards this budget, but will consume a chunk of my time in the first month or two as I get up to speed
- It's difficult to determine which bucket of analysis will consume majority of budget, but my hunch is the medium-length analysis likely will

## Final Point

I look forward to engaging with the community on this proposal, and happy to take any constructive feedback on previous work / future work proposed within. The proposal was designed to provide as much analysis as possible per dollar spent by cutting down a bit on the length of research publications, but can be tweaked if this isn't something of interest to stakeholders.
