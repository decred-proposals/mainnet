Enhanced utility will drive appreciation and push Decred to the front of the stage in this ecosystem.. \n\nOn-Chain fundamental analysis, speculation and even analytics are helpful to gain insight into the project but current participants in DCR  passively observe from the sidelines and I only worry that the more time and DCR we invest as whole into massaging data to demonstrate value vs. rolling up sleeves, innovating and pushing commits and revolutionary tech will delay Decred's public awareness. \n\nFurther and ongoing analysis on a Balance Sheet of a company would be filed under R \u0026 D in my opinion and I would like to catalyze more innovation to onboard more community members.. I personally feel R \u0026 D investments should have a positive return and if we're measuring ROI in terms of DCR appreciation - $, SATS, or additional users/participants - I am struggling to see the return the project needs w/ regard to additional on-chain vs. Genuine Innovation (DEX, LN integration, Schnorr, Privacy CoinShuffle ++ ) \n\nThank you again for all your contributions \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"8f307b1f4a7535271f06f91d38e77d272c7f9052e73bc3e9e657b54a2f29cc0e429068121216b45798a98a64357b677402d11eceda721d864539b3273e1b750a","publickey":"25d26d36a21aa470f6ed2ea1d347d9f0376cb6ed9582d664a0943091a433d776","commentid":"1","receipt":"920d8f1357bf6a034957b59567edf3e3f44a92460c294aeb417efb880c4257e35254126b4e30415ac875e1e39613bee3976cfe7dde99b2031f210730dbb4f000","timestamp":1589408362,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I believe very few projects understand their chain performance as well as Nino, and by proxy Decred's stakeholders and this will have lasting influence.\n\nAt its core, the analysis Nino has performed provides three key parties with invaluable information which I believe benefits the project both today and into the future:\n- Stakeholders - by providing clear distilled information, governance can be as best informed as possible (this also includes miners and I very much welcome further research into this market)\n- Long term investors (both retail and institutional) - providing detailed fundamental analysis as expressed through actual performance\n- Short term traders - providing actionable trading signals which once live on a website (proposal coming soon) will hopefully can be a draw for additional liquidity\n\nI look forward to the outcome of this proposal and am supportive of the works proposed.","signature":"574ffcfb20028582caa52c0f3dcb19424b858648f092aafa95011b0f2322100e6235280e683eb113b408f975c882fef3f7a4999bfdff6dfbb94249b84e832804","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"2","receipt":"107b1df4e8b2ec02e703334b8a6ddba89bedd0158e216589134ff15b51c0a823b62778c700cedc95366d2fd521f9dfb172127870a14c4a4520b8231e6ab9ae02","timestamp":1589431307,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here's my two cents that might help alleviate some of your concerns with the proposal:\n\n- When I talk about research on DCR capitulation, I'm talking about the on-chain footprint that's been scattered across the various stakeholder groups, not an analysis of the DCR/BTC chart. Decred has never gone a full market cycle before so this information would (in my opinion) be extremely valuable for stakeholders, and will likely come with tools that can used again in the future\n\n- The economic index was just an idea, and would be some sort of composite score across various DCR on-chain tools. Given the nature of the tool, wouldn't be expensive *if* it was done (and it actually worked of course). If people don't like this idea, happy to scrap it , not something I'm married to by any means\n\n- I agree that dev work and funding it is of utmost importance for Decred. However, there is value in funding other work to complement theirs - no team has ever won a championship without contributions from role players, and my goal with this proposal is to continue in a supporting role\n\nNow for a few nerdy accounting takes on the proposed / previous work:\n\n- These publications / research are not \"expenses\", they're assets. What comes from the research can be used by stakeholders all across the board for the forseeable future (and in a variety of ways), and the cumulative value that comes from that would be how I'd measure ROI personally. Expecting on-chain research to pump price is a tall task unfortunately. So the fairer question would be: does the cumulative value over the months / years from these tools surpass the $16k spent through 2020? If the answer in your eyes is still no, then I certainly consider it fair to vote against the proposal.\n\n- When I worked in audit, we had a saying that went \"if you didn't document it, it didn't happen\". I view my job as an on-chain analyst as a role in documentation, and by doing so providing not only (1) greater visibility to those outside the project, but (2) further assurance on what's going on within the Decred economy.\n\n- Last point: I know funding Decred research is valuable because I am a customer of it from day 1. Richard Red's extensive write ups helped bolster my understanding and hook me in during my early Decred days (along with Zubair Zia's work). I'm sure I'm not the only one with this story","signature":"b469945dc794194523830e7d26bbd599586818258a5e47e2c1c5d2b33fe9f30d4d1e3ceb1adc119e8296d1ef9c2539e5979c34e23d41344b79f6878f59c04909","publickey":"8f9fa531b543c6e0b805a1abcc858400f8316cd937785c40e36f4d05171e83b5","commentid":"5","receipt":"4e2d1d7879804a20a62f494ea93eaa62b099256f2f0cfbdca9466f14871c39ca7709cf207705ec112208e6de3cd4d95d9a11d8a5625a0e87c318989a65ae2e06","timestamp":1589471438,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Indicators of when % tickets staked = likelihood of price appreciation..? I guess I just don't understand why funds from the treasury have to continue to be invested to verify Higher Stake % = Higher Value of DCR network.. \n\n\u003e \"Economic` Index\" - a composite score ? .. again, I am struggling to see the utility to the network/community in having a potential tool \"that might or might not work\" that DCR community members have to contribute funds toward supporting ?\n\nSomething we agree on - ***\"I agree that dev work and funding it is of utmost importance for Decred.\"  ***\n\nYou argue there is value in funding other work that is **complimentary** - can you quantify the value your research has yielded? \nHow are your publications driving user adoption, awareness, and interaction.. you have 2400+ followers on TWTR; how can your publications reach 10,000 - 100,000 (are you tweeting the publications to prominent figures) ?\n\nYou maintain the stance - your research is filed as an ASSET. How do we quantify that ? \nValue to stakeholders is too vague \u0026 qualitative.. as ticket-holders and community participants, we deserve to see ROI on roughly - 1150 DCR or $16,000.. what is it ?\n\nI don't expect on-chain publications (IF THE AUTHOR'S PLATFORM is limited to 2.4K followers on TWTR) to pump price ..\n\nHow do we get Permabull Nino or _Checkmate_ to share on chain fundamentals w/ @POMP or Andreas or Coinbase CEO - Brian Armstrong, or Jesse Powell - Kraken CEO or Jack Dorsey ?\n\nDecred Project is a few business quarters away from Innovative Explosion and 1150 DCR/$USD could be VERY valuable to the community and Treasury for future ventures.\nWhile it's $16,000 currently - it could be $100,000+ in near future if the intrinsic value of this network reaches mainstream.. \n\nAll I'm asking and imploring the community to ask - WHAT IS THE QUANTITATIVE ROI on further On-Chain metric research papers if the publications continue to fly under the radar or don't reach the audience that needs to access this data ? If ur a stakeholder through this brutal bear market/SAT/$USD - you have a rough understanding of Stake Pool metrics.. how do we reach the rest of the World ?\n\nAppreciate Everyone's contributions and efforts and welcome constructive feedback, \n\nThank you \n\n\n\n\n","signature":"fc3e08e0362218020451dbf6544f2c175de58613502629e259ce42ea352af4d0018ab592807a70645dd7a46d55bbb9cfa18c5704df7bf9d81436d4b91107b105","publickey":"25d26d36a21aa470f6ed2ea1d347d9f0376cb6ed9582d664a0943091a433d776","commentid":"7","receipt":"55067f279ee2a204faa4a1c97b7191791e40ef0f20dd28716bce79b2ee1d0fb9bcf4ccfa3cb2bf80fa20e1ded15381a01c548230c81de85e1595b6562409f10a","timestamp":1589498327,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The three parties I noted include current AND future stakeholders. Many people, both retail, institutions and traders will be looking at this space as it gains increasing momentum. We are all here because we believe this technology and in particular Decred stand to benefit the world in almost immeasurable ways. Providing clear, concise and well considered research will attract attention as we leave the bear. The alternative is you have a bunch of ill informed or automated hype machines with no substance. I am not well versed in that approach so can't speak to how it would perform or be actioned.\n\nTraders who can find edge will take it. The more crystal clear and obvious the edge is (i.e. a signal with fundamental basis and high success rate), the more traders will arbitrage it. The more arbitrage the more volume. More volume is more liquidity.  This is the pathway being targeted. Of course nothing is guaranteed, however I see this as a viable path.\n\nYou cannot add ASICs and hash without price to support it. This will happen with time,  but arbitrarily adding additional rigs without price appreciation is a sunk cost and is guaranteed to lead to more sell pressure. Hash follows price, not the other way around.\n\nSound research and education is what brings long term Decred holders in and importantly, keeps them here. Provide them with a sound understanding of the chain which also helps direct good governance decisions. Be informed with the tools available. Nino and I are working with a team to bring many of these metrics and charts live to a website soon and this will further add tangible benefit to the project.","signature":"19a75ce38453d6b5276d7b3f4db9813196edcc243dd094a1445b0f4175fb77a8ff035d8b3e7527b2f34f4904b6c111d6ea63e3dcf81fe2d8c5ecaff721fa4400","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"8","receipt":"6165424ad38eb2f25cee61c754c765a271cd44d8e7131747b071fffd2c955eab26db67b0fb049109cc84858bd9b95d07e68e627f9a9445f1cb6d66db52a27107","timestamp":1589519871,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Hopefully concerns on that front are cleared up with [Checkmate's most recent proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/023091831f6434f743f3a317aacf8c73a123b30d758db854a2f294c0b3341bcc) to bring an on-chain landing page to Decred.\n\n- Outside of Bitcoin, there are few (if any) projects that have coherent on-chain data the way Decred does. As newly emerging monies, I believe on-chain data analysis is not only valuable for trading (what it's usually associated with), but also in studying how stakeholders engage with their money, which (as Checkmate has mentioned) can better inform governance decisions in the future. \n\n- Agree with me or not, there's value in proving how elegant the on-chain data prints are for Decred. As somebody who spends a lot of time looking at this stuff, it is a strong way to separate the real cryptocurrencies and the pretenders. We might be on the early side of this, but smart people do and will find value in the work that's been completed to date.\n\n- Decred still hasn't left the bear market behind, so naturally everyone is a bit concerned about treasury spends (totally understandable). But this is why I designed the proposal as it is, and especially the portion focused on the medium-length deliverables - I want to churn out analysis at the most cost efficient way possible for the treasury. Tools that stakeholders will be able to use for a long time, and will hopefully aid them in better understanding the unique economy they've opted into.\n\n- Overall, maybe your mind is already made up anyways, but figured this might at a minimum give you greater comfort in the ask I have proposed to the community","signature":"f852d3c4ee25bbd520f9d9d628de5a2c954f464fa1168462c88e78e32c98ebffc5458ae4bd43b6102d622dd4bf1892f3b68bc06bb1fa5f8de134bc8b82136701","publickey":"8f9fa531b543c6e0b805a1abcc858400f8316cd937785c40e36f4d05171e83b5","commentid":"13","receipt":"b0567e2a72d92dd5617fbd10682eda04f8e1343427c820ae9aa5c4fd5b5b8a6e2f15f05e4c59859c925185d5fbf565227b57098376f4232af31656e25337b009","timestamp":1589860026,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
