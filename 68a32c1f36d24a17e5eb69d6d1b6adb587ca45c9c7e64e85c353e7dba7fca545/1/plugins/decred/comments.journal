Enhanced utility will drive appreciation and push Decred to the front of the stage in this ecosystem.. \n\nOn-Chain fundamental analysis, speculation and even analytics are helpful to gain insight into the project but current participants in DCR  passively observe from the sidelines and I only worry that the more time and DCR we invest as whole into massaging data to demonstrate value vs. rolling up sleeves, innovating and pushing commits and revolutionary tech will delay Decred's public awareness. \n\nFurther and ongoing analysis on a Balance Sheet of a company would be filed under R \u0026 D in my opinion and I would like to catalyze more innovation to onboard more community members.. I personally feel R \u0026 D investments should have a positive return and if we're measuring ROI in terms of DCR appreciation - $, SATS, or additional users/participants - I am struggling to see the return the project needs w/ regard to additional on-chain vs. Genuine Innovation (DEX, LN integration, Schnorr, Privacy CoinShuffle ++ ) \n\nThank you again for all your contributions \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"8f307b1f4a7535271f06f91d38e77d272c7f9052e73bc3e9e657b54a2f29cc0e429068121216b45798a98a64357b677402d11eceda721d864539b3273e1b750a","publickey":"25d26d36a21aa470f6ed2ea1d347d9f0376cb6ed9582d664a0943091a433d776","commentid":"1","receipt":"920d8f1357bf6a034957b59567edf3e3f44a92460c294aeb417efb880c4257e35254126b4e30415ac875e1e39613bee3976cfe7dde99b2031f210730dbb4f000","timestamp":1589408362,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
