Enhanced utility will drive appreciation and push Decred to the front of the stage in this ecosystem.. \n\nOn-Chain fundamental analysis, speculation and even analytics are helpful to gain insight into the project but current participants in DCR  passively observe from the sidelines and I only worry that the more time and DCR we invest as whole into massaging data to demonstrate value vs. rolling up sleeves, innovating and pushing commits and revolutionary tech will delay Decred's public awareness. \n\nFurther and ongoing analysis on a Balance Sheet of a company would be filed under R \u0026 D in my opinion and I would like to catalyze more innovation to onboard more community members.. I personally feel R \u0026 D investments should have a positive return and if we're measuring ROI in terms of DCR appreciation - $, SATS, or additional users/participants - I am struggling to see the return the project needs w/ regard to additional on-chain vs. Genuine Innovation (DEX, LN integration, Schnorr, Privacy CoinShuffle ++ ) \n\nThank you again for all your contributions \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"8f307b1f4a7535271f06f91d38e77d272c7f9052e73bc3e9e657b54a2f29cc0e429068121216b45798a98a64357b677402d11eceda721d864539b3273e1b750a","publickey":"25d26d36a21aa470f6ed2ea1d347d9f0376cb6ed9582d664a0943091a433d776","commentid":"1","receipt":"920d8f1357bf6a034957b59567edf3e3f44a92460c294aeb417efb880c4257e35254126b4e30415ac875e1e39613bee3976cfe7dde99b2031f210730dbb4f000","timestamp":1589408362,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Thinking outside the box is an understatement and I am supportive of his continued work. The scope of works is concise, tangibly beneficial and industry leading in my opinion. I believe very few projects understand their chain performance as well as Nino, and by proxy Decred's stakeholders and this will have lasting influence.\n\nAt its core, the analysis Nino has performed provides three key parties with invaluable information which I believe benefits the project both today and into the future:\n- Stakeholders - by providing clear distilled information, governance can be as best informed as possible (this also includes miners and I very much welcome further research into this market)\n- Long term investors (both retail and institutional) - providing detailed fundamental analysis as expressed through actual performance\n- Short term traders - providing actionable trading signals which once live on a website (proposal coming soon) will hopefully can be a draw for additional liquidity\n\nI look forward to the outcome of this proposal and am supportive of the works proposed.","signature":"574ffcfb20028582caa52c0f3dcb19424b858648f092aafa95011b0f2322100e6235280e683eb113b408f975c882fef3f7a4999bfdff6dfbb94249b84e832804","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"2","receipt":"107b1df4e8b2ec02e703334b8a6ddba89bedd0158e216589134ff15b51c0a823b62778c700cedc95366d2fd521f9dfb172127870a14c4a4520b8231e6ab9ae02","timestamp":1589431307,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
