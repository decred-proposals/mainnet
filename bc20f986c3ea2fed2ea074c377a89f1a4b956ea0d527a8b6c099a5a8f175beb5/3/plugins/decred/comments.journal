My initial reaction to this was: wow, quite bold to ask 2x more for one single country than the entire LATAM Proposal asked for, and almost 3x more than the entire European Proposal. Also, considering the latter got rejected at $50k (for the entire continent of Europe, and also included established members like karamble, haon), as a stakeholder I expect extraordinary evidence for why such a sum is justified.\n\nFor perspective, you ask for $125k for events in a single country, while the DEX, one of the most daring and infrastructurally central projects for the whole DCR ecosystem asked for between $100k and $250k.  Something seems off in this picture.\n\nIn the **Why?** section you list things that you believe set your community apart from the others, but what I would expect is something different: I would expect you to talk more about what justifies this sum for 2020. How old the community is, whether it was there before coin’s launch or not, shouldn’t be a reason to ask for a vastly larger sum.  The money Proposal submitters get on Pi shouldn’t be some kind of “loyalty reward” for being with the project for a long time.  I know you were promoting DCR from the earliest days, it goes way back to bitcointalk etc.  Still, that should play only a minor role, if any at all.   \n\nStatements about what the Proposal submitter *believes* to be the case are insufficient and require supporting evidence:\n\n\u003eI currently believe that we are only behind the USA in number of active members.\n\nWhat is this “current belief” based on, specifically?  Not necessarily denying this, but it would need an explanation: is it based on the metrics of some specific platform like Facebook?  Do you believe that to be an appropriate metric to gauge the sizes of the communities?\n\n\u003eWe’ve already had cases where the Decred website had more accesses from Brazil than from the USA.\n\nIs this anecdotal, from your memory, or is there a metric for this available somewhere?  Is the metric 'Sybil resistant'?\n\n\u003ethe BR community had around 5,000 members. Today, at the height of alt winter, we have around 6,000. We grew 20% while most other altcoins communities lost several members.\n\nIf the BR community is so vibrant and active, why do the YouTube videos have 20, 30, 40 views …? This is very low [Link to channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DecredBrasilOficial/)\n\n\u003eDuring the years 2016 and 2017 I paid for events and marketing campaigns for DCR in Brazil and also in other countries including the Middle East with my own money and in some cases with the help of other Brazilian members\n\nThat is wonderful and deserving of respect, however, it shouldn’t directly impact people’s decision regarding the adequacy of this proposal and its ask.\n\n\u003e $11,000.00 for sponsor and participation in around 8 big events, organization of around 13 meetups and small events.\n\u003e$22,000.00 for transport, accommodation and food expenses.\n\u003e$79,000.00 for expenses with hours worked by more than 18 members.\n\nCould you go into a little more detail about what this $80k of labour entails? Can you break it down a little?\nWe should also remember that the cost of living and average pay in Brazil is drastically lower than in Europe. When we consider this fact, doesn’t asking for 3x more than the European Proposal require more elaboration?\n\n---\n\nWith the outbreak of the Corona Virus, people are avoiding large public events. Many wealthy major corporations have publicly canceled their own events. Why should Decred Stakeholders finance costly Brazil meetups, can we count on these events producing tangible results regardless of a possible global pandemic?\n\n---\n\nAs someone who’s been with the project for a long time, you have witnessed how DCR struggled price-wise vs BTC in the last 2 years, don’t you think we should try to be austere in our spending, to avoid adding unnecessary sell pressure?\n\nIn any case, I look forward to your responses, and updates to the Proposal.

I was thinking you were taking too long to show up :D\n\nIf you pay attention, you will see that LATAM's proposal is for 6 months, totaling approximately a total of 144k per year.\nThe BR proposal involves expenses already in March, such as Campus Party Amazonia, therefore 10 months and with a maximum projection of 125k per year. \n\nAs it is written, Brazil has almost the same population of all other Latin American countries together, around 40%. Also almost the same area as all the others together. In addition, between Brazilian states there are great cultural and ethnic differences that don't exist or are very few between the Hispanic countries. For example, the state of Bahia is practically an African country within Brazil. The Amazon, an indigenous descendants country, more Japaneses lives in Sao Paulo than anywhere else in the world. Santa Catarina looks like a little Germany. Parana is known as \"Brazilian Russia\" and several other examples. Only those who have been here and got to know from north to south understand the differences. We are a lot of countries within a single country. \n\nRegarding the European proposal, imho, it's fail on some points. There is a lack of better detail to the requested amount that besides other things is insufficient even to pay the contractors working hours, so I believe it was not approved but I am sure that if it is redone more carefully, it will be successful.\n\nComparing marketing and events with DEX or another feature to be developed does not make any sense.\nBoth are important and totally different things.\n\nEach has its peculiarities in relation to cost. Development we are talking about hours worked and that deserve to be paid well.\nMarketing and events involve much more things and services from third parties. Air tickets, hotel, food, purchase of gifts, banners, assembly of booths, etc.\n\nAs an example, a place at Campus Party Sao Paulo costs from $ 50,000 to $ 400,000. We got it for free.\n\nThe DEX will be amazing, but decred is already an amazing currency.\nWhat is missing? Marketing. And this is not the time to reduce costs with this.\n\nGood marketing is what we do in Brazil and now we see Elian's team doing for Hispanic countries in Latin America as well.\nI don't see a reason why BR deserves a smaller budget than the rest of LATAM if it involves practically the same number of people in 26 states that are totally different from each other.\n\nYou approach Brazil in a prejudiced manner, saying that Europe's contractors should receive more, because here people are poorer and things cheaper. I don't condemn you because I consider the international and also the internal medias guilty of defending foreign interests in making us appear poorer and more savage than we are.\n\nAny promotional film or documentary about Brazil only shows poverty. I think Paris must have more homeless people than any Brazilian city that I know. I have seen images of bagda at war saying it was in BR.\n\nTake a look at the photos I put up of the meetups and you will see some Brazilian cities as they are. Of course, there is poverty here, but everywhere there is, the difference is that other countries hide it.\n\nAs written in the text, we have 7 devs of decred who are Brazilian, apart from the USA which other country has the same number?\nI don't think they should receive less just because they are Brazilian.\n\nYes, there are cheaper basic things here. Probably for a poor person it makes a difference, but for those who are middle class it is the opposite. A car that costs $70,000 in the USA, costs $180,000 in Brazil.\n\nFor reasons of privacy and security, an agreement was reached that it should not be disclosed how much each contractor receives, but I can assure you that my hours worked are the cheapest of the entire team, and by my choice. I dedicate much more hours a day to decred than I receive. But this is a personal decision of mine, you cannot reach a worker and say: \"you will receive less than him because you are a Latin American.\" Please ...\nTo be continued ...\n\nP.s. Sorry for delay, but you know that my English is terrible. I need to write and rewrite several times and our conversation is long.\n","signature":"effd95895eed0e4dcdfaecddbe00bf62ab4d646352ac26b90164e1b1ac7a7fcbe353c8580c730eafd4de8c0898e166ae6a2741011ad3c4d8c509af8101420603","publickey":"c1cd38140c03bf6c34130ae6f89e592fb13ecad9b83aa660ffd8a74da4655d38","commentid":"2","receipt":"cf5dfcbe93d2b89b38c1fc887ea4e560f9c025f43ba0ca74a16c0b2ff2c18e6ecb157f63c64f3d870a8127cbe5ab4ec044363417c85d3d160c7c8fdbcc21d70c","timestamp":1583541200,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The group is closed, so it's possible to know how many people have accessed it and the posts that have been viewed. Recalling that although it does not appear, there is a private messenger where several discussions take place in different rooms, with different people in the group.\n\nAbout youtube, it only counts people who are logged on youtube or some google service like gmail or others in the background.\n\nI honestly think that covid19 is not as dangerous as they are making you believe it is. Nothing has been canceled in Brazil so far and no one has died. If the events are canceled or we consider that the cost does not pay to participate because the reduction in the public, it's obvious that we will not go and the money will not be spent.\n\nThat amount is a ceiling for us to use with marketing. It doesn't mean that we will spend everything. \n\nAnyone who knows me knows that I do my best to save the most money from the treasury.\n\nYou should know this, because even after 2017 I approached you asking for the indication of journalists from cointelegraph and coindesk to pay with money from the BR community for publications and articles. I've always been behind publicity for decred inside and outside Brazil.\n\nAs stated in the proposal, this year of 2020, we have already held 5 meetups with money from me and other BRs.\n\nI agree that the treasure must be spent carefully and rationally. However, at this point, marketing is fundamental. \n\nDecred needs to stop being a underdog and take the place it deserves in the mainstream. And for it to happen, DCR needs to appear. \n\nWhen that happens we can think about stopping spending on marketing.

I'm not manipulated by media and I'm not basing anything on any opinion. I'm basing it on facts. Brazil is objectively cheaper than, say, California. So organizing an event in Brazil must be cheaper. It's not my opinion and it has nothing to do with what the media shows about Brasil, it's just a fact that should be taken into account when we evaluate how much money should be spent for creating events in that part of the world.\n\nIn a general context you are right to say that organizing an event in BR is cheaper than in Europe and that is why we can participate in a larger number.\n\nBut this is relative. I cite Campus Party São Paulo again, which costs from $50,000 to $400,000. Around the same price as the Web Summit in Europe.\n\nBut we always got a good place in it for free with several lectures on the main stages.\nWe have already had 8 lectures in a single conference.\n\nCampus Party is a a great event in the chosen cities during the year. Being the only altcoin present alongside bitcoin in the blockchain arena is very relevant. Sometimes ETH, Dash and Zcash also participate, but because they have to pay the true cost, they are infrequent.\n\nIn my opinion, we cannot pass up this opportunity for now, even if it requires a good investment in logistics and hours worked.\nThe same goes for Bitconf and the Cointelegraph/Criptofacil Summit\n\nYour questions were very relevant and helped me to clarify somethings, Praxis. Thank you.\n\n","signature":"4c5dd36a7399f3321eef13e2a458c1653b303d282749262df5e4ae1931e8aae9d935009824d750a368cbf6ade2751e34c341d5c39a23a443e2c344a6bfe53409","publickey":"c1cd38140c03bf6c34130ae6f89e592fb13ecad9b83aa660ffd8a74da4655d38","commentid":"10","receipt":"1553001a2d7e5cad5f9792562e9ed42111f589ef375d2166a64e4cfef8f7966871baef797e8db1cd6f43e8452fb8cd21b4ecc74744434db47ca953cf5319a801","timestamp":1583612771,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I understand emilio been doing impressive works and contributing selflessly to the project. \n\n- The amount asked for is a lot, considering its for 18 members it may be justifiable. \n- Looking at covid-19 spreading and still growing, there is a good chance big events may not achieve good results. Could some events be shifted to online / more localized /smaller scale? \n- I seen discussion about population of Br is more - this may or may not justify higher cost to be allocated. Perhaps we can also look at purchasing power / GDP per population? ( i dont like seeing china/india proposal asking for gigantic amount and justify it with population/land area. \n- I feel this is a big plan and maybe it should be scaled down and making it 6 mths to make it more consumable before growing it to full scale. \n- At current DCR prices this or any marketing/community plans will eat up treasury significantly. I also agree it is important so we need to spend carefully. \n\nAnother of my concern is unbalance distribution of treasury funds, when the EU proposal just been rejected and a large amount is allocated to Br/Latam, will this go to a cycle where more users in Latam/Br buy DCR and vote positively on props for their own geolocation, eventually skew the project to one side of the world, making it a one country/region project ? I imagine if every country has only X% of population would be willing to own CC (because CC is not for everyone), having large amount of fund on one region and minimum funds on other region is not the most effective way of growing the project. Does this concern you emillio ? What is your view to grow the project in a balance manner. \n\nWould love to see more discussion to help me make up my mind on this vote. Good Luck !

Two cases of internal contamination. Contaminated Brazilians have mild symptoms.\n\nThe common flu kills around 650,000 people a year worldwide. \nProportionally a much larger number than has been attributed to covid19.\nThe H1N1 virus is much more aggressive than the corolla and in its epidemic there was not as much despair as it is now.\n\nI really don't know how things are going in other countries because I don't believe in the press and the images it shows, especially in times of world crisis when the owners of the world need to find a \"culprit\" for it.\n\nOf course, the illness exists and has spread around the world, what I question is the real severity of the symptoms and the percentage of cases of death.\nYou are in China, right? Do you personally know a confirmed case? Do you know anyone who has passed away? Or just follow the numbers released and TV scenes on hospitals in alarm?\nThe last information I had is that the number of people infected by the second variant of the virus is already decreasing in China.\n\nWe now had carnival in Brazil and nothing different happened. For while no events have been canceled and the population is not so alarmed as to stop attending.\n\nAs I replied to Praxis, it's obvious that if that happens, the money will not be spent and will remain in the treasury.\nWe will spend less than what we asked to be available for the year. This can also happen without any event being canceled.\nIt's the first time that marketing is being decentralized. Everything is still experimental. If there is any possibility of spending less, you can be sure that I will spend less. \n\nWhat I don't agree with is starting to decentralize, thinking about do less than what has been done, when it is evident that there is a need to be seen more than we are.\n\nAbout the European proposal to be disapproved, I commented to Praxis that imho this happened due to the lack of information and because a realistic account was not made.\nYou can be sure that the next one will have a much higher value because $49,000 a year doesn't pay even half of their hours worked.\n\nLATAM and Brazil don't receive more for marketing than other regions. And we have given back a very good result.\nAny proposal with a value lower than ours will be unrealistic and will need another one after a few months to complement the costs.\nWe are being the first to try to decentralize these expenses and showing investors the amounts spent. \n\nYou can be sure that it would be much easier for us to continue as we did in 2019 and leave the accountability for @Dustorf to explain.\n\nThe Decred self-financing treasure through 10% of the coins mined in each block is an amazing feature developed among other things to invest in marketing. \n\nAs the currency appreciates, which I am sure will happen, that amount will correspond to a lower dcr value coming out of the fund\n\nI have faith that this bearmarket moment will end in 2021 and we will no longer need to spend so much on marketing.\nThe market will promote us.\n\nYou are the Asia community manager, right?\nI believe that when you elaborate your proposal, you will have a better idea of ​​the costs involved to create and maintain a strong community, with an independent ecosystem and with good investors.\n\nThanks for the questions!\n","signature":"c6b224a101c2631bf1b46da5f9e435276967d25232ac42ba4a26fe331ccc2d3ddfbd67601af7f27e07d8fb71c6cf13ba064d8a529cc4b05d51b84eb056957805","publickey":"c1cd38140c03bf6c34130ae6f89e592fb13ecad9b83aa660ffd8a74da4655d38","commentid":"14","receipt":"546da77dea4d77716e5da20c46e6c2d03523f5b324b9578eab4fa1be01c55e592c02a08911ad71523691a7af6bf66cf25c302dba43d53d36b02847eb8f145e09","timestamp":1583682309,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But the amount of community building work done and the commitment of people mentioned is a huge argument in favor of this proposal. The fact that emiliomann did a lot of outreach for Decred with his own funds and negotiated a lot of event slots for free makes me confident that he will spend Treasury funds carefully. I would love to see what BR community is capable of when supported by decent Treasury funding.\n\nHowever, I have a few questions and concerns that I would like to clear to help with my vote choice.\n\n1\\. My biggest issue with this proposal is that it lacks any details for its biggest item which is man hours.\n\n$78,000 is 3,900 hours at $20/hour, 1,950 hours at $40/hour and so on. I don't know the exact rates of each contractor (and not asking for them), but in any case it is _a lot_ of marketing hours. This amount deserves much more explanation than a single short bullet.\n\nI am further concerned that praxis [requested](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f986c3ea2fed2ea074c377a89f1a4b956ea0d527a8b6c099a5a8f175beb5/comments/1) to break down this figure 16 days ago but it was not done and the vote started without it. You [replied](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/bc20f986c3ea2fed2ea074c377a89f1a4b956ea0d527a8b6c099a5a8f175beb5/comments/2) that how much each contractor receives will not be disclosed to protect their privacy, but individual earnings is not what was requested. It was asking to provide a breakdown of deliverables and how much resources each will consume, similar to how it was presented in the [US Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af) proposal.\n\nI appreciate the background information and story in this proposal but when it comes to the key term of the contract all it says is \"Up to $78,000.00 for expenses with hours worked by more than 18 members.\". This is not telling me at all what the components are and if they have a reasonable price.\n\nWhile I trust that you will spend with great care, I don't know the same about others. I trust the \"I can assure you that my hours worked are the cheapest of the entire team\", but it is the _other_ hours I know nothing about. Besides, to my knowledge you as a proposal owner will not even be able to review, approve or reject expense items of other contractors (please correct me if it is possible in CMS now).\n\n2\\. Could you publish high level _monthly_ progress and expense reports (like [this one](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/marketing-latam/updates/20200103.md))? I think waiting a full year to get a report is too long. I wrote about why reporting is so important to keep stakeholders engaged in the [US Marketing](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af/comments/41) proposal and [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyqomn/).\n\n3\\. I know that Facebook and Instagram are dominant social media platforms in Brazil. Can you please comment on your strategy for making the best use of these platforms? e.g. do you have dedicated people to post frequently, how often do you plan to create and post new video/audio/articles, etc.\n\n4\\. What was the level of engagement with past Decred content in Portuguese? Is it falling/staying flat/growing?\n\nGood luck!","signature":"3fc5fa1b9f5194ac285e97e75720c08e97990f0d399e8b3318007a06e6ab091d67feb44b540e6380b6fe42d379ff41a520de1f6323f199b54c01fa0edb64410d","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"24","receipt":"b8b49799fc7ae0def5a520da6050307e22be822eb1b3bbb2c5abb043f3bd3f6ab6a69b2c886f0dc5dd5124c93936b71f487aaaa2ac56ff6f49ecd0a5fd4bd409","timestamp":1584911846,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
