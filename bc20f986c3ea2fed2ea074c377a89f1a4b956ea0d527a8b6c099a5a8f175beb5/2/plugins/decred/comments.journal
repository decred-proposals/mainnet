My initial reaction to this was: wow, quite bold to ask 2x more for one single country than the entire LATAM Proposal asked for, and almost 3x more than the entire European Proposal. Also, considering the latter got rejected at $50k (for the entire continent of Europe, and also included established members like karamble, haon), as a stakeholder I expect extraordinary evidence for why such a sum is justified.\n\nFor perspective, you ask for $125k for events in a single country, while the DEX, one of the most daring and infrastructurally central projects for the whole DCR ecosystem asked for between $100k and $250k.  Something seems off in this picture.\n\nIn the **Why?** section you list things that you believe set your community apart from the others, but what I would expect is something different: I would expect you to talk more about what justifies this sum for 2020. How old the community is, whether it was there before coin’s launch or not, shouldn’t be a reason to ask for a vastly larger sum.  The money Proposal submitters get on Pi shouldn’t be some kind of “loyalty reward” for being with the project for a long time.  I know you were promoting DCR from the earliest days, it goes way back to bitcointalk etc.  Still, that should play only a minor role, if any at all.   \n\nStatements about what the Proposal submitter *believes* to be the case are insufficient and require supporting evidence:\n\n\u003eI currently believe that we are only behind the USA in number of active members.\n\nWhat is this “current belief” based on, specifically?  Not necessarily denying this, but it would need an explanation: is it based on the metrics of some specific platform like Facebook?  Do you believe that to be an appropriate metric to gauge the sizes of the communities?\n\n\u003eWe’ve already had cases where the Decred website had more accesses from Brazil than from the USA.\n\nIs this anecdotal, from your memory, or is there a metric for this available somewhere?  Is the metric 'Sybil resistant'?\n\n\u003ethe BR community had around 5,000 members. Today, at the height of alt winter, we have around 6,000. We grew 20% while most other altcoins communities lost several members.\n\nIf the BR community is so vibrant and active, why do the YouTube videos have 20, 30, 40 views …? This is very low [Link to channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DecredBrasilOficial/)\n\n\u003eDuring the years 2016 and 2017 I paid for events and marketing campaigns for DCR in Brazil and also in other countries including the Middle East with my own money and in some cases with the help of other Brazilian members\n\nThat is wonderful and deserving of respect, however, it shouldn’t directly impact people’s decision regarding the adequacy of this proposal and its ask.\n\n\u003e $11,000.00 for sponsor and participation in around 8 big events, organization of around 13 meetups and small events.\n\u003e$22,000.00 for transport, accommodation and food expenses.\n\u003e$79,000.00 for expenses with hours worked by more than 18 members.\n\nCould you go into a little more detail about what this $80k of labour entails? Can you break it down a little?\nWe should also remember that the cost of living and average pay in Brazil is drastically lower than in Europe. When we consider this fact, doesn’t asking for 3x more than the European Proposal require more elaboration?\n\n---\n\nWith the outbreak of the Corona Virus, people are avoiding large public events. Many wealthy major corporations have publicly canceled their own events. Why should Decred Stakeholders finance costly Brazil meetups, can we count on these events producing tangible results regardless of a possible global pandemic?\n\n---\n\nAs someone who’s been with the project for a long time, you have witnessed how DCR struggled price-wise vs BTC in the last 2 years, don’t you think we should try to be austere in our spending, to avoid adding unnecessary sell pressure?\n\nIn any case, I look forward to your responses, and updates to the Proposal.
