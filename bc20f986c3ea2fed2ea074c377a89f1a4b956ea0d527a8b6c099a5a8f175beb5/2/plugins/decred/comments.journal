My initial reaction to this was: wow, quite bold to ask 2x more for one single country than the entire LATAM Proposal asked for, and almost 3x more than the entire European Proposal. Also, considering the latter got rejected at $50k (for the entire continent of Europe, and also included established members like karamble, haon), as a stakeholder I expect extraordinary evidence for why such a sum is justified.\n\nFor perspective, you ask for $125k for events in a single country, while the DEX, one of the most daring and infrastructurally central projects for the whole DCR ecosystem asked for between $100k and $250k.  Something seems off in this picture.\n\nIn the **Why?** section you list things that you believe set your community apart from the others, but what I would expect is something different: I would expect you to talk more about what justifies this sum for 2020. How old the community is, whether it was there before coin’s launch or not, shouldn’t be a reason to ask for a vastly larger sum.  The money Proposal submitters get on Pi shouldn’t be some kind of “loyalty reward” for being with the project for a long time.  I know you were promoting DCR from the earliest days, it goes way back to bitcointalk etc.  Still, that should play only a minor role, if any at all.   \n\nStatements about what the Proposal submitter *believes* to be the case are insufficient and require supporting evidence:\n\n\u003eI currently believe that we are only behind the USA in number of active members.\n\nWhat is this “current belief” based on, specifically?  Not necessarily denying this, but it would need an explanation: is it based on the metrics of some specific platform like Facebook?  Do you believe that to be an appropriate metric to gauge the sizes of the communities?\n\n\u003eWe’ve already had cases where the Decred website had more accesses from Brazil than from the USA.\n\nIs this anecdotal, from your memory, or is there a metric for this available somewhere?  Is the metric 'Sybil resistant'?\n\n\u003ethe BR community had around 5,000 members. Today, at the height of alt winter, we have around 6,000. We grew 20% while most other altcoins communities lost several members.\n\nIf the BR community is so vibrant and active, why do the YouTube videos have 20, 30, 40 views …? This is very low [Link to channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DecredBrasilOficial/)\n\n\u003eDuring the years 2016 and 2017 I paid for events and marketing campaigns for DCR in Brazil and also in other countries including the Middle East with my own money and in some cases with the help of other Brazilian members\n\nThat is wonderful and deserving of respect, however, it shouldn’t directly impact people’s decision regarding the adequacy of this proposal and its ask.\n\n\u003e $11,000.00 for sponsor and participation in around 8 big events, organization of around 13 meetups and small events.\n\u003e$22,000.00 for transport, accommodation and food expenses.\n\u003e$79,000.00 for expenses with hours worked by more than 18 members.\n\nCould you go into a little more detail about what this $80k of labour entails? Can you break it down a little?\nWe should also remember that the cost of living and average pay in Brazil is drastically lower than in Europe. When we consider this fact, doesn’t asking for 3x more than the European Proposal require more elaboration?\n\n---\n\nWith the outbreak of the Corona Virus, people are avoiding large public events. Many wealthy major corporations have publicly canceled their own events. Why should Decred Stakeholders finance costly Brazil meetups, can we count on these events producing tangible results regardless of a possible global pandemic?\n\n---\n\nAs someone who’s been with the project for a long time, you have witnessed how DCR struggled price-wise vs BTC in the last 2 years, don’t you think we should try to be austere in our spending, to avoid adding unnecessary sell pressure?\n\nIn any case, I look forward to your responses, and updates to the Proposal.

I was thinking you were taking too long to show up :D\n\nIf you pay attention, you will see that LATAM's proposal is for 6 months, totaling approximately a total of 144k per year.\nThe BR proposal involves expenses already in March, such as Campus Party Amazonia, therefore 10 months and with a maximum projection of 125k per year. \n\nAs it is written, Brazil has almost the same population of all other Latin American countries together, around 40%. Also almost the same area as all the others together. In addition, between Brazilian states there are great cultural and ethnic differences that don't exist or are very few between the Hispanic countries. For example, the state of Bahia is practically an African country within Brazil. The Amazon, an indigenous descendants country, more Japaneses lives in Sao Paulo than anywhere else in the world. Santa Catarina looks like a little Germany. Parana is known as \"Brazilian Russia\" and several other examples. Only those who have been here and got to know from north to south understand the differences. We are a lot of countries within a single country. \n\nRegarding the European proposal, imho, it's fail on some points. There is a lack of better detail to the requested amount that besides other things is insufficient even to pay the contractors working hours, so I believe it was not approved but I am sure that if it is redone more carefully, it will be successful.\n\nComparing marketing and events with DEX or another feature to be developed does not make any sense.\nBoth are important and totally different things.\n\nEach has its peculiarities in relation to cost. Development we are talking about hours worked and that deserve to be paid well.\nMarketing and events involve much more things and services from third parties. Air tickets, hotel, food, purchase of gifts, banners, assembly of booths, etc.\n\nAs an example, a place at Campus Party Sao Paulo costs from $ 50,000 to $ 400,000. We got it for free.\n\nThe DEX will be amazing, but decred is already an amazing currency.\nWhat is missing? Marketing. And this is not the time to reduce costs with this.\n\nGood marketing is what we do in Brazil and now we see Elian's team doing for Hispanic countries in Latin America as well.\nI don't see a reason why BR deserves a smaller budget than the rest of LATAM if it involves practically the same number of people in 26 states that are totally different from each other.\n\nYou approach Brazil in a prejudiced manner, saying that Europe's contractors should receive more, because here people are poorer and things cheaper. I don't condemn you because I consider the international and also the internal medias guilty of defending foreign interests in making us appear poorer and more savage than we are.\n\nAny promotional film or documentary about Brazil only shows poverty. I think Paris must have more homeless people than any Brazilian city that I know. I have seen images of bagda at war saying it was in BR.\n\nTake a look at the photos I put up of the meetups and you will see some Brazilian cities as they are. Of course, there is poverty here, but everywhere there is, the difference is that other countries hide it.\n\nAs written in the text, we have 7 devs of decred who are Brazilian, apart from the USA which other country has the same number?\nI don't think they should receive less just because they are Brazilian.\n\nYes, there are cheaper basic things here. Probably for a poor person it makes a difference, but for those who are middle class it is the opposite. A car that costs $70,000 in the USA, costs $180,000 in Brazil.\n\nFor reasons of privacy and security, an agreement was reached that it should not be disclosed how much each contractor receives, but I can assure you that my hours worked are the cheapest of the entire team, and by my choice. I dedicate much more hours a day to decred than I receive. But this is a personal decision of mine, you cannot reach a worker and say: \"you will receive less than him because you are a Latin American.\" Please ...\nTo be continued ...\n\nP.s. Sorry for delay, but you know that my English is terrible. I need to write and rewrite several times and our conversation is long.\n","signature":"effd95895eed0e4dcdfaecddbe00bf62ab4d646352ac26b90164e1b1ac7a7fcbe353c8580c730eafd4de8c0898e166ae6a2741011ad3c4d8c509af8101420603","publickey":"c1cd38140c03bf6c34130ae6f89e592fb13ecad9b83aa660ffd8a74da4655d38","commentid":"2","receipt":"cf5dfcbe93d2b89b38c1fc887ea4e560f9c025f43ba0ca74a16c0b2ff2c18e6ecb157f63c64f3d870a8127cbe5ab4ec044363417c85d3d160c7c8fdbcc21d70c","timestamp":1583541200,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
