Decred Brazil Marketing and Events Proposal

This proposal will follow the example of the Latin American Marketing and Events Proposal. Last year these local budgets were included in the global Events and Marketing proposals, but it was decided to decentralize the marketing efforts in 2020.


**What?**

This proposal asks for a dedicated budget for operating events, meet ups, sponsors and marketing in Brazil, including creation of marketing material, videos and other content in Portuguese.

Such content may also be used by countries that also speak Portuguese on four other continents: Portugal, Angola, Luxembourg (second language) and some cities in China (such as Macau). 


**Why?**

As mentioned in the proposal for LATAM, Brazil needs a separate proposal, given that we are at another stage of our local community’s development process. We speak a different language than the rest of LATAM, Brazil is very large (almost the size of Europe) and responds for around 40% of the entire Latin American population.

Brazil is composed of 26 States that have large cultural and ethnic differences between them.

The Brazilian (BR) Decred community is also one of the oldest ones, having been created by me before the coin was launched. We were the fourth country in number of participants during the airdrop, just behind the USA, UK and Germany.

I currently believe that we are only behind the USA in number of active members. We’ve already had cases where the Decred website had more accesses from Brazil than from the USA.

While creating a cryptocoin-related community is an achievement by itself, keeping its members engaged during the times of a bear market as the one we are going through is harder.

At the beginning of 2018, the peak of the bull market, the BR community had around 5,000 members. Today, at the height of alt winter, we have around 6,000. We grew 20% while most  other altcoins communities lost several members.

At the same time that we are a very large community, we also have great growth potential as we don't yet have organized groups in most states.

Some members of the Brazilian community developed startups and created uses for Decred's blockchain in addition to a currency:

- https://originalmy.com which proposes for the future to replace notaries using decred's blockchain to do registers. It has already been recognized as evidence in Brazilian courts.
https://www.cryptovibes.com/blog/2018/09/19/the-world-first-newborn-registered-on-decred-dcr-blockchain-is-a-brazilian/  

- https://votolegal.com.br that uses Decred blockchain technology to allow election campaign funding to be transparent and auditable by citizens and monitor if government plan and the public spending of politicians are being fulfilled.
3 candidates for president used it in the latest elections.


**How and Who?**

This proposal involves the work of: @emiliomann, @girino, @matheusd, @rhama, @michae2xl, @vctt, @tiagoalvesdulce, @thi4go, @guisso, @claranobre, @amanda, @victorguedes, @rafaela, @edsondecre, @lustosa, @cezardin, @bitg, @ibarth and other possible members of the community in specific works.

For those who don't know me, I'm @emiliomann, community manager in Brazil. I have been with Decred since before the launch. 

During the years 2016 and 2017 I paid for events and marketing campaigns for DCR in Brazil and also in other countries including the Middle East with my own money and in some cases with the help of other Brazilian members, thus creating one of the biggest DCR communities.

I think it's important to report this to show my commitment to the currency to see it grow while trying to keep costs as low as possible for the treasury.

We have several people in our community who were involved in the founding of the Brazilian cryptocurrency ecosystem, so we can manage to participate in all events as sponsors and speakers while paying very little or even for free. However, events like Campus Party, which happens for 5 to 6 days, 24h/day and where we present from 5 to 8 lectures per event need a big and organized team which results in a high cost related to hours worked, transport, hotel and food.

We usually participate in two big annual events.

The first one is Campus Party ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTy3Ehc22T8 )  which usually has 5 or 6 editions in different regions of Brazil and is one of the biggest tech events in the world. About 80,000 participants go through the São Paulo edition, which is the largest one in the world.

Campus Party happens 24 hours a day for up to 6 days and we always bring a great team to it. 7 Decred devs are Brazilian (@matheusd, @vctt, @fernando, @tiagoalvesdulce, @thi4go, @victorguedes, @guisso) and they, together with other members of the community, usually present lectures, workshops and other activities on these events.

Some lectures as example:
@guisso - Cryptography for children
@Thi4go - Consensus mechanisms in blockchain, the protocol of trust
@vctt - Lightning Network Blockchain and its second payment tier
@edsondecre - Startups and blockchain, the possibilities of blockchain beyond crypto
@Rhama - Using decred's blockchain for agribusiness
@girino - Decred - Proof of Stake, Governance and Atomic Swaps
@matheusd - Lightning fast payments: Lightning Network and other second-layer solutions
@claranobre - Introduction to Decred and Politeia

During the events we also promote activities for all the participants such as small hackatons, CTF - capture the flag games (using the Decred code), among others. All of them granting Decred-related prizes.

The second annual event is Bitconf, which is one of the oldest and the most attended bitcoin and cryptocurrency related conference in Latin America. It is the largest Brazilian event  directed exclusively at cryptocurrencies. 

While Campus Party is aimed at a younger audience, Bitconf draws a more mature crowd. Given it’s status as the main crypto/blockchain event of the year, it’s a focal event for the whole scene, including the grassroots community efforts, companies and large investors.
Jake Yocom-Piatt has already spoken at these 2 events.

In addition to these two major events, we usually hold several meetups in different cities in the country organized by local members.
This year (2020) we have already held 5 across the country to celebrate Decred's anniversary.

We currently have communities formed in 7 states: São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná, Goiás, Rio Grande do Norte and Bahia. We intend to continue strengthening them for attracting new investors and also creating new ones in the other 19 states of Brazil.

In the remaining months of 2020 we intend to participate and organize the following events:
- Campus party in Amazon, São Paulo, Goiás, Brasilia, Roraima and Bahia.
- Bitconf São Paulo
- Cointelegraph / Criptofacil Summit Rio de Janeiro (if still in time).
- Meetups in: São Paulo, Curitiba, Florianópolis, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, Goiania, Fortaleza, Natal, Recife e João Pessoa.
