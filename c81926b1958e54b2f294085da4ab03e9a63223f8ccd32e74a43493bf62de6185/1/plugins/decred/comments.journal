Here are my responses: \n\n**What have been your key learnings when pitching Decred to journalists in the last 6 months?**\n Take advantage of all available opportunities –  join existing crypto-related conversations in addition to pitching stories about Decred.\n \n**Have you noticed any particular narrative or project characteristic land with people more than others?**\nNot yet.\n \n**What have you found to be challenges with 'pitching' Decred?**\n Securing stories focused on the project when we don't have project news. However, we’ve managed to secure a steady media presence by sharing our expertise and viewpoints about key crypto news events.\n \n**Have you noticed an uptick in particular narratives in/around/beyond crypto that you think could provide a strong tail wind for future interest? **\n Weaknesses of the legacy financial system, which are becoming more apparent due to the impact of Covid-19.\n \n**How have you found the overall experience in terms of recruiting contributors from the community? **\n It has been a good experience, contributors are normally willing to draw up expert comments and thought leadership articles.\n \n**Were there any areas or articles where there was a request from journalists for contributions where there wasn't a suitable Decred candidate?** \n Occasionally, mainly because they were outside our area of expertise. \n \n**Overall how have you found the experience and the nature of the working for a (soon to be) DAO? Has it been easy / hard and in what way? **\n I’ve had a very positive experience. Although we are spread across many countries and time zones,  communication is excellent. I receive comments, approval, feedback, support etc. in a timely manner. This enables us to meet deadlines and capitalize on the majority of media opportunities. It’s also a very friendly and professional community to work with.\n \n**This is a little meta, but you are yourself an interesting subject since you are effectively dog-fooding a new way of working - might journos find this interesting - the personal story? **\n I prefer to stay behind the scenes and keep the focus on Decred and its spokespeople. I would consider it if the opportunity was right though.\n \n**What are are your ambitions for the next 12 months? More of the same?** \n Yes, the existing strategy includes both proactive and reactive PR outreach across multiple sectors and mediums, with the goal to secure a steady media presence.\n \n**Longer / more in depth features? **\n Absolutely, this is always the goal.  \n \n**Particular media focus - written / video / podcast / other?**\n The existing strategy includes outreach to all mediums, including online, print, radio, TV and podcasts. This would continue under this proposal.\n \n**Particular publications or narratives?**\n Crypto, personal finance, business, tech, investing. We keep the exact pitches private but the goal is to secure articles that communicate our key messages.\n \n**Is there any particular strategy that you are personally interested to advance?**\n I believe that a comprehensive PR strategy that covers all bases, as outlined in the proposal, is the best one.\n \n**Any challenges you see ahead with increased noise from soon to launch projects that might steal some of Decred's airtime on subjects such as governance / DAOs / sustainable funding? **\n Not in particular. We are always competing for limited airtime against the news agenda and other company/project news updates. If there are developments from other projects in the fields of governance, DAOs etc. these could be opportunities to insert Decred into the narrative, given that we’re leaders in these fields.

We have a collective of odd, pseudonymous, intelligent and interesting contractors who are all building a unique global currency network. There is talent we can draw on if you need to help shape up narratives and develop pitch ideas to some of your contacts to generate Decred specific content.\n\nPerhaps there is value in you providing us with insight into the type of content that gets clicks from these publications and we can start to generate content that has a higher likelihood of being picked up.  If governance and staking/remote work/financial perspectives/technical analysis gets clicks, we have a plethora of contractors well capable of creating content to fit the brief. If there are knowledge or information roadblocks, let us know so we can work together, break them down, and get Decred in the limelight.

There has been a strategy to secure Decred-specific content over the last six months. This has involved formulating story ideas with different angles about the project, including ones you've mentioned around remote working, financial prospectives and technical analysis. When developing these I look at the types of articles that are getting published to get a feel for what content publications want. I've also worked with community members for pitches that are more technical. So far these pitches haven't resulted in Decred-specific content, but have led to opportunities to be quoted in articles about the current news agenda.  The plan is to continue formulating and pitching story ideas to secure Decred-specific content and I'm definitely be open to ideas from the community and will think about ways to prompt more discussion around these.

Considering the cost, I think we get quite a lot of good PR work for the credits. \n\nI would be happy to see Lindsey continue in this role for another year to see how Decred's media presence develops. Considering there are major releases in the pipeline, this would not be a good time to pause PR in any case. \n\nWith regard to the coverage and placement of stories, I'm not sure about the value of placements on smaller sites, as there is little indication of whether anyone is reading them.
