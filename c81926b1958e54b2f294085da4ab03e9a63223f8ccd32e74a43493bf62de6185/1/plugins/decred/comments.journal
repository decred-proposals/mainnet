It would be useful to get a little more colour to the proposal as I'm sure you have a bunch of learnings over the last 6 months.  \n\n1. What have been your key learnings when pitching Decred to journalists in the last 6 months?\n - Have you noticed any particular narrative or project characteristic land with people more than others?\n - What have you found to be challenges with 'pitching' Decred?\n - Have you noticed an uptick in particular narratives in/around/beyond crypto that you think could provide a strong tail wind for future interest? \n - How have you found the overall experience in terms of recruiting contributors from the community? \n - Were there any areas or articles where there was a request from journalists for contributions where there wasn't a suitable Decred candidate? \n - Overall how have you found the experience and the nature of the working for a (soon to be) DAO? Has it been easy / hard and in what way? \n  - This is a little meta, but you are yourself an interesting subject since you are effectively dog-fooding a new way of working - might journos find this interesting - the personal story? \n\n2. What are are your ambitions for the next 12 months? \n  - More of the same? \n  - Longer / more in depth features? \n  - Particular media focus - written / video / podcast / other?\n  - Particular publications or narratives? \n  - Is there any particular strategy that you are personally interested to advance?\n  - Any challenges you see ahead with increased noise from soon to launch projects that might steal some of Decred's airtime on subjects such as governance / DAOs / sustainable funding? \n\nThanks and keep up the good work :) \n","signature":"45d297b9e7024a661743855a778fb9564b428eced5a21ff0e9c078a8c615eeb3e8b32d80bb3db0bc258051f4bf1a781d2c800775d9ee9e1c808f86a1a94df605","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"1","receipt":"9b1dcd3a14818fe913e2cc26aad3e4f475ea8360dff4fd75623ec21d3acd5f141186a4c36769238834b9b41a49463022994a5af29be26e9d1321aa86737a350f","timestamp":1594462297,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
