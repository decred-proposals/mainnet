It would be useful to get a little more colour to the proposal as I'm sure you have a bunch of learnings over the last 6 months.  \n\n1.

I see no reason why not to continue.

Here are my responses: \n\n**What have been your key learnings when pitching Decred to journalists in the last 6 months?**\n Take advantage of all available opportunities –  join existing crypto-related conversations in addition to pitching stories about Decred.\n \n**Have you noticed any particular narrative or project characteristic land with people more than others?**\nNot yet.\n \n**What have you found to be challenges with 'pitching' Decred?**\n Securing stories focused on the project when we don't have project news. However, we’ve managed to secure a steady media presence by sharing our expertise and viewpoints about key crypto news events.\n \n**Have you noticed an uptick in particular narratives in/around/beyond crypto that you think could provide a strong tail wind for future interest? **\n Weaknesses of the legacy financial system, which are becoming more apparent due to the impact of Covid-19.\n \n**How have you found the overall experience in terms of recruiting contributors from the community? **\n It has been a good experience, contributors are normally willing to draw up expert comments and thought leadership articles.\n \n**Were there any areas or articles where there was a request from journalists for contributions where there wasn't a suitable Decred candidate?** \n Occasionally, mainly because they were outside our area of expertise. \n \n**Overall how have you found the experience and the nature of the working for a (soon to be) DAO? Has it been easy / hard and in what way? **\n I’ve had a very positive experience. Although we are spread across many countries and time zones,  communication is excellent. I receive comments, approval, feedback, support etc. in a timely manner. This enables us to meet deadlines and capitalize on the majority of media opportunities. It’s also a very friendly and professional community to work with.\n \n**This is a little meta, but you are yourself an interesting subject since you are effectively dog-fooding a new way of working - might journos find this interesting - the personal story? **\n I prefer to stay behind the scenes and keep the focus on Decred and its spokespeople. I would consider it if the opportunity was right though.\n \n**What are are your ambitions for the next 12 months? More of the same?** \n Yes, the existing strategy includes both proactive and reactive PR outreach across multiple sectors and mediums, with the goal to secure a steady media presence.\n \n**Longer / more in depth features? **\n Absolutely, this is always the goal.  \n \n**Particular media focus - written / video / podcast / other?**\n The existing strategy includes outreach to all mediums, including online, print, radio, TV and podcasts. This would continue under this proposal.\n \n**Particular publications or narratives?**\n Crypto, personal finance, business, tech, investing. We keep the exact pitches private but the goal is to secure articles that communicate our key messages.\n \n**Is there any particular strategy that you are personally interested to advance?**\n I believe that a comprehensive PR strategy that covers all bases, as outlined in the proposal, is the best one.\n \n**Any challenges you see ahead with increased noise from soon to launch projects that might steal some of Decred's airtime on subjects such as governance / DAOs / sustainable funding? **\n Not in particular. We are always competing for limited airtime against the news agenda and other company/project news updates. If there are developments from other projects in the fields of governance, DAOs etc. these could be opportunities to insert Decred into the narrative, given that we’re leaders in these fields.
