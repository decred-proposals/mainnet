The Journal is a solid monthly summary that even covers external issues related to DAOs and governance, but I'm not familiar with its development process.

This is very much the natural approach for the Decred community to take, because trying to enforce adherence to particular messaging would be at odds with how contributors usually relate to each other. Embracing the \"headless brand\" is a natural progression for Decred.\n\nI appreciate the detail on the budget and all of the line items seem reasonable to me, everything covered by this proposal is valuable and produced to a high standard, in my estimation. Good call on the cost cutting for Decred Assembly.\n\nAs someone who works on some of the aspects of this proposal, thanks for putting together a proposal that covers these smaller sub-projects, so that the rest of us can focus on our respective pieces of the larger effort!\n","signature":"6173c10be6cc8a569b61dbbd68662d4022c5fc613eed6d9d5739f6678fe41f153b3625754f443b4e411d8564d75e59d204cbfd72db055023e5b0096db005560e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"e4adee912b9f98513728c90dde1b907fd24afa4b0228736047379711e038c16df4f1e5984caa411eef4bca984e5b09d590d6da68cf81b3165976154e587bf700","timestamp":1583859336,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The Decred Journal is expensive to produce because it's essentially an internal news department that aggregates all the information and makes editorial decisions about what qualifies, what doesn't, and what gets pushed to the top.  bee has an established outline that he clones for each new month, and an image is requested of the design team. Contributors track the various categories throughout the month, adding meat to the bones of the working document on GitHub. Once the month is over, the work moves into overdrive, when all the aggregated figures for developer activity are added and editorial decisions are made. Documentation for contributors can be found here: https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md\n\nThe total costs in the proposal include all translations, which have been narrowed over time. My direct involvement is narrow, and bee is much more in tune with the process, so he will provide further detail. The Journal is a comprehensive synopsis of the month in Decred, which makes it a nice reference document for the newsletter. There was also discussion this morning to use some of the technical content via social media to increase the focus on developer activity.","signature":"9a831b0674c36eefceb56d7f638317c4d0c4f15e6784c95efaa5d5cc588129d2107334be6199a33632e31bd7af56a26e8dd6b6f474e36e09a66053783aba8500","publickey":"f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087","commentid":"3","receipt":"2230fe0998b451b32e09e5ab0204a033067cc30e7badf9f9a38d7a33846a979bce1cfff8f0e8686371fee64751a8aa7127f85d4b911221e11f176b41eae54503","timestamp":1583863984,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The production output of the people involved is impressive and I don't know of any CC or \"traditional\" project, that can have that much work done by quality people at that price.\n\nOn a different note, I know the DCR trading price will always be part of the equation and that when it's low, choices will be harder, especially for marketing efforts and community Organizing. However I take my \"job\" as a stakeholder very seriously,  and I feel the content enabled by this proposal is essential in order to keep myself up to date with everything going on in the project.

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article. \n\n- What is the advantage of hiring a studio for the In Depth episodes, in your opinion? Is doing it in a studio versus just having Skype calls like the old Assembly worth it for the cost? While it's nice and all, I'm not sure I find it necessary. \n\n- Similarly, what is the original content generation that costs $2k per article, could you expand on that a little bit? Could you break this down to explain the cost?\n\n- Are the songs that are produced for DCR included in this, and what is the cost for each song (I mean the hip hop tracks etc. I wonder why that is missing from the breakdown)?\n\n- iirc you chose to cancel some event due to coronavirus, understandably, so do you think the LATAM \u0026 BR \u0026 other future Proposal should consider doing something similar? With the current situations, large events with many people are dubious\n\n---\n\nThanks for responses.

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article.\n\n$750 is an estimated monthly average for the year, a month can have multiple issues and even then most months would be well under $750. I have just calculated the average for the last 6 months and it is around $450/month. \n\nOver the course of a year there may be some very busy months or proposals that are particularly important or have a lot of activity/changes and take longer to write up. So with that in mind, and the general expectation that things will tend to become more active over time, not less, $750/month seems like a good budget to set for it.","signature":"139bb5493d3e0e5f26f5a9c2cbba2a399c9346582717b9565caa5adefd5658b61230d570ea914944ca6cbd7ba87b5dabedcff93fef8e7cc9166e8da04b71380f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"11","receipt":"138b84c32674b4599638571a9b71acc928ab02982502990a65cce36ecf091f33bfb36db7f83c1a9b3fea1ad943e18b91d8bdd67be2189ff3c330726e125b4e0b","timestamp":1583950131,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A lot went into the formation of this proposal and the evolution of its construct, and I hope that we're moving in the right direction as a community in how things work. The macro economy, markets, and coronavirus have certainly informed this proposal as well. I do know that some of the LA events have already been canceled, and BR events are likely to suffer the same fate. In fact, the coronavirus enabled for the exclusion of events that would have been expensive and I felt we would have been compelled to attend.  I'll answer your questions in order, with the exception of the first, as richard has already done so.\n\nDecred Assembly-we're going to produce the Assembly much like it was back in the day. We will need to buy a camera, and Exitus will do the editing and graphic work in house. As such, we were able to reduce the cost per episode by more than 50%.\n\nOriginal content. This budget will likely support the production of far more than 12 articles. All work is done at an hourly rate and billed against the proposal.\n\nThe songs are included in the Decred in Depth cost estimate. Perhaps they should have been broken out, but I sided with brevity on the proposal.\n","signature":"9adb3ad51876b2f3383adbfdd3565a5f4e01d1d8ab1816dda8b22a001b2b9a4a49708ed2c71ec511d61edda0940529ee03690a2e2cab002eeffe43159c149c0d","publickey":"f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087","commentid":"13","receipt":"a10a1b121341bba30f17806c02c455d5de5df8d4f2475b3d0ad74cffed2a2a6daa9e35a78f5d870b65814baae40eb53d2cfa15fc4ce89e2b85369b4394c4d701","timestamp":1583957438,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Worthy of being the flagship.\n\nThe community organizer portion of this proposal may need to be reconsidered in light of Covid, even though it hurts me to say that since events can achieve very high returns on marketing spend when executed and measured effectively.\n\nThis brings me to the primary concern I have with the overall proposal. \n\nAnd it's actually a common thread in most DCR marketing proposals (e.g. Brazil, Europe, 2019 marketing and events). \n\nAs a stakeholder, I ultimately want to have the same level of confidence in the value that the community gets from the DCR marketing spend as we have in the integrity of the DCR chain.  \n\nThat may be unrealistic today, I realize, but that's a worthy goal (and arguably non-negotiable) to effectively enable a truly decentralized marketing organization, particularly one that has global ambitions.\n\nThe challenge I have with all of these marketing proposals is that I don't see  any type of rhythm around reporting or even target metrics. That's a symptom. The disease is lack of accountability.\n\nWe may want to \"build awareness of Decred and develop tools\", but a year from now in the 2021 budgeting discussion, how will stakeholders know whether the investment moved the needle or not?  While we're at it, how will we know a quarter or a month from now?\n\nAwareness can also mean different things to different people as well, so a clear target would prevent misunderstanding. It would also reduce grumbling along the way. \n\nLastly, I'm not 100% clear why Decred needs a Jan 1-Jan 1 marketing budgeting process. But that's a different point.\n\nThe 2019 marketing report by dustorf reinforces some of these concerns.  \n\nWhile there are some legitimate wins and a proven ability to execute against content, it's not clear to me how the 785k USD benefited the community in a concrete way. \n\nIt's no one's fault, since no one really brought it up in the proposal stage the year before. It's hard to have any type of accountability in a marketing org (centralized or decentralized) if you don't set the high-level goals at all.\n\nEven after multiple pages in, I know what was spent in 2019 (which is great, assuming it's accurate), but I didn't see any helpful marketing metrics to help me assess the impact of these outlays.\n\nIf none, then we can call it \"learning,\" which is fine,  particularly for an ecosystem this young. However, I am not clear what the guidance should be after discovering that \"Decred T-shirts provide good branding around an event.\"\n\nFurthermore, I am confused by the state of the PR function.  \n\nThe 2019 report highlighted a Positive as \"Decred experimented with competitive pitch / hired Ditto PR (highly engaged Politeia proposal).\" However, the 2020 proposal indicates that MondePR is the new firm.  Back in my marketing days, it would easily take 2-3 months to really get a PR firm (of any quality) up to speed.  Maybe I'm old and slow, but even so, that's low ROI on a PR team investment, imho.  Unless Decred has two PR firms, which seems like overkill. \n\nIt just sounds more like it should be a negative. I certainly can relate to that. World-class PR is notoriously difficult to find and I got it wrong more than once.\n\nWhat I see in all of these proposals is a passionate commitment to Decred and a lot of activity. Much of it is, I am sure, very good and undoubtedly genuine value for the money.\n\nWhat is missing for me, and which would help me make a more informed and educated decision about whether to support a marketing proposal or not, is for the proposal submitters to not confuse the high-level execution of marketing activities with the desired outcomes of the community.\n\nI think a marketing proposal should force that conversation by suggesting a few that could be indicative of success (hopefully!) or failure. \n\nAt the same time, I think the community needs to take an active role is helping to set the proper marketing goals to reflect the desired outcome (e.g. build awareness).","signature":"e3d7de035a0c874553addad2dfaf0038b07081e0bad6d1c50e63b6aef57a7725131b717dba8b4f18f6f1f3b641262d645650618946cd54776f48ef86ec7e4507","publickey":"947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7","commentid":"15","receipt":"e446cb4e70e7328c65109d1c45416f008e745369ef03f1810b2ff31152a262fd1ede3e29e3ebaddde4a22bdacac6aba1afa5f71a3d34ffb17eeb3dfec615a209","timestamp":1583960695,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here is my reasoning which is through my own experience and witnessing others. I believe what marketing is, is planting seeds so to speak. Along with planting seeds, every person needs a different number of seeds to be planted in them to win them over (meaning they invest/join). The quality of presentation can be seen as how many seeds are being planted in each person in that one session. So lets say it was a good presentation, 5 seeds were planted in everyone. Well John needs 10 seeds, Susie needs 20, Bob only needed 5. Therefore Bob has joined the community, John is halfway there (he will probably join when he hears the news that the DEX is released, that will be worth another 5). And Susie needs the presentation+the DEX+ price to go up+her trusted friend to recommend it to her to meet her quota of 20 seeds....Now for my personal experience. I came from the Digibyte community. Jared the founder occasionally listed DCR as a solid coin. I kept seeing that. Also on twitter a trusted person I followed kept harping on how great DCR was (this went on for months) but hey, I was happy with DGB so I didn't give it much of a look (this could be the equivalent of doing marketing and no one joining, it feels like a failure, but there was still value transferred). It wasn't until I came across Checkmate's material that made me jump in. I wouldn't have jumped in so fast and hard if the previous seeds weren't planted, I wouldn't have trusted it enough. I think marketing starts the lindy curve so to speak. The name gets out there, people hear it and just based on that, I think it starts to be trusted kinda like how a politician has a much greater chance of being elected if people recognize their name.","signature":"111fc037664033063925707b5c7a2dde05a4cbd8ad15067bac2b29df184642736cb2bef2af7fc2bc8718b51d8385826bed9226a81dddb1776f08e2f607ff2709","publickey":"9104b1853e1097fbd14d13018a9a51c537c16d173cda56ae91166e2dd27fe04d","commentid":"16","receipt":"6a5f65c21fa12720b7cc43f5613aa5ac0f4168049c7d73b3ba33db791038cfa108c35dbd66f591c1b03234b273fc96d1c4f6bd76cc54a442b7f47d5a09b17e0f","timestamp":1583976426,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
