The Journal is a solid monthly summary that even covers external issues related to DAOs and governance, but I'm not familiar with its development process. Didn't expect it to be the most expensive tactic.\n\nCould you or @bee provide some details on how each edition of the DJ is worked out? Does its budget include translations and development work to automate even more sections?","signature":"463581fa47ce37d323880b6afa35c0ad5e6d24c0d514de5062cecd49383fafb666c9cea87cec10ca26b78f517feea7b3c002d88afd907bc50ee0be494f9bb706","publickey":"78d8ff0b05d20c593ab45a2ff3d55dd61b421bc599585e6c5cc2e409947dd950","commentid":"1","receipt":"218f9ceb3849ea7f133347529922e161bd7535fa75cce27782479f3924a6753710084ebed10d52643a9b55b88ca98c23fc3b1e88498040da7239c52408c20209","timestamp":1583855222,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is very much the natural approach for the Decred community to take, because trying to enforce adherence to particular messaging would be at odds with how contributors usually relate to each other. Embracing the \"headless brand\" is a natural progression for Decred.\n\nI appreciate the detail on the budget and all of the line items seem reasonable to me, everything covered by this proposal is valuable and produced to a high standard, in my estimation. Good call on the cost cutting for Decred Assembly.\n\nAs someone who works on some of the aspects of this proposal, thanks for putting together a proposal that covers these smaller sub-projects, so that the rest of us can focus on our respective pieces of the larger effort!\n","signature":"6173c10be6cc8a569b61dbbd68662d4022c5fc613eed6d9d5739f6678fe41f153b3625754f443b4e411d8564d75e59d204cbfd72db055023e5b0096db005560e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"e4adee912b9f98513728c90dde1b907fd24afa4b0228736047379711e038c16df4f1e5984caa411eef4bca984e5b09d590d6da68cf81b3165976154e587bf700","timestamp":1583859336,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The Decred Journal is expensive to produce because it's essentially an internal news department that aggregates all the information and makes editorial decisions about what qualifies, what doesn't, and what gets pushed to the top.  bee has an established outline that he clones for each new month, and an image is requested of the design team. Contributors track the various categories throughout the month, adding meat to the bones of the working document on GitHub. Once the month is over, the work moves into overdrive, when all the aggregated figures for developer activity are added and editorial decisions are made. Documentation for contributors can be found here: https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md\n\nThe total costs in the proposal include all translations, which have been narrowed over time. My direct involvement is narrow, and bee is much more in tune with the process, so he will provide further detail. The Journal is a comprehensive synopsis of the month in Decred, which makes it a nice reference document for the newsletter. There was also discussion this morning to use some of the technical content via social media to increase the focus on developer activity.","signature":"9a831b0674c36eefceb56d7f638317c4d0c4f15e6784c95efaa5d5cc588129d2107334be6199a33632e31bd7af56a26e8dd6b6f474e36e09a66053783aba8500","publickey":"f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087","commentid":"3","receipt":"2230fe0998b451b32e09e5ab0204a033067cc30e7badf9f9a38d7a33846a979bce1cfff8f0e8686371fee64751a8aa7127f85d4b911221e11f176b41eae54503","timestamp":1583863984,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
