The Journal is a solid monthly summary that even covers external issues related to DAOs and governance, but I'm not familiar with its development process. Didn't expect it to be the most expensive tactic.\n\nCould you or @bee provide some details on how each edition of the DJ is worked out? Does its budget include translations and development work to automate even more sections?","signature":"463581fa47ce37d323880b6afa35c0ad5e6d24c0d514de5062cecd49383fafb666c9cea87cec10ca26b78f517feea7b3c002d88afd907bc50ee0be494f9bb706","publickey":"78d8ff0b05d20c593ab45a2ff3d55dd61b421bc599585e6c5cc2e409947dd950","commentid":"1","receipt":"218f9ceb3849ea7f133347529922e161bd7535fa75cce27782479f3924a6753710084ebed10d52643a9b55b88ca98c23fc3b1e88498040da7239c52408c20209","timestamp":1583855222,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is very much the natural approach for the Decred community to take, because trying to enforce adherence to particular messaging would be at odds with how contributors usually relate to each other. Embracing the \"headless brand\" is a natural progression for Decred.\n\nI appreciate the detail on the budget and all of the line items seem reasonable to me, everything covered by this proposal is valuable and produced to a high standard, in my estimation. Good call on the cost cutting for Decred Assembly.\n\nAs someone who works on some of the aspects of this proposal, thanks for putting together a proposal that covers these smaller sub-projects, so that the rest of us can focus on our respective pieces of the larger effort!\n","signature":"6173c10be6cc8a569b61dbbd68662d4022c5fc613eed6d9d5739f6678fe41f153b3625754f443b4e411d8564d75e59d204cbfd72db055023e5b0096db005560e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"e4adee912b9f98513728c90dde1b907fd24afa4b0228736047379711e038c16df4f1e5984caa411eef4bca984e5b09d590d6da68cf81b3165976154e587bf700","timestamp":1583859336,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
