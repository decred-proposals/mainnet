The Journal is a solid monthly summary that even covers external issues related to DAOs and governance, but I'm not familiar with its development process.

This is very much the natural approach for the Decred community to take, because trying to enforce adherence to particular messaging would be at odds with how contributors usually relate to each other. Embracing the \"headless brand\" is a natural progression for Decred.\n\nI appreciate the detail on the budget and all of the line items seem reasonable to me, everything covered by this proposal is valuable and produced to a high standard, in my estimation. Good call on the cost cutting for Decred Assembly.\n\nAs someone who works on some of the aspects of this proposal, thanks for putting together a proposal that covers these smaller sub-projects, so that the rest of us can focus on our respective pieces of the larger effort!\n","signature":"6173c10be6cc8a569b61dbbd68662d4022c5fc613eed6d9d5739f6678fe41f153b3625754f443b4e411d8564d75e59d204cbfd72db055023e5b0096db005560e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"e4adee912b9f98513728c90dde1b907fd24afa4b0228736047379711e038c16df4f1e5984caa411eef4bca984e5b09d590d6da68cf81b3165976154e587bf700","timestamp":1583859336,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The Decred Journal is expensive to produce because it's essentially an internal news department that aggregates all the information and makes editorial decisions about what qualifies, what doesn't, and what gets pushed to the top.  bee has an established outline that he clones for each new month, and an image is requested of the design team. Contributors track the various categories throughout the month, adding meat to the bones of the working document on GitHub. Once the month is over, the work moves into overdrive, when all the aggregated figures for developer activity are added and editorial decisions are made. Documentation for contributors can be found here: https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md\n\nThe total costs in the proposal include all translations, which have been narrowed over time. My direct involvement is narrow, and bee is much more in tune with the process, so he will provide further detail. The Journal is a comprehensive synopsis of the month in Decred, which makes it a nice reference document for the newsletter. There was also discussion this morning to use some of the technical content via social media to increase the focus on developer activity.","signature":"9a831b0674c36eefceb56d7f638317c4d0c4f15e6784c95efaa5d5cc588129d2107334be6199a33632e31bd7af56a26e8dd6b6f474e36e09a66053783aba8500","publickey":"f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087","commentid":"3","receipt":"2230fe0998b451b32e09e5ab0204a033067cc30e7badf9f9a38d7a33846a979bce1cfff8f0e8686371fee64751a8aa7127f85d4b911221e11f176b41eae54503","timestamp":1583863984,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The production output of the people involved is impressive and I don't know of any CC or \"traditional\" project, that can have that much work done by quality people at that price.\n\nOn a different note, I know the DCR trading price will always be part of the equation and that when it's low, choices will be harder, especially for marketing efforts and community Organizing. However I take my \"job\" as a stakeholder very seriously,  and I feel the content enabled by this proposal is essential in order to keep myself up to date with everything going on in the project.

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article. \n\n- What is the advantage of hiring a studio for the In Depth episodes, in your opinion? Is doing it in a studio versus just having Skype calls like the old Assembly worth it for the cost? While it's nice and all, I'm not sure I find it necessary. \n\n- Similarly, what is the original content generation that costs $2k per article, could you expand on that a little bit? Could you break this down to explain the cost?\n\n- Are the songs that are produced for DCR included in this, and what is the cost for each song (I mean the hip hop tracks etc. I wonder why that is missing from the breakdown)?\n\n- iirc you chose to cancel some event due to coronavirus, understandably, so do you think the LATAM \u0026 BR \u0026 other future Proposal should consider doing something similar? With the current situations, large events with many people are dubious\n\n---\n\nThanks for responses.

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article.\n\n$750 is an estimated monthly average for the year, a month can have multiple issues and even then most months would be well under $750. I have just calculated the average for the last 6 months and it is around $450/month. \n\nOver the course of a year there may be some very busy months or proposals that are particularly important or have a lot of activity/changes and take longer to write up. So with that in mind, and the general expectation that things will tend to become more active over time, not less, $750/month seems like a good budget to set for it.","signature":"139bb5493d3e0e5f26f5a9c2cbba2a399c9346582717b9565caa5adefd5658b61230d570ea914944ca6cbd7ba87b5dabedcff93fef8e7cc9166e8da04b71380f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"11","receipt":"138b84c32674b4599638571a9b71acc928ab02982502990a65cce36ecf091f33bfb36db7f83c1a9b3fea1ad943e18b91d8bdd67be2189ff3c330726e125b4e0b","timestamp":1583950131,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
