The Journal is a solid monthly summary that even covers external issues related to DAOs and governance, but I'm not familiar with its development process.

This is very much the natural approach for the Decred community to take, because trying to enforce adherence to particular messaging would be at odds with how contributors usually relate to each other. Embracing the \"headless brand\" is a natural progression for Decred.\n\nI appreciate the detail on the budget and all of the line items seem reasonable to me, everything covered by this proposal is valuable and produced to a high standard, in my estimation. Good call on the cost cutting for Decred Assembly.\n\nAs someone who works on some of the aspects of this proposal, thanks for putting together a proposal that covers these smaller sub-projects, so that the rest of us can focus on our respective pieces of the larger effort!\n","signature":"6173c10be6cc8a569b61dbbd68662d4022c5fc613eed6d9d5739f6678fe41f153b3625754f443b4e411d8564d75e59d204cbfd72db055023e5b0096db005560e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"e4adee912b9f98513728c90dde1b907fd24afa4b0228736047379711e038c16df4f1e5984caa411eef4bca984e5b09d590d6da68cf81b3165976154e587bf700","timestamp":1583859336,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The Decred Journal is expensive to produce because it's essentially an internal news department that aggregates all the information and makes editorial decisions about what qualifies, what doesn't, and what gets pushed to the top.  bee has an established outline that he clones for each new month, and an image is requested of the design team. Contributors track the various categories throughout the month, adding meat to the bones of the working document on GitHub. Once the month is over, the work moves into overdrive, when all the aggregated figures for developer activity are added and editorial decisions are made. Documentation for contributors can be found here: https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md\n\nThe total costs in the proposal include all translations, which have been narrowed over time. My direct involvement is narrow, and bee is much more in tune with the process, so he will provide further detail. The Journal is a comprehensive synopsis of the month in Decred, which makes it a nice reference document for the newsletter. There was also discussion this morning to use some of the technical content via social media to increase the focus on developer activity.","signature":"9a831b0674c36eefceb56d7f638317c4d0c4f15e6784c95efaa5d5cc588129d2107334be6199a33632e31bd7af56a26e8dd6b6f474e36e09a66053783aba8500","publickey":"f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087","commentid":"3","receipt":"2230fe0998b451b32e09e5ab0204a033067cc30e7badf9f9a38d7a33846a979bce1cfff8f0e8686371fee64751a8aa7127f85d4b911221e11f176b41eae54503","timestamp":1583863984,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The production output of the people involved is impressive and I don't know of any CC or \"traditional\" project, that can have that much work done by quality people at that price.\n\nOn a different note, I know the DCR trading price will always be part of the equation and that when it's low, choices will be harder, especially for marketing efforts and community Organizing. However I take my \"job\" as a stakeholder very seriously,  and I feel the content enabled by this proposal is essential in order to keep myself up to date with everything going on in the project.

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article. \n\n- What is the advantage of hiring a studio for the In Depth episodes, in your opinion? Is doing it in a studio versus just having Skype calls like the old Assembly worth it for the cost? While it's nice and all, I'm not sure I find it necessary. \n\n- Similarly, what is the original content generation that costs $2k per article, could you expand on that a little bit? Could you break this down to explain the cost?\n\n- Are the songs that are produced for DCR included in this, and what is the cost for each song (I mean the hip hop tracks etc. I wonder why that is missing from the breakdown)?\n\n- iirc you chose to cancel some event due to coronavirus, understandably, so do you think the LATAM \u0026 BR \u0026 other future Proposal should consider doing something similar? With the current situations, large events with many people are dubious\n\n---\n\nThanks for responses.

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article.\n\n$750 is an estimated monthly average for the year, a month can have multiple issues and even then most months would be well under $750. I have just calculated the average for the last 6 months and it is around $450/month. \n\nOver the course of a year there may be some very busy months or proposals that are particularly important or have a lot of activity/changes and take longer to write up. So with that in mind, and the general expectation that things will tend to become more active over time, not less, $750/month seems like a good budget to set for it.","signature":"139bb5493d3e0e5f26f5a9c2cbba2a399c9346582717b9565caa5adefd5658b61230d570ea914944ca6cbd7ba87b5dabedcff93fef8e7cc9166e8da04b71380f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"11","receipt":"138b84c32674b4599638571a9b71acc928ab02982502990a65cce36ecf091f33bfb36db7f83c1a9b3fea1ad943e18b91d8bdd67be2189ff3c330726e125b4e0b","timestamp":1583950131,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A lot went into the formation of this proposal and the evolution of its construct, and I hope that we're moving in the right direction as a community in how things work. The macro economy, markets, and coronavirus have certainly informed this proposal as well. I do know that some of the LA events have already been canceled, and BR events are likely to suffer the same fate. In fact, the coronavirus enabled for the exclusion of events that would have been expensive and I felt we would have been compelled to attend.  I'll answer your questions in order, with the exception of the first, as richard has already done so.\n\nDecred Assembly-we're going to produce the Assembly much like it was back in the day. We will need to buy a camera, and Exitus will do the editing and graphic work in house. As such, we were able to reduce the cost per episode by more than 50%.\n\nOriginal content. This budget will likely support the production of far more than 12 articles. All work is done at an hourly rate and billed against the proposal.\n\nThe songs are included in the Decred in Depth cost estimate. Perhaps they should have been broken out, but I sided with brevity on the proposal.\n","signature":"9adb3ad51876b2f3383adbfdd3565a5f4e01d1d8ab1816dda8b22a001b2b9a4a49708ed2c71ec511d61edda0940529ee03690a2e2cab002eeffe43159c149c0d","publickey":"f3f7cc551f53c4532026f57a27477e7c057b15ce55d093f5129971a7bcfac087","commentid":"13","receipt":"a10a1b121341bba30f17806c02c455d5de5df8d4f2475b3d0ad74cffed2a2a6daa9e35a78f5d870b65814baae40eb53d2cfa15fc4ce89e2b85369b4394c4d701","timestamp":1583957438,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Worthy of being the flagship.\n\nThe community organizer portion of this proposal may need to be reconsidered in light of Covid, even though it hurts me to say that since events can achieve very high returns on marketing spend when executed and measured effectively.\n\nThis brings me to the primary concern I have with the overall proposal. \n\nAnd it's actually a common thread in most DCR marketing proposals (e.g. Brazil, Europe, 2019 marketing and events). \n\nAs a stakeholder, I ultimately want to have the same level of confidence in the value that the community gets from the DCR marketing spend as we have in the integrity of the DCR chain.  \n\nThat may be unrealistic today, I realize, but that's a worthy goal (and arguably non-negotiable) to effectively enable a truly decentralized marketing organization, particularly one that has global ambitions.\n\nThe challenge I have with all of these marketing proposals is that I don't see  any type of rhythm around reporting or even target metrics. That's a symptom. The disease is lack of accountability.\n\nWe may want to \"build awareness of Decred and develop tools\", but a year from now in the 2021 budgeting discussion, how will stakeholders know whether the investment moved the needle or not?  While we're at it, how will we know a quarter or a month from now?\n\nAwareness can also mean different things to different people as well, so a clear target would prevent misunderstanding. It would also reduce grumbling along the way. \n\nLastly, I'm not 100% clear why Decred needs a Jan 1-Jan 1 marketing budgeting process. But that's a different point.\n\nThe 2019 marketing report by dustorf reinforces some of these concerns.  \n\nWhile there are some legitimate wins and a proven ability to execute against content, it's not clear to me how the 785k USD benefited the community in a concrete way. \n\nIt's no one's fault, since no one really brought it up in the proposal stage the year before. It's hard to have any type of accountability in a marketing org (centralized or decentralized) if you don't set the high-level goals at all.\n\nEven after multiple pages in, I know what was spent in 2019 (which is great, assuming it's accurate), but I didn't see any helpful marketing metrics to help me assess the impact of these outlays.\n\nIf none, then we can call it \"learning,\" which is fine,  particularly for an ecosystem this young. However, I am not clear what the guidance should be after discovering that \"Decred T-shirts provide good branding around an event.\"\n\nFurthermore, I am confused by the state of the PR function.  \n\nThe 2019 report highlighted a Positive as \"Decred experimented with competitive pitch / hired Ditto PR (highly engaged Politeia proposal).\" However, the 2020 proposal indicates that MondePR is the new firm.  Back in my marketing days, it would easily take 2-3 months to really get a PR firm (of any quality) up to speed.  Maybe I'm old and slow, but even so, that's low ROI on a PR team investment, imho.  Unless Decred has two PR firms, which seems like overkill. \n\nIt just sounds more like it should be a negative. I certainly can relate to that. World-class PR is notoriously difficult to find and I got it wrong more than once.\n\nWhat I see in all of these proposals is a passionate commitment to Decred and a lot of activity. Much of it is, I am sure, very good and undoubtedly genuine value for the money.\n\nWhat is missing for me, and which would help me make a more informed and educated decision about whether to support a marketing proposal or not, is for the proposal submitters to not confuse the high-level execution of marketing activities with the desired outcomes of the community.\n\nI think a marketing proposal should force that conversation by suggesting a few that could be indicative of success (hopefully!) or failure. \n\nAt the same time, I think the community needs to take an active role is helping to set the proper marketing goals to reflect the desired outcome (e.g. build awareness).","signature":"e3d7de035a0c874553addad2dfaf0038b07081e0bad6d1c50e63b6aef57a7725131b717dba8b4f18f6f1f3b641262d645650618946cd54776f48ef86ec7e4507","publickey":"947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7","commentid":"15","receipt":"e446cb4e70e7328c65109d1c45416f008e745369ef03f1810b2ff31152a262fd1ede3e29e3ebaddde4a22bdacac6aba1afa5f71a3d34ffb17eeb3dfec615a209","timestamp":1583960695,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here is my reasoning which is through my own experience and witnessing others. I believe what marketing is, is planting seeds so to speak. Along with planting seeds, every person needs a different number of seeds to be planted in them to win them over (meaning they invest/join). The quality of presentation can be seen as how many seeds are being planted in each person in that one session. So lets say it was a good presentation, 5 seeds were planted in everyone. Well John needs 10 seeds, Susie needs 20, Bob only needed 5. Therefore Bob has joined the community, John is halfway there (he will probably join when he hears the news that the DEX is released, that will be worth another 5). And Susie needs the presentation+the DEX+ price to go up+her trusted friend to recommend it to her to meet her quota of 20 seeds....Now for my personal experience. I came from the Digibyte community. Jared the founder occasionally listed DCR as a solid coin. I kept seeing that. Also on twitter a trusted person I followed kept harping on how great DCR was (this went on for months) but hey, I was happy with DGB so I didn't give it much of a look (this could be the equivalent of doing marketing and no one joining, it feels like a failure, but there was still value transferred). It wasn't until I came across Checkmate's material that made me jump in. I wouldn't have jumped in so fast and hard if the previous seeds weren't planted, I wouldn't have trusted it enough. I think marketing starts the lindy curve so to speak. The name gets out there, people hear it and just based on that, I think it starts to be trusted kinda like how a politician has a much greater chance of being elected if people recognize their name.","signature":"111fc037664033063925707b5c7a2dde05a4cbd8ad15067bac2b29df184642736cb2bef2af7fc2bc8718b51d8385826bed9226a81dddb1776f08e2f607ff2709","publickey":"9104b1853e1097fbd14d13018a9a51c537c16d173cda56ae91166e2dd27fe04d","commentid":"16","receipt":"6a5f65c21fa12720b7cc43f5613aa5ac0f4168049c7d73b3ba33db791038cfa108c35dbd66f591c1b03234b273fc96d1c4f6bd76cc54a442b7f47d5a09b17e0f","timestamp":1583976426,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I agree that measuring and setting goals is the best way to go, and I would be more than happy to add these to the proposal so long as the community agrees to what they are and how they are measured. Follower counts on all social media and communications platforms are reported monthly in the Decred Journal. Internally, we do follow and track the project's twitter account performance. We also know that roughly 43% of the followers are not legitimate. YouTube and social platforms have their own metrics: impressions/views, reads, likes, shares, etc., but the community tends to be skeptical that these metrics can be easily gamed or manipulated. Additionally, each new convert is not equal. The addition of a developer might be more valuable than a passive holder. Something brought richard red, checkmatey, degeri and others into the project. The collective thinking here is that the creation of quality content that serves Decred's mission we beget more quality contributors and establish a narrative of what it means to be part of Decred. Perhaps you could share specific ideas for metrics and we could agree on what they should be. r/decred on Reddit is probably a good spot for that.\n\nRegarding Lindsey from Monde coming up to speed quickly, you're correct to think that this is unusual.

That particular issue was probably the shortest one yet, with only a single new proposal reported on.\n\n\u003e it is typical for contractors who use treasury funds to explain the amount they are taking. \n\nI gave a figure of $450/month for the last 6 months, what more do you need?\n\n\u003e cannot take more than 1 hour per article\n\nThey do indeed take more than 1 hour per article to write. To convey what happens with a proposal over the course of a week or two means reading it in depth, maybe multiple versions to track changes as that is a particular weak point of the user experience. Although the interface handles it well, it is fundamentally difficult to follow a conversation where the proposal evolved over time. I also read the comments and try to give a reasonable account of how people commented and voted. \n\nWhether this is worth doing is up for debate. At the start there were some shortcomings in the information available about proposals and I was mostly using Pi digest to plug gaps. Over time most of the important information has become available through the proposals site itself and also dcrdata, so Pi digest is less needed for that kind of purpose. I think the summaries of proposals and their comments are useful for stakeholders who do not have the time to follow proposals in depth, or at least that is my motivation for doing it. Keeping the digest concise is one of the aims, but just because something is short doesn't mean it can be written very quickly.\n\nHaving said that, Politeia Digest is not usually one of the more compelling things for me to work on, so I won't be put out if community members think I should stop doing it. Will consider, if people have an opinion about it in either direction please make it known.","signature":"49751e814539a8b1798db9b56cb3300cbc39dd12ce5aee09b6a20cd6e88cdb862e0994fb5d94f7e418e316736a558c5e92438f222601b76f832baf9bff0c410e","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"20","receipt":"c81f652ee21882e967982bd334ebd038870408f1d011c47903f39322f1c97fe91bfd795c05ed96a32c8707a911802ffe2048f5cc08b66c41e1bb36701e851d06","timestamp":1584043993,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Good to know. \n\nI agree w/you about the gaming of metrics as a risk. No question that is a point of vulnerability.\n\nIf the community is satisfied with marketing expenditures based on the assumption of  \"the creation of quality content that serves Decred's mission we beget more quality contributors and establish a narrative of what it means to be part of Decred,\" that's fine with me. \n\nIt's not a bad premise. All I am saying is, next year, after your team creates more quality content,  what kind of \"begetting\" are we hoping for to assess whether the effort yielded positive results?\n\nAs for specific metrics, if I spent a few hours w/you or someone else who is more immersed in DCR, we could probably come up with some for initial proposal for the community to assess and debate.  You rightly point out the need for the  community  to agree \"to what they are and how they are measured.\"\n\nA simple exercise for you and the community might be: \nA year from now, how will we know we have grown in terms of market awareness, perception, and membership?\n\nIf I had to guess, I think some of the marketing metrics of a crypto network will come down to how wallets and tokens \"behave.\"  \nFor example, are more people staking/voting?\nAre new wallets getting created that then acquire new tokens?\n\nAlternatively, \nAre new Dapps getting created? Are they being used?\nNew integrations?\n\nOn a different vector, are there more GitHub commits from more people?\n\nI'm sure some of these can be gamed, but those are some initial thoughts. I'll think more.\n\nI did write an e-book on Decentralized Marketing Organizations. Perhaps there are some nuggets in there (but probably not!)\nhttps://www.neverstopmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Decentralized-Marketing-Organizatio-How-Crypto-Marketers-Can-Increase-Token-Value-by-Empowering-Community-Members.pdf\n\nI still maintain that it is the primary responsibility of the marketing proposer to put forth the initial set, however.  ;-)\n","signature":"aa3b51b59bfffc83e9d489eadd20b316026070a9463c4523cbef43a773b3491970413c98a65318c14e8600cc19bab155aa826cfcb781c605cda4155b1f822c00","publickey":"947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7","commentid":"24","receipt":"75518ff0d388f447661e206d08fb08ad6d1c14667a924d7cdad71d33392f366a6ef5225944d248f4d3ae43f0977eac40e17066d71dd5bd3224d281881bde9a02","timestamp":1584243299,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It could help instead of trying to chase down the chatroom/twitter/reddit convos. Maybe we already have something like this that I don't know about. But anyways I personally am getting off twitter and the chats because I can't handle it (addiction). It would be nice for people in a similiar situation as me (or maybe I'm the only one lol) to be able to throw around ideas occasionally. Also would be a good spot to have all the debates about how we can't measure marketing or ways we can start to measure it, instead of clogging up some of the proposals with them. Maybe we need a forum lol.

This proposal has been revised to be pretty austere already. If this doesn't pass, there's a danger Decred loses a good chunk of its community.

Even just getting this proposal passed is marketing in itself. Everyone can share it on social media platforms saying, Hey, We at Decred just approved a proposal paying out 175k to 18 different contributors or whatever (while every other blockchain is holding on for dear life). We obviously have to be smart with our funds but we need to be investing in our most loyal members that are willing to contribute. If they are declined here, they might not take the time and energy to put in the work coming up with future proposals. It's like the butterfly effect in a way, it can really change the momentum and energy. Also I don't think we can always be holding off for a better price until we make moves. That opportunity might not come, nobody truly knows.

A precedent has been set, and every corporation will be made whole. Currently, a universal basic income is being put forth-a new entitlement that will not be revoked. This will be massively larger than 2008, and nothing will ever be the same.\n\nThe legacy system is proving that it is systemically built to fail. I agree that attention is currently on the health crisis, but once that situation gets settled or becomes the new normal, a flood of people will become interested in this new form of money that brings with it a deterministic supply and a new way to organize people and assets. I believe we're better off continuing to create quality content so there is plenty of life within Decred and there are plenty of reasons for people to join when they experience the disillusionment.

I could only listen ~8 episodes but liked them all. It is a good resource to learn about the project _and people_ behind it, most content will stay relevant for years, and the audio format is flexible.\n- Glad to see Decred Drive getting funded! DecredDragon has proven his commitment and self-managed a consistent stream of releases.\n- I like that this proposal includes expenses since Jan 1st. This way there is no period of expenses that go unvoted. Ideally we would not have a weird situation where we vote for past expenses, but it is better to vote and express my opinion after the fact, rather than having no vote for them at all and be uncomfortable about that.\n- I'm sad about canceling university outreach but it's the right thing to do right now. Glad it was considered anyway. Perhaps we can find other ways to get there (e.g. contribute to online blockchain courses?).\n- Appreciate cutting the costs.\n- As a DJ writer I thank you for the trust and for funding our work.\n\n### Not liked\n\n- The lack of any reporting commitment specified in the proposal (more on that below).\n- I'm not too excited about \"Original Content Generation\" item. The [linked posts](https://medium.com/@dlefebvr) are not bad but 2K/piece looks overpriced for their size. The [2019 marketing report](https://blog.decred.org/2020/02/26/Decred-2019-Marketing-Report/) is perhaps worth 2K but it is much bigger.\n- If one newsletter issue is only top 5-10 stories, simplified for casual reader, and is based on other content, $500/piece looks overpriced. Unless each piece includes unique image design, which I think it should not.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Can you please elaborate why Monde PR needs a 1K/month management overhead in addition to its 3.5K/month base cost? We often talk about how our contractors must self-manage so I'm a bit confused about this.\n- To what extent this proposal can fund DJ translations? Are all translations getting funded? What was the past spend on translations and what is projected for 2020, given that the amount of translations [fluctuates](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) each month?\n- Is it possible to have the keynotes files available outside of the proprietary Notion platform? In what format are they stored there?\n- Does \"Updates to websites\" include web development costs or only content updates (i.e. text and graphics)?\n- Can you please give a hint on how coordinating one release consumes 6K?\n- What are some example deliverables included in \"Marketing Updates\"? It lists keynotes, business brief and the website but it's not clear to me how that takes 20K.\n- Since this proposal includes expenses that already took place since Jan 1 (which I like), what would we do about these expenses if the proposal is rejected?\n- I would appreciate if you could answer the [questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyq6g9/) I posted in the 2019 report discussion. I'm confused about some expenses and it would be great to clear that up before I vote on this one.\n\n### Notes\n\n\u003e Decred Journal: A team of roughly one dozen community members, currently led by @bee.\n\nTo clarify, the current set of \"core\" contributors doing most of the work is 5 people. This is not to downplay all other contributions, but rather to avoid overpromising on the decentralization. I'd love to have [a few more](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/contributing.md) people who can translate the dev logs to English and take some other tasks.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1\\. Monthly progress and expense reports.\n\nI would really like to see them as part of this and all other proposals. I don't want to be in the dark until missing accountability features are implemented in CMS and Politeia. They were [criticized](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/591#issuecomment-485869331) earlier, now they seem to be understaffed and have low priority and may take many more months to deploy. After 1.5 years of Politeia's operation and millions of dollars approved we still don't have basic reporting and accountability tools in Pi, and the proposal owners in general seem to not have the \"inner urge\" to consistently report to the stakeholders.\n\nI agree with jer979 that \"The disease is lack of accountability\". I believe we can cure it and it's not so hard once you get used to it. I wrote more on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyqomn/). It is my fault that I didn't post this earlier when it was still possible to edit the proposal but nothing stops from adopting this approach regardless. We can use the [proposals](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals) repository until Pi gets the missing features.\n\nNote that this is different from what we put in DJ, because DJ tries to cover _all_ marketing activity without specifying which proposal it is funded by, if any.\n\n2\\. Prepare the yearly report and the 2021 proposal earlier to minimize the amount of time we're running on unapproved funds. The schedule could look like:\n\n- throughout each month: throw notes into draft report\n- end of each month: publish monthly report\n- early December: start yearly report based on monthly reports (it's easier when you don't start from scratch)\n- early December: start drafting and iterating next proposal\n- late December: add things happened in December, finalize report, publish\n- late December: publish 2021 proposal after the report, give ~2 weeks to discuss\n- ideally the vote should end by ~mid Jan\n\nSee also:\n\n- My article on [marketing strategies](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html)\n- My comments and recommendations in the 2019 marketing report [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/)","signature":"14e570ddabdff98aed26bb36479f060ca2b41dffb6a0168badc3b148ac1062283aab3cc36d95acb770931ac25013043b2f104569cae716fc2fa558a41cf1a104","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"41","receipt":"0c52bb1a17c4b37319ac62194984bc8404f390ee4eb2d09c5bb9dd2e2c5446f58d41bb16ac4730bc5b8112c134dad56928e2eb71c6b53c1229acfbbad2129d0c","timestamp":1584735095,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It requires some dev-expertise hours to distill a dozen Git repositories, compile what's happening there and translate to English that is semi-readable by non-developers.\n\nAnother thing adding to the cost is our discipline of checking facts, always linking to source (an average issue has more than 200 links!), and reviewing multiple times before releasing.\n\nTo get an idea of how each issue is produced you can read our extensive [production guidelines](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/guidelines.md).\n\nOver time we've removed some parts that are tedious and yield little value, like the the index of interesting chats that was present in earlier issues.\n\nSpeaking of automation, we use the [contributor tracking](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) tool to detect new people. I don't know if it is done with DJ budget, but in any case I don't think it costs too much. Other than that I'm not aware of any dev work billed as DJ. If anyone is willing to help with automation, we have a [content outline](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/blob/docs/content.md) that marks such opportunities. Some parts of DJ are incrementally made easier by improvements in dcrdata, and I [submitted](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1214) a few requests of missing features. But that is funded by the currently-informal dev budget.\n\nMind that DJ leverages a lot of knowledge accumulated by its contributors over the yeras and a lot of time they spend in Decred spaces (of which a lot is not billed).

This is like a 2017 ICO level payment for a short article.\n\nI'll add to richardred's comments that:\n\n- The level of skill and knoweldge utilized to produce those is above average. I don't know exact numbers but I assume this labor also costs more than average. Quite fairly, IMO.\n- I guess the price is fair and richardred would earn more doing same kind of work on a normal job in a developed country.\n- It is shorter when there's little activity and longer when there's more activity. For example [issue 27](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue027/) covers more stuff and is longer than the one you linked. Some issues like [21](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue021/) even include analysis and charts. The [issue](https://medium.com/politeia-digest/issue-28-feb-12-mar-1-2020-8e78bc0888a4) you linked happens to be 3rd smallest issue ever and about half of the historical average size. But because of hourly billing, small issues like this are cheaper than the average figure provided.\n- Note that $750 per issue is a convenient limit to accomodate more work if it happens, but any not done work is not billed.\n- It is an open market. If someone shows up and offers to produce the same coverage but cheaper, Politeia Digest will have to compete or shut down.","signature":"63563a4eaa26f7b7d2dfeae1a7c28f77726faec6616772d68a145edac007180d134a1ba8ffc7056d7f0e70e6496b16d6899a959f0bd8fbf4f6689c8a2c520805","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"43","receipt":"8df78f004229c9a586384a2b934397cff0065e4251fcbcf292477146356623f3244b1318ac7bfb06d8aba198c58f126e6b19cef9d8f325e0dc83019d75fd9809","timestamp":1584735901,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I believed in social media stats until I learned there's a nice market to just buy them in bulk. Git commit counts are not representative because they wildly wary in quality, significance and time to produce (e.g. 1 commit in dcrd that took 40 high expert hours is more significant than 100 GUI polishing commits in a secondary project). Market stats like volume can be spoofed.\n\nBut we do need to find working metrics. Some ideas for quarterly/yearly metrics:\n\n- The number of organizations (and people working in them) and individuals who adopted DCR as a medium to receive donations and funding, based on their alignment with Decred values. (This is in line with my [argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/fa70c3/decred_2019_marketing_report/fkyqrl3/) for adding MoE and money to our message, because I believe the non-speculative adoption starts with people making the conscious choise to accept DCR for their work and products)\n- Amount of software and services that integrated Decred and their significance (partly measured by their reported user counts and amount of service rendered).\n- Counts of contributors joined/left Decred.\n- Amount of full nodes serving the network _and_ lighweight client nodes using DCR. We need some monitoring tools to get that data. Here's an [open issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/1214), feel free to comment to show higher demand for it.\n\n_P.S.

DCR average price over the past nine months is around $19.\n- Passing on high-quality proposals because the price is experimenting a dip will have a deflationary impact on the project on the long run: in terms of new proposals, quality of proposals and finally in terms of price. Now is the right time to continue our marketing effort and expenses.  Why? Because crypto is on the verge to become mainstream (cf crypto law in EU, Bakkt gigantic series B etc.)\n- Marketing remains the key contributor to the visibility and price performance of a project. **Decred is at a too-early stage to pass on those marketing expenses no matter what is the market situation. **\n- This proposal has a high(er) budget, but the content produced is of excellent quality with motivated and skin-in-the-game contributors. This proposal leverages all this knowledge and might bring more people on board as investors but also as contributors and contractors: networks effects take time to materialize but once that do they are irreversible. \n\nLet's not be scared!

As only a worker, I might be inclined to try and defend my \"territory\" so that I can keep earning income from it, but because I am a stakeholder as well I take a broader view. I would be happy to see the things I provide covered better by others at lower cost. This also means I am not inclined to low-ball the cost estimates, because that might discourage others from considering it.\n\nAnother factor here is that the scope of how we can push the Decred project forward is so broad that there's no danger of running out of useful things to do.

My nanny has unexpectedly quit without notice, and I will not interview or break quarantine until I deem it is safe. My kids are little, so my hands will be full. As such, the cost of the proposal will be reduced, particularly in the near term.
