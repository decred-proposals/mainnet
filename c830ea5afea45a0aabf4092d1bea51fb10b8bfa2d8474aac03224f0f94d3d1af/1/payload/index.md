US Marketing & Project Release Coordination 2020

**Why?**

In 2019, I passed two proposals - one for Marketing and one for Events - in an effort to gain stakeholder approval via Politeia for much of the existing spend. 

The intention was to help formalize spending within the DAO structure, where stakeholders have the power to authorize expenditures but contributors have the autonomy to make decisions within an approved framework. 
The stated goal was to help establish parameters to determine how this new type of organization will run. 

At the end of the proposal funding period, I published a 2019 [Marketing Report](https://blog.decred.org/2020/02/26/Decred-2019-Marketing-Report/) detailing all marketing expenses, analyzing what worked and what didn’t, and making a series of recommendations for the future.

This new plan takes into consideration recommendations from the report, and continues to decentralize the marketing function. This proposal’s objectives are to:
*  Continue to build awareness of Decred and develop tools to enable the community
* Facilitate and manage public relations efforts
* Facilitate messaging and release plans for new software


**How?**

All roads lead to Decred is a well known phrase used in the community.

For many contributors their involvement with the project has come through the realization of just how future facing the project has been since it was first proposed. Other, better funded and more vocal projects, are now trying to solve issues that the project has already worked through.

Decred takes an educational rather than a marketing approach which we believe aligns better with the project's constitution and values.
By sharing project insights and experience openly and generously with the wider crypto community in the spirit of open source collaboration, such as with [Checkmatey’s recent post on Eth Governance](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/observing-ethereum-governance-during-the-progpow-debate-9bf1aec724ad), we believe this will advance the whole community, whilst maintaining and advancing the projects thought leadership. 

The proposed output is as follows:
*  Build out the publishing arm of Decred
    *  Decred Journal: Well known to much of the community, the Decred Journal is a comprehensive synopsis of monthly news about Decred, plus the most important external news and information. Past editions can be found on the [Decred Medium](https://medium.com/decred) page or on [GitHub](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/releases). The Journal is regularly [translated into other languages](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/), including Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Polish, and more. Details of translations can be found here. The Journal will be used as source material for the newsletter.
    *  [Politeia Digest](https://medium.com/politeia-digest): Regular updates on proposal activity and results. This work is typically re-purposed for the Journal. 
    *  [Decred Drive](https://medium.com/@decreddrive): A weekly synopsis published to Medium of everything going on in and around Decred. This will be used as source material for the Journal.
    *  Monthly Email Newsletter: Based on Journal content, an easy to review and digest, less technical series of stories designed to enable more people to keep up with Decred. The newsletter will include the most topical 5-10 stories, and will include links to longer form coverage such as the Journal, external sites, or internal chats. There will be a sign-up link on the website.
    *  Ongoing content generation to support releases and Decred philosophies. Topics include sovereignty models, DAOs, new ways to organize work, privacy, DEX, governance, and more. Examples of previous work can be found here: https://medium.com/@dlefebvr
    *  [Decred in Depth Podcast](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/): Hosted and produced by Mr. Black, a deep dive with Decred community members on topics of interest. The podcast was well-received last year, and will expand this year to include Rough Consensus, featuring technical analysis with @checkmatey_ and @permabullnino_, as well as episodes that explore the big ideas behind Decred such as privacy, sovereignty, governance systems, and digital commons.
    *  [Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaMrpvQ0yJ_z8ZtvgBqinmL74_0W7prv2): A YouTube video co-hosted by Project Lead, jy-p and Dustorf, featuring developers and their most recent releases. In order to reduce costs, videos will be shot in house and edited by @Exitus, and guests will appear in person or via Skype. Episodes are planned to support the DEX release, incremental privacy release, Lightning Network updates, Treasury work, and consensus work.
*  Community Organizers: To expand Decred communities across strategic markets within the United States. Attend crypto and other meetups, organize quarterly events, promote locally, social media activity, exchange outreach, swag etc. Target markets include: Chicago (Dustorf), Los Angeles (Mr. Black, permabullnino_), NYC (TBD), San Francisco (TBD). Depending upon the extent of the covid-19 outbreak, this work may be completely scrapped.
    *  University outreach: Coordination with universities to offer lunch & learns to explain why crypto is interesting, describe the current ecosystem, and explore why Decred is unique and how people can contribute. These presentations will be recorded and posted to the YouTube channel. From the initial presentations, determine areas students and faculty would like to explore in more depth. This could range from computer science to economics, finance to public policy. University targets include:
        *  The University of Chicago
        *  Northwestern University
        *  University of California-Berkeley
        *  Stanford University
        *  Columbia University
        *  New York University
    *  Local Bitcoin & Blockchain organizations, privacy groups, trading groups, etc. 

*  Public Relations Coordination: The community has approved Monde PR in a recent proposal. My work will help direct  Lindsey’s efforts, qualify and determine opportunities, and facilitate or create content. This includes message development, targeting, spokesperson cultivation, coaching and more. 
*  Release Planning and Coordination: Work with the Decred developers to coordinate the promotion of releases, including:
    *  Messaging 
    *  Keynote preparation
    *  Communication with other geographic leads and community
    *  Media (articles, podcast, video, public relations)
*  Ongoing Updates to Marketing Materials (including design)
     *  Development of [keynotes](https://www.notion.so/Decred-Keynotes-5c3fdfb0a73841c0a394efe002003409): Intro to Decred (updated), DEX, Privacy (when iterated), Lightning Network, Decred Governance Systems, Intro to Crypto, Crypto Ecosystem. These presentations will be recorded and published to the YouTube channel.
    *  Updates to Business Brief
    *  Updates to website (articles, releases, etc.)
