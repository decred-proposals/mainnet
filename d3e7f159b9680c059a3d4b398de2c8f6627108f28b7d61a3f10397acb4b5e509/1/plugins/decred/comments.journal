Late to the party, but let me try:\n\n* What is the reasoning of not bundling this together with Marketing 2019, and why some meetups and quarterly events are part of Marketing 2019 and not this proposal?\n* How do you feel about the ~$400K spent on events in 2018? Was it worth it and why?\n* Is there (or will there be) a breakdown of 2018 events expenses?\n* Based on indirect observations I always perceived Consensus as a money making machine for the organizers. Note that events are completely not my domain, I'm just curious as a stakeholder. iirc Decred was on one Consensus before, was it worth the ~$50K and why?\n* I would love to see Decred in front of [CCC and FOSDEM](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/83) attendees, they might have a ton of engineers for whom 'sovereignty' means something. Is facilitating those in the power of this proposal?\n* Reporting was a common omission for events. There was very few reports, a lot of talks were not recorded, the information was not nicely organized. Now that event expenses are brought to stakeholder ratification, it is reasonable to agree on reporting schedule. Ideally, for every event there is someone responsible for producing and sharing a report that would include (or link to) a text writeup, total expense and any recorded photos/video/audio. Ideally, all reports are organized in something like decred-events repo, while large media materials are self-hosted on some file server.

I’ll respond to each of them in the order you presented them.\n\n* I broke apart the Events from the Marketing Proposal because I didn’t want to present too much in a single proposal. Events were a primary tactic of Decred last year, so it seemed like a natural split. I’ve broken out the local meetups from these events because the meetups are done more autonomously by community members across the world. These events are slightly more centralized, as they’re planned by the Decred team in Matrix, not simply any individual who wants to coordinate something for Decred. Based on the input I’ve received on each proposal, I might propose more than two to break out separate, chunky ideas as their own proposals.\n\n* As a disclaimer, I was not involved in the event decision making process last year, and I was only involved in the planning for WebSummit. I understand what was done and why, and I believe there are certainly areas where we can optimize our presence. I’ll speak to those later, as you ask explicitly in your last question.\n\nLast year, the project had stronger purchasing power and event attendance was strong. It’s easy to see why the decision was made to attend the events we did. Whether it was worth it is an interesting question, in part because there’s no counterfactual we can point to. I’ve seen many of the benefits myself when I talk about events and marketing plans for 2019 in that these events have brought our community members together, expanded our community, and enabled cooperation. Examples:\n\nAt NABTC in January, 2018, the Decred team met Sid Maresh, who is now, more than a year later, helping to organize the San Francisco community with regular Decred meetups. The first one is March 6, 2019 featuring Luke Powell and the Placeholder VC team. This is a strategic area rich with devs fluent in Golang. There’s massive potential to add devs, expand the community in a strategic location, and bring more contributors to the project.\n\nIn 2018, Decred attended events across Europe, enabling communities to form that have become autonomous. The UK team and the Polish teams have formed bonds and are working on behalf of Decred without the need for centralized coordination. I propose one large event per continent, in large part, to enable teams to form that can operate more autonomously in their region.\n\n* Expenses for the 2018 events were given to me as a single, lump sum approximation by jy-p. I would bet that he prefers to spend his time on new features rather than old accounting, but that’s up to him.\n\n* Consensus is likely the most important annual event because it attracts the right people. Relationships with individual contributors, developers, media, other contributors and potential partners in the ecosystem, media, and strategic partners matter. It’s the single place everyone congregates, and the face time we get is where we can help solve challenges such as a lack of liquidity, lack of awareness, and so on. Trading volume was extremely high around that time, and the value of Decred was extremely high, particularly in relation to BTC. It’s not the place you’ll find bee, but it has value to the project.\n\n* CCC and Fosdem are definitely in play. In the past, I’ve attempted to get traction for Fosdem and GopherCon, but the point of failure has been the unwillingness of Decred team members with strong technical skills to attend the events. It’s only developers who can vet other developers, so they’re a necessary component. If you can help facilitate their attendance, I’m in full support.\n\n* Events happen, but it’s critical to maximize the value and the legs of the events. We can do this through reporting, which can help us improve and optimize our presence and spending. Heyvj has established a method for documenting events [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Event-Report-Template), which I’ve contributed to for NABTC, and which will be a standard practice for all events covered in this proposal. These should be completed within one week of the event.\n\nAs you mention, events generate content of two types where Decred can more strongly convert upon going forward. The first part, you mention is video content. When Decred representatives speak at events, they demonstrate authority on a topic, and we would like to propagate that as much as we can. I believe we can leverage that content both on YouTube, as well as our updated website. The second type of content we can leverage is simply imagery related to the events. JZ has brought up the idea of always having a designated photographer at an event to document things. This helps yield social media content in real time, and also contributes to a digital asset repository that has multiple benefits, including for media coverage.","signature":"58e93b0fbb0e02698addaa604f9f11edae1d0ee79787d8c90c6a8799549649d5eecacdf6840a862600644e5fe473b63b9f862f30df348d2fb60c3be32c850608","publickey":"2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","commentid":"14","receipt":"231c9370ece084e52ceb22722f390e70e5dd61657945f7e8bdc07d8f22c89d3d349d6d1d70ecb85a8affcfe312affaa172c419ecdeeeb2927ac572b288021502","timestamp":1551286212,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
