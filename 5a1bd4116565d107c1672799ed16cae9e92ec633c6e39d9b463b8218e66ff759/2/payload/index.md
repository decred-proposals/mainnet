Open DotA 2 Pubs for Decred Purse

**What**

The Zebbu Open Esports League is aiming to hasten the intersection of crypto and gaming. My mission is to teach new people about crypto while they compete for it. I will aim to promote and distribute DCR to competitors gleaned from gaming communities, thus bringing visibility and distribution of Decred to many young, tech savvy gamers. Think of it as GPU mining with added biochemical entropy in the form of players.

**Why**

Crypto is a pretty insular community. You’re in, or you’re out. This game would be an open invitation to the world, an open door to gamers to become Decred users. I think that small-scale cash games represent a huge potential application for crypto, and present a unique distribution opportunity.

As entry to this game is free, I think of this as an “almost-airdrop.” Airdrops are tricky. It’s great to grow your network, but if you give somebody something for free, why would they value it? DCR you compete for isn’t “free.” It costs time, attention, and effort rather than money.

I have hosted a DotA tournament with ZEC rewards, and results were great. Participants were excited to learn about and save their new ZEC.

I think it’d be good if crypto started obviously DOING things, even if they look silly in the future. Bitcoin Pizza Day is historic for a reason. Yes the tech is young, yes I think it’s growing, but I don’t think that’s a good reason not to use it now. I believe crypto needs to look a lot more active, fun, and inclusive. This proposal aims to do just that.

**How**

I will promote, organize, and broadcast cash games of DotA 2 with rewards paid to the winners in DCR. The prize pool will be paid evenly to the 5 members of the winning team.

This awards 5 people with DCR at the end of the game.The prize pool is flexible and I’d welcome any and all thoughts on what would be best for this. 5 DCR would mean one per player, which, to me, is satisfying and sounds like a fair incentive.

Players will have to register their teams with a corresponding DCR address (or 5 addresses). Teams will be given a password to access the game. Entry preference will be given to teams that have not yet won a bounty. The games will be played in Captain’s Mode as a Best-of-Three (BO3). I will attempt to balance skill levels of competitors to the best of my ability.

I will stream and cast the BO3 (maybe on an official Decred twitch channel? Or on my channel: twitch.tv/zebbufund (If so, I will change my avatar’s eyes)). This will mean 2-3 hours of entertainment, with decent break time to discuss decred. I would be happy to run informational videos about Decred or reading aloud promotional material approved by the community during introduction/downtime.

Prizes represent the majority of this funding request. If I held one game per week with a prize of 5 DCR, that’s 20 DCR/month, creating (ideally) 5 new holders a week, or 20 per month, off the airdrop aspect. Requiring a wallet to sign up will make more people than just the winners learn what Decred is (and see its beautiful software!) Streaming the game will give us a great opportunity to promote the currency and its self-funding aspect in a fun and exciting way.

I would ask for 2 DCR (~$32)/week (8 DCR/month) as my personal compensation. This seems reasonable considering  the workload of promoting, organizing, streaming, and casting this game (~6 hrs/week? Probably more. I understand this is a bear market and I am trying to reflect that by bidding ~$5/hour). This would bring the project cost to 7 DCR (~$112)/week.

**Who**

Literally anyone with a DotA squad will be allowed to join. Entries will be solicited in gaming communities, rather than cryptocurrency communities, as the primary aim is to introduce and distribute Decred to new users.

The game will be organized, streamed, and hosted by me, Zebbu. I’m not really anybody special, just a gamer and crypto fan. You can read my tweets at @ZebbuFund. 

**When**

I believe this should happen fairly regularly if we hope for it to grow. I believe once a week on Saturday night would be best. 

**Request Details**

For the sake of testing this on a small scale, I am only requesting only 1 month worth of funding, or $450. (~28 DCR at current value) 

For this I would stream 4 BO3's in a month, yielding 9-15 hours of live content that would also be hosted indefinitely on Youtube. This would also hopefully onboard new users, at least 20 new holders, with many more possible via exposure. I will request further funding in the future conditional on the success of this modest trial.
