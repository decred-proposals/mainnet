I think it's an interesting idea and I agree that there is potential for a greater connection between cryptocurrency and e-sports. Avoiding platform issues/ fees by making competition prize payouts directly in DCR seems like a fine idea. Whether the exposure DCR gets would be worth the cost to the Treasury I'm not so sure.\n\nThere appears to be a [deCRED twitch channel](https://m.twitch.tv/decred/profile) but it has no videos, I don't know who operates it. I looked at your twitch channel and it seems to be empty, no videos, clips, followers, past or future events. This leads me to question whether the games would be able to attract any significant audience. \n\nAre there established DotA 2 channels that host cash games? Have such games been hosted with cryptocurrency prizes before?\n\nTechnically requested amounts should be specified in USD, as DCR sums for invoices will be calculated on the same [basis](https://docs.decred.org/contributing/contributor-compensation/#billing-and-payments) as the standard contractor rate for that month. You have included DCR and USD equivalents so it's pretty close, just wanted to point out that the amount of DCR you receive if the proposal goes ahead would be based on the USD figure.","signature":"180486c94aa9bb5b33444ff7b17b4e99fe40885ad02e9e87643cab258d520dd91fae353f9ca19a843d329d536e750466557cb8e08181871495ac0ff622d0b702","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"65253a64003c897fb89dfc3c1d2578597aa6ec606b2aa2636dc6888bf69090d68804ffc9ab00c698e3cd3541c4e4c88d3b49c6062a8f9263d248b819d2a09808","timestamp":1571666065,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I will amend the request presently to prioritize the USD amount.\n\nI'm not sure about present implementations of cash games.

I did it on my channel, zebbufund, but now that I look, I think I was dumb enough not to save the video before twitch removed it. Someone hosted a CS:GO tournament with a reward paid in HUSH, as well. I did not participate or view because I'm neither good at the game nor entertained by realistic violence.\n\nI agree with you that it might not be a success or have a great payoff relative to the treasury funds.
