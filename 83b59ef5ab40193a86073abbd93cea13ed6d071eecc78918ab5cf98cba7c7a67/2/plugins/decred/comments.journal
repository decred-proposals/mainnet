However, I have the following questions and comments concerning your proposal:\n\n1. [Criptopedia page](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/): I can see you have BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, XMR already, why is that the case? how are you selecting the cc that you want to be featured in this section? can you share metrics on those pages? would DCR be the first one to pay its way in? can anyone pay its way in? \n2. Sponsored articles: I see you have the tag [\"anunciante\"](https://www.criptonoticias.com/negocios/conoce-mejor-confiable-mezclador-bitcoin-2020/) (advertisement) in some articles and these happen to be similar in length to the \"sponsored content\" articles. What's the difference for each? why then, would you suggest sponsored content? could you be transparent and share with us the costs for a similar article posted under \"sponsored\"?\n3. I understand you are expanding your business and content and want to leverage the treasuries and funds out there, this on itself is something to ponder on... but before doing that, my main concern is your coverage of [sponsored articles](https://www.criptonoticias.com/?s=contenido+patrocinado): at least in the first three pages, no pure currencies are featured, you mostly showcase random projects. This might be the nature of things, but unfortunately I don't think it would sit well for Decred to be in that mix. \n\nLooking forward to your answers and comments.","signature":"dbf4f2c3171e7c4391b256ae5f88875b6801a3ba8902c8a62e7a74a53a600c613d925babb095b1c3530123820bcf0d83899d7a0eae7d8ca9633c1712543ca107","publickey":"91e69dad1126c7258e90dda0427aa105ee682bd3149466b75899f6c969278619","commentid":"7","receipt":"5272637564c6cdaedc6bbe9b087561c33d0d99365b670ff48004bc4b762d6b1d22ee7bed197e8e07f47b967e085dbdc264848028bc83d6aebe66c79963f90b08","timestamp":1586814362,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
