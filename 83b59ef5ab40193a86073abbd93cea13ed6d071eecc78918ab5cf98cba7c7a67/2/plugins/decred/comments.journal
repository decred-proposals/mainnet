However, I have the following questions and comments concerning your proposal:\n\n1. [Criptopedia page](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/): I can see you have BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, XMR already, why is that the case? how are you selecting the cc that you want to be featured in this section? can you share metrics on those pages? would DCR be the first one to pay its way in? can anyone pay its way in? \n2. Sponsored articles: I see you have the tag [\"anunciante\"](https://www.criptonoticias.com/negocios/conoce-mejor-confiable-mezclador-bitcoin-2020/) (advertisement) in some articles and these happen to be similar in length to the \"sponsored content\" articles. What's the difference for each? why then, would you suggest sponsored content? could you be transparent and share with us the costs for a similar article posted under \"sponsored\"?\n3. I understand you are expanding your business and content and want to leverage the treasuries and funds out there, this on itself is something to ponder on... but before doing that, my main concern is your coverage of [sponsored articles](https://www.criptonoticias.com/?s=contenido+patrocinado): at least in the first three pages, no pure currencies are featured, you mostly showcase random projects. This might be the nature of things, but unfortunately I don't think it would sit well for Decred to be in that mix. \n\nLooking forward to your answers and comments.","signature":"dbf4f2c3171e7c4391b256ae5f88875b6801a3ba8902c8a62e7a74a53a600c613d925babb095b1c3530123820bcf0d83899d7a0eae7d8ca9633c1712543ca107","publickey":"91e69dad1126c7258e90dda0427aa105ee682bd3149466b75899f6c969278619","commentid":"7","receipt":"5272637564c6cdaedc6bbe9b087561c33d0d99365b670ff48004bc4b762d6b1d22ee7bed197e8e07f47b967e085dbdc264848028bc83d6aebe66c79963f90b08","timestamp":1586814362,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here I go:\n\n1.  We create Criptopedia pages based on, first, what people is looking for on search engines like Google, second, which topic we find interesting (in pages about cryptocurrencies we think about what differentiate each of them from the others and how the community they have revolves around them).\n\nAs for the metrics, unfortunately the only cryptocurrencies with good numbers are Bitcoin (+3000 pageviews in March) and Ethereum (+1000 pageviews), others are around 200 pageviews per month; this may be happening for two reasons: these are the two most popular cryptocurrencies, and both pages are featured/linked on several pages within our website.\n\nRegarding payment, Decred won't be the first one to pay for a Criptopedia page. RSK is already there, you can [check it out here](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/rsk-plataforma-contratos-inteligentes-bitcoin-blockchain/). And if anyone can pay its way in, the answer is no, we select the projects we work with and not the other way around.\n\n2. The difference is advertisement talks about and sells a product/service, while sponsored content talks about general knowledge that might have something to do with the brand sponsoring it, but doesn't sell anything. I suggest this type of content for Decred because it's what I think people would like/need to read in order to understand about this cryptocurrency and decide if they want to use it. As for the cost, it is the same we give our clients through our media kit (you can verify this by contacting publicidad@criptonoticias.com and asking for it).\n\n3. About our coverage, the link you published is a search of the words \"contenido+patrocinado\" (sponsored+content), so the results are showing you every post that has those words in it. You can see our specific coverage for Sponsored Content under the tag [Contenido Patrocinado](https://www.criptonoticias.com/etiquetas/contenido-patrocinado/). In regard to the pure cryptocurrencies' thing, I think we can make some improvements there to feature some articles/topics that we think would interest our audience.\n\nAbout the expansion, we do want to cover other cryptocurrencies/topics we find interesting, like Decred, but without the money to do so it leaves us with the decision of choosing to cover one topic or another, and we don't want to do that. So, we think treasuries give an opportunity to do it without disrupting the normal operation, i.e., to add, instead of exchange, topics.","signature":"3d86b0a0dfeaa64e9df93ebecd8aebcc0989c0b9f8f80c1f28669a5a6dadd35459bb555a953d24100afa74d1e9257e3ffe77b1cdd0539f2623e7507eaf140e04","publickey":"1fff82a5bb4a5c60d169e873a5f1be40c9a129b58471d062c9a15c151bb383e9","commentid":"8","receipt":"e09aca1e99ce175d273a14878899126e66ca57727f5bb8f75bc26ecb01ca2da032cc73fab98d4703b86c781de008c339ae89844a000b34a9bf20e8591955b805","timestamp":1586997680,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
