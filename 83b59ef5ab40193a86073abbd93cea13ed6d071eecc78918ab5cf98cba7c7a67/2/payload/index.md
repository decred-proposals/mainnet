Decred Content Marketing with CriptoNoticias

** What?**

This proposal aims to develop knowledge and brand awareness about Decred within the Spanish-speaking crypto-audience, pushing its level of adoption with the creation, publishing and promotion of educational and practical content in CriptoNoticias website and its social networks. 

**Why?**

Latin America has become one of the most attractive blockchain and cryptocurrencies markets in the whole world, as Decred community well knows, with great levels of adoption as payment method, international transfers, p2p remittances to family and friends from exiled citizens, even as savings technology, and clearly as an industry to do businesses around. That’s why several big crypto companies have come or snatched talent from this region. 

By doing this investment, the Decred community will perceive a long-lasting increase of Spanish users due to the publication of evergreen content in a highly visited and respected crypto-news outlet, such as CriptoNoticias 

People with common questions about Decred (like where to buy/sell it or how to stake/vote) will easily find a good answer to their Google/Youtube (or its favourite search engine) searches thanks to our effort and experience creating high quality, SEO optimized and specialized crypto-content. These people, after reading and learning, will probably turn into Decred users and, if they are users already, will most likely deepen their knowledge and affinity towards the project. 

Furthermore, thanks to the reach of our organically active social networks, interested people will be able to see our messages in every platform and, if they like it, comment and share with their followers increasing the total reach. 

We invite the node operators to don’t take our word for it and go check for themselves what we’re saying. 

**How?** 

This proposal funds the creation, publication and marketing through our social media of educational articles about the Decred project, its blockchain and cryptocurrency. We plan to elaborate 4 of the following contents, with one being a written and video tutorial and other a Criptopedia page: 

- Criptopedia: What is Decred? 
- Tutorial Decred Wallet: learning to manage and benefit from your own node 
- Tutorial Decred staking: earning passive income while securing the network 
- Staking in Decred, is it worth it? 
- The 5 best wallets to hold and use Decred cryptocurrency 
- Where to buy Decred in Latin America and Spain 
- Decred governance system Politeia: what is it, how to use it 
- The best pools to mine Decred 

We’re also open to content proposals from the community. 

Additionally, we propose the creation of a user called “Decred” within our platform, so articles are published by this name and not “Sponsor”. This will add to brand recognition and help visitors find these and future sponsored pieces within one place in CriptoNoticias. By doing this, we can also place a little description of Decred, as well as permanent links to its social networks (like this: https://www.criptonoticias.com/author/redaccion/). 

This page can be the ground for future improvements, like adding a widget with the price/volume of Decred, useful links within decred.org or upcoming Decred events. 

**Who?** 

CriptoNoticias is a digital news site for Spanish-speaking audience which covers the most relevant events related to the Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies technologies. We offer our audience the latest news and trends related to these topics, along with the best analysis and opinion pieces and educational content about these technologies that promise to completely digitize our society. 

CriptoNoticias was born on April 2015 due to the need to have a reliable source of information in Spanish about Bitcoin technology for the Spanish-speaking population around the world. Since then, it has positioned itself as the reference medium within the crypto world, attracting thousands of consumers every month to its many forms of media (articles, videos and podcasts). We have a professional team of journalists and copywriters with over 20 years of experience in the content industry. 

CriptoNoticias’ reach and penetration in the Spanish-speaking regions has also been consolidated and currently has an important **niche audience** of around 400.000 monthly users coming from the countries with the highest adoption of cryptocurrencies: **Venezuela (20%), Colombia (19%), Spain (18%), México (10%), Argentina (8%), Chile (5%)** and the Hispanic community in the United States (4%).

Furthermore, CriptoNoticias' social media accounts have shown vigorous organic growth over the years, being #1 in followers and interactions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CriptoNoticias), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CriptoNoticias/) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/criptonoticias) of all the crypto-news sites in Spanish.

**Why CriptoNoticias?** 

Solid, earned reputation. Since 2015, CriptoNoticias has set the standard for crypto-news in the Spanish language by putting quality above everything else. This is true to the point that the name of our brand is now a SEO keyword which other media outlets use to try to rank their websites within the Spanish crypto-community (You can check Google search and verify this for yourself). 

CriptoNoticias’ work is known for being thorough and devoted to the truth. We strive to find what’s really happening and don’t let any company’s agenda move ours; our readers have even said within social communities that they “won’t believe it until is published on CriptoNoticias”. Our scoop and coverage of the Venezuelan Petro, the BitInka case and the Dash merchants in Venezuela case are some of our works that have earned us great reputation. 

We’re also known and respected for our interviews to top crypto leaders like Andreas Antonopoulos, Jameson Loop, Jimmy Song, Zooko Wilcox, Andreas Antonopoulos or even Max Keiser. As well as regional leaders like Franco Amati, Alex Preukschat, among several others.

CriptoNoticias has covered dozens of crypto-related events, from regional focus ones like LaBitconf (2017, 2018, 2019) and Blockchain Summit Latam (2018, 2019), to international ones like Zconf (0, 1), EthCC, TNABC (2018, 2019), Paralelni Polis (2019), Lightning Conference (2019), Baltic HoneyBadger (2019), Consensus Invest (2018), among others. 

Here’s an example of our vast coverage to events like LaBitConf: https://www.criptonoticias.com/?s=labitconf 

Besides reporting, we’re known for teaching newcomers (and even experienced crypto users) about Bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies via our education section, called “Criptopedia”. In this section, we create high quality, everlasting content to explain the basics (and not so basic) things about these technologies. 

Here are a few examples of our Criptopedia pages: 

- [Glossary](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/glosario/)  
- [Technical dictionary](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/glosario/acronimos-frases/)
- [What is Bitcoin?](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/que-es-bitcoin-btc/)
- [Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/quien-es-satoshi-nakamoto-creador-bitcoin/)
- [Our whole new section on Cryptocurrencies](https://www.criptonoticias.com/criptopedia/criptomonedas/)

**Budget** 

The total budget for this proposal is 5.900 USD, divided this way: 2.000 USD Criptopedia Page, 1.500 USD tutorial + video and 2.400 USD for 2 SEO articles. This will be executed within 45 days, after approved. We’ll publish the 4 chosen articles and the video within this time frame, with at least one week between each other, to give time for proper diffusion and reactions. 

In order to advance with this job, we'll need payments to be made for each article after publication. This can cover creation expenses (research, writing, recording, editing, etc).

As for reporting, we’ll add links for the published content as soon as we have them. 

**Additional details of the proposal**

All the content will be published as Sponsored Articles (Contenido Patrocinado, in Spanish), meaning that articles/videos will have a little tag and text explaining this to our audience at the beginning of the content: “Sponsored content by Decred Politea”.
