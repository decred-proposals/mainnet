I started thinking why I have such impression and [at the moment] I came to conclusion that I feel like the value on Twitter for me is that I like to like \u0026 retweet tweets associated with concrete people.\n\nSaying that, I never engage much with profiles which are automatic aggregators of news. Rather, I support opinions and messages of specific people. I'm not necessarily interested in a simple news/link/stats in the tweet, rather I'm [or I'm not] identifying myself with the opinion of specific person with such news/link/stats.\n\nI would be interested to know how other people feel about this.","signature":"c0a31465edd7eaec3f33aca34c53d737eb1cc1e04ac26820edecfe46ac7ddda3ea04ea5481a9bca0fa9e15e09ca30a8a3bc7ce576274df619d1651975fb3ef05","publickey":"c2d89d336f0d1364a5a63bf4b098e5265ada0782ae787f9cdc2ef66abb082e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"69cea2284030ef09063274cf60824e67dc0e3d7f00ee236989dab2d53b8cbc8f74781c488c654ff42ddaa2711520c742521917dbaf98870e4e8fb7f536704605","timestamp":1585260698,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
