Rather, I support opinions and messages of specific people.

I think our weakness is attracting new people and not when it comes to keeping our existing investors. Why am I saying this? Because I think the work you have been doing (much appreciated btw) is geared towards keeping existing holders updated. I'm not sure many not involved with the project are going to be inspired to click on your updates (just my opinion). With that said, a need that I see that can possibly be addressed (I've had a lot of success doing this with another project) is reaching out on twitter to people that may be receptive to learning about Decred (find receptive people by searching twitter \"money printing\", \"centralized exchanges\" \"inflation\"). Typically people that are discussing these topics are tired of the old ways and are open to new ideas (Decred). Just wanted to give an example of another way of using twitter for daily initiatives to bring in new investors.
