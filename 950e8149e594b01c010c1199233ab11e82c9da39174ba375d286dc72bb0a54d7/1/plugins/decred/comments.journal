Frankly speaking, i have not heard of your exchange before, but from a very brief glance and short look up on google, it does seems that your exchange is as legit as it can be, and has been around for 5-6 years awith  a healthy amount of users base on the active users in the \"trollbox\". How many of those of those are legit however, remain in question.\n\nI am however, very intrigued by your proposal because you are the first to offer a basket of lesser common currencies pairing, namely RUB like you mentioned. \n\nMy qeuestion:\n\n1. Have you had any breach in security of your exchange in the past 5 years of operation? (regardless of minor or a major one). Please be honest.\n2. I see that you offer up to 6 different currencies pairing in your exchange, so in the case of decred, why stop at 2? Are you able to make all 6 fiat pairing available on the outset? \n3. Is your $20,000 budget a one time fee to cover all deliverable, namely future maintenance/tech support, or will there be an ongoing charges?\n4. Could you elaborate more on the CryptoDealers side of deal? What kind of marketing events, how long will the promotional activities will last?\n5. From what i understand, if this proposal goes through, all it takes is 5 working days from start to finish and open for traders to start trading. Is that right?\n6. If successfully implemented, will there be any plan for promotional activities on your exchange (i.e: zero fee trading, competition with rewards given based on trading volume, etc etc) to encourage the initial take-up rate? If so, will this be part of this proposal budget?\n\nThat's all i can think of at the moment. =)","signature":"92454052b7cac9088c6999ee596a7403de774ad6ae3db4deb33a66f77dafcfec4e30b817872aa810d4e42a23fefdd5fb7880c678ffd1610e7319b78ed306bf03","publickey":"88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1","commentid":"1","receipt":"7cf0010c3476c8ec4e4e2a9422e4da6b6f79c4643f83767b23108b8d2a6fc40d9d31a38d1c8c9c707ce149ac0b29812f471a249b1bf3e91e8bd52b6782698103","timestamp":1554223703,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
