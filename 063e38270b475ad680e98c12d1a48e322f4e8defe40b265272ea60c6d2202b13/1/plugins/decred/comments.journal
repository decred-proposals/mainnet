Though I'm not a fan of FB, I greatly appreciate that he is willing to spend time on this platform, as I believe it represents a large segment of people that Decred is not currently targeting. I'm generally against spending money on advertising, particularly when it involves giving money to FB, but I'm open to community input on that.

I'm happy to remove the room for ad spending in this proposal if others share that concern. I can definitely appreciate the reluctance for ad spending, but it can boost the number of people we reach outside of organic growth to a point to be worth the cost. This would be cap, so if it appeared to be ineffective, I would not continue to engage in it. Keeping it in would allow me to analyze which types of posts receive the most engagement outside of existing followers. But again, I'm not married to this. Thanks for your thoughts.","signature":"c350ac98ff3895d3bb4b7116eb196d34e08d33f92797208e3ad5fedc39940cafd18cce231a6c858621151d75916283aabe53ffb24a3c0d7d1630d68ed5a7b60e","publickey":"cc0f0a8bf403d8516049d9764e49fac0cf10ce3019eac27fd980ff4ba4d582c9","commentid":"4","receipt":"9334046a89b91fa847f0817c196202e91875e2461b657b6602ead2634f349da88b0a9219ca7f6966c0662e94ee8c16535b836e1114705ad78f2a04a77335d805","timestamp":1579317918,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
