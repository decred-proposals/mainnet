Facebook Manager and Events Individual Contractor Budget

## Summary

The goal of this proposal is to gauge sentiment and formally request approval from the community for continued billing for my position as a part-time contractor with the project in my pre-Politeia established capacity, working with Facebook. The budget would be for my work with the decredproject [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/decredproject/), participation in social media engagements and marketing efforts, and for participation at events representing Decred in my local area, DFW Texas, as well as opportunities outside my local area within reason.

With the passing of this proposal, in addition to formally receiving confirmation from the community that there is approval for this treasury spending and my continued work, I would also like to bring transparency by sharing a copy of my invoice monthly so stakeholders can see exactly how much time is being billed, and what for to a reasonable level of granularity. I understand skepticism with the value of non-dev work during a bear market, and want to invite criticism and critique in order to determine how to add more value to the project with my time. While I don't believe this itemized approach should be necessary or required, I believe the transparency will be appreciated, and will not be much of an additional burden for my scope of work. This would be something I do until made redundant by the CMS.

## What

### Facebook Management

This has historically involved news releases and posts shared to Facebook in coordination with other contractors who focus on twitter engagement, as well as responding to messages through the platform, and handling spam/scammers as they engage with the page. I work with the intention of maintaining a unified front with the rest of Decred's marketing effort. In addition to _up to_ 10 hours of billable work a week at the standard $30/hr rate, I would like to expand upon what I've done in the past by allowing for room in the budget for $50 a week, $200 a month on ad spends to boost posts and grow the page through small-scale targeted ad campaigns. This would be funded out of pocket up front with re-imbursement through billing included in the monthly invoice. This is not much for ad spending, but will be worth it to get the project's posts in front of the eyes of people who are not already following the page for continued growth, and to determine which type of posts lead to the most engagement outside of those who have already liked the page.

### Cryptocurrency Event Attendance

I adored the time I have been able to spend working with other Decred contractors to discuss the project at events as well as engaging with people on my own locally. I am including this specifically in this proposal as I would like the ability to bill to recoup travel expenses and time spent specifically preparing and presenting the project as I have in the past with stakeholder approval. Invoices with billing in this regard will always include specifics on where and what, and I will record presentations, share created assets, and report on the general sentiment and outcome of these engagements monthly. My goal would be to attend an event representing Decred once monthly if my schedule allows for it, and an event worth attending is happening.

## Why

I know Facebook is a four letter word to some around these parts, but it's a platform filled to the brim with people who haven't bought into the promises of cryptocurrency yet, and a pretty large chunk of people who have but haven't heard enough about Decred. Having active presence(s) on the world's largest and most widely used social media platform is worthwhile.

Working with Decred's marketing and event efforts is something I greatly enjoy, and I want to continue improving upon skills that help me bring value to the project. I believe more grassroots presence at local events is a good thing, and want to see Decred represented more in the DFW, TX area.

## How

I do not possess formal training in marketing, but am passionate about opening eyes to our project and talking about Decred, and possess decent writing skills. I take pride in clean, professional posts that do not besmirch the project. It does not take a genius to operate a Facebook page, but it does take consistent time and effort to stay on top of posting and administration. I know my way around using Facebook's tools for management and targeted advertising. This is not a full-time job for me. I work full-time as a junior Software Developer during the week.

DFW has an active cryptocurrency scene with various groups around the metroplex meeting and inviting representatives of different projects to discuss what their purpose is, and latest developments. I am equipped to deliver these kinds of speeches and presentations, to answer questions ranging from the non-technical to the moderately-technical. I have experience working with the Decred team at events ranging from the Politeia launch party and Texas Bitcoin Conference in Austin, TX to manning the booth at Consensus 2018 in NYC. I am not afraid to get in front of a crowd!

## Who

I'm dezryth, a very passionate stakeholder and contractor of the project I am most passionate about in the cryptocurrency space. You may know me as @decredulous from twitter. I was brought onto the team in October of 2017, helping out with marketing events, marketing verbiage/copy, and management of our Facebook page. I'm very passionate about Decred, and find that the best people capable of promoting something tend to be the ones who can't stop talking about it. I am certainly one of those people.

The motivation for this proposal is due to my hiatus in 2019. My personal life got incredibly busy with a new full-time job change and multiple personal issues. While I still kept an eye on the page, I scaled back my involvement a ton and stopped billing the project for any time I did find to spend on administration. I have not billed against the treasury since December of 2018, shortly after the launch of Politeia, and I feel it is necessary to address our stakeholders using Politeia before continuing any billing. If you do not see value in this, then I have no business continuing to do it.

## How Long, and How Much

This proposal is for a six month contract starting retroactively from the beginning of this year to the end of June with a total budget cap of up to $8400 outlined in the table below. I am all ears to ongoing feedback, and at the end of the contract I will communicate with stakeholders to develop a retrospective before submitting a proposal to seek continued funding.

**Billable Item**|Per Month|Per Six Months
-----|-----|-----
Up to 40 hours a month at $30/hr| $1200| $7200
Up to $200 a month dedicated for ad spends| $200| $1200
Total Cap| $1400| $8400

Thank you for taking the time to read through my proposal. I look forward to addressing your thoughts below.
