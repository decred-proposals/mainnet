The plan all along has been for all contractors to have to go through Pi to get their funding approved. This transfer has progressed slower than some have wanted. There are a couple main reasons IMO:\n\n1) Pi was optimized for stakeholder attention. In practice, this has meant that it has been used mainly for large budgets, such as PR, Marketing, OSS research, etc. The view among \"leadership\" generally is that smaller proposals would waste stakeholder time. \n2) Most contractors' day-to-day work is variable, and not well captured by large budgets. Contractors can work in different areas, pursue new opportunities as they arise (within reason), and may have outside commitments outside the project that limit how far out they can predict their availability. This flexibility is a big reason many contractors work on Decred in the first place, at typically below market rates (Decred gets an amazing deal on labor). It isn't possible for some to say what they'll be doing for six months, and for how many hours. If they did, the difference between a (better paying) job becomes less clear. It's kind of like a (largely) decentralized Uber for knowledge workers. Make them commit 6 months into the future, without the flexibility to pursue other opportunities outside stakeholder approval, and you could see valuable community members demand better compensation or leave the project (more likely). \n\nThere have been discussions for how to make Pi (or alternate platfoms) more amenable to smaller, more granular projects, but these seem to have stalled out. \n\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"543b7c0c3f6b0b1259981234795b185e9dd90172064478ec9b7799601ae962e42c3ad3b7f079814cc93261151a480d1315a6998162a5581d9582d710b4cb080d","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"10","receipt":"55f49a94b53feae02b1849785f6e8296833558532f9ef70fd77e09d8d19d69bf19b30a355d5ccf4245f293ff82f2834c40d323826913f3db81397cb84d9c1d09","timestamp":1579396337,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Marketing contractors including myself help coordinate and propose retweet candidates from the project account.  Original tweets are work-shopped and posted after receiving a go-ahead from a reasonable consensus of contractors. I would say our base is definitely covered on Twitter as far as running the project account goes. I hope this addresses your question! Thank you.","signature":"fa8ed931c0dca6b6a452aa7023a68ac90742497d0af37e032b03a3c7a3a5d97bc2fdf22d6232b78f735833ed39cc21bfab8444bdf8e48bef2cc217fe705e0209","publickey":"cc0f0a8bf403d8516049d9764e49fac0cf10ce3019eac27fd980ff4ba4d582c9","commentid":"11","receipt":"10324fa1e5167223b182dc267b2e639100f0d65805b9af5b7fd93a5bc247f15f3ae4645a42ec68118f032cbe9d7bffe6646d2fe7cc3e45e93492319fd14c2902","timestamp":1579401090,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I have mixed feelings about ads. It's against Decred ethos to track our users, and still we need to get to those potential new users that are still using centralised platforms but that could change their usage if they reflect on other possibilities. But at the same time, using ads could allow us to target our message more efficiently.\n\nA few questions: \n- What organic strategies do you think that could be useful? \n- Do you recon a case where ads can add value? I'm thinking for example during big events like consensus or others in which we want to have a strong presence, just an idea. \n\nWish you all of success!

All marketing will be targeting organic growth through engaging content that highlights the work of our talented contributors.\n\n* I believe we need to go, and be, where potential new users are even if it's not pretty. As far as organic strategies, making posts more engaging by inviting discussion is a great way to lead to new followers as they tag their friends to share their opinion or to \"get a load of this guy\" when someone shares an unpopular viewpoint. There are popular Facebook groups that exist for the sole purpose of discussing cryptocurrencies and answering new user questions and sharing new project developments. I can visit these places and promote our project, capturing interest and leading them to the rabbit hole. \n\n* Facebook will let you pay them to put your posts in front of more eyeballs, but it's expensive and the return on investment is very hard to measure. On top of this, it runs contrary to many values that many stakeholders share to spend any money on their targeted advertising, which would fuel Facebook's continued surveillance capitalism.\n\nThrough my efforts at attending events in meat-space, I can promote all of our outlets for more info on Decred. One is more likely to have a Facebook account in the wild than a twitter, so our Facebook page can act as a catalyst that launches them into exploring our project more as they see latest developments cross their feed; if not at that particular moment, later on.","signature":"8ea4a885a355954d46b444b7f44620776148280c33a52d168b5a25aa05c311f8569fedf3a4731975db3e30853084b935038f8cb0d55cae98fcc5f74843c1bf05","publickey":"cc0f0a8bf403d8516049d9764e49fac0cf10ce3019eac27fd980ff4ba4d582c9","commentid":"17","receipt":"e5d7f9148073a02afd20c824ed53ab5f9d75ca6ed7f2d141d780f3f08d1f203d4a39e5cb49c9803c8ff6d41528109ff9df5694e43fb9069b167860c49629540e","timestamp":1579663578,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Having \"boots on the ground\" promoting Decred at events in this location is definitely something I can get behind.\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"73a6c4567817b58703341c9ea7b7682b05fddb35423c4dad6a3b248f5e95a45a1e09109d4aa77a9dcc2a2a451c56c94a9474437466a95954427237b184205c04","publickey":"988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458","commentid":"18","receipt":"698e72504c5c00140b47b377fc3b2ab310eff460728696acff21b6e7590859f4bce4dac784db4517b78561becb9db4f0936deff67ec62160c4aa08d3dcecd207","timestamp":1579673816,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don't have a horse in the race and I do believe that this role is of value when framed through the points below. \n\n1. It makes complete sense from a project values perspective for Decred to not use treasury funds to pay to advertise Decred on Facebook. \n2. With that decision made, it is worth considering the likelihood of success for the work contained in this proposal in order to:\n  \n- set realistic community expectations for what is achievable without paid media\n- set out a plan that maximises the chance of creating organic sharing of content and therefore an expansion in the awareness of the project. \n\n**A rough history of FB's ad model. \n** \n- Phase 1  - Pages paid to get 'likes' from people who had 'liked' pages a bit like theirs. \n- Phase 2 - Pages had to pay to get content to the people who they had already paid to reach, in order to get those people to hopefully share that content onwards.  \n- Phase 3 - Pages had their reach in the news feed throttled by FB. Instead the ranking algorithm prioritised sharing of content between friends / family etc. \n\nNowadays organic reach is only gained through the actions of a small sample of the original post and these actions determine how far and wide the FB algo will share the content. \n\nSo say Decred has 3000 likes (side point it would be interesting to see the data behind that that growth, assume most in 2017 run up?) then a post without paid media might reach 10% (or less). \n\n- So now up to 30 people who have liked the page have the post in their timelines - not all at once, but staggered through a relatively short window of time.  \n- If the post demonstrates positive engagement (like, comment, share) then a larger sample will  be tested and scaled out\n- This is on a post by post basis. \n- A small amount of 'pass on' equity, based on the relative performance of previous posts can improve the initial sample size of future posts - a compounding reward for consistency of engagement and of posting. \n- The type of content - text, image or video is also weighted. FB prioritises video - it results in higher engagement and there are more ad dollars to be made.  \n\nSo without paid media there are only really two strategies that are available:\n\n1. **Create content that will be shared.** Easy to say, harder to do. Clickbait, riding the news cycle or hyping an announcement works, but this scattergun approach is hard to manage and doesn't build any long term trust in the page, hence why I'm sure many in the community are unsure of FB as a publishing destination. \n2. **Build a publishing network of pages** with adjacent interests and/or values  (e.g. they don't all have to be crypto, it's back to the idea of people who are interested in this, are also interested in that). Then build a consistent publishing schedule and cross-post and tag each other in each page. Over time a spider network grows that can help trigger more organic reach as a collective than could have been if posted alone. This is the basic network collaboration strategy behind every large FB network (and Instagram / YouTube accounts as well). \n\n1 can work without 2, but 2 doesn't work without 1. They work best when developed together. This approach can then kickstart people sharing content more widely with friends - and deliver organic reach. \n\n**In summary:** \n\n- Create engaging original content (that is ideally video) and then distribute that through a consistent and coordinated content plan through a growing network of like-minded pages. \n\nA tool like https://socialbakers.com is the type of thing that would help project manage this and enable collaboration between a large number of contributors, both internal and external. \n\nI don't know if there is an open source alternative. This has been discussed on another thread, but figuring out a tool that could aid individual contractors in their work and simultaneously facilitate collective content creation, management and distribution is key. \n\nGood luck.  \n","signature":"c5740aef95a5c3ab23ad3caf970d9940ca27d0b41dada39b670b60fa5895fab64a66109239b5ac1f6cf17186268bc174b561dd9fb54e68fcdb9f04bae3ca2806","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"19","receipt":"62f587bd0b695afd4703ca9c2dfcc09fa2a76608dc1f2bbedd666115d7d12a8b0b0a0f7c9bc66ab6c1fc2f9e2421e9062a7b53954e59588cc66a35af6eed810c","timestamp":1579732430,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You clearly put a lot of time into your post and I appreciate that. You've provided an interesting strategy to explore. I'm going to consider this. Our page could certainly benefit from the creation of additional pages used to cross post and draw in separate audiences based on content contributors have created and relevant topics followers would find interesting. We have amazing research articles, many ongoing projects with interesting developments to stay on top of, and an existing large Facebook Community group administrated by emiliomann. We have enough content to share at least a few times a week for multiple separate pages. Regardless of whether or not my particular proposal passes, this could be an interesting idea to explore for any contractors that may take over to strengthen the project's brand on Facebook.\n\nI have been careful in this proposal to not make promises about any particular amount of growth because I do not have a great way to forecast how much of an impact I will be able to have with my strategies to increase engagement, more frequent posting, and seeking out new followers in established cryptocurrency groups on the platform. I am not a professional experienced veteran in marketing strategies, but I am interested in trying different approaches and building on what works to see Decred's presence grow. I'm happy to have other community members such as yourself to lean on for feedback and advice.","signature":"10acab74b44055d1cae2b77eedcf15b2f48e484978156d3e31c4d5f91d590e3d849246b4815758083ad7b908d2e63a437c7c8af331d3242a3a874da4407e8a0c","publickey":"cc0f0a8bf403d8516049d9764e49fac0cf10ce3019eac27fd980ff4ba4d582c9","commentid":"20","receipt":"a19f548c290d562406bd2e527227eb46109dc3ffb23e3ef79e0d85931a3df9b1007f58f3e32b853303192429bafc0072a8fb3b3a238352503f7a9b76ac8e5000","timestamp":1579748517,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm not advocating too detailed reports or expenses. There must be a balance between contractor's privacy and reporting burden, and keeping stakeholders informed. But I appreciate that you proactively plan for it.\n- Monthly limit of hours allows us to start small and evaluate results before ramping up FB outreach.\n- The pay is reasonable.\n- Glad to see ad spending removed. Honestly, I would vote to spend $200/month to teach people to block ads.\n- Appreciate the summary of updates at the end.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- I didn't see anyone saying that he learned about Decred via Facebook. Of course my knowledge is limited. How useful was spending resources on Facebook in the past? Did we make any noise or onboard any users/builders? Can you name a few interesting interactions?\n- I suspect that FB users are the least informed in terms of cryptocurrencies and privacy, otherwise they would stop using FB. Is this the case and is it a concern for this proposal?\n- Is there any significant crypto action on FB? Are many crypto projects active on FB?\n- How does FB moderation feel like? What are amounts of spam and scam? Does cleaning up junk take a lot of work?\n- What is the state of censoring crypto content on FB?\n- I noticed an uptick in FB followers somewhere in December (from 3 to 3.2K), do you know the cause? ;)\n- Can you also cover Instagram? I heard it is integrated with FB in a way that makes managing both easier.\n\nIdeas:\n\n- I'd like to see event expenses grouped in bigger event budgets.\n- Map/analyze \"Crypto Facebook\" for the community to make a more informed decision about spending on FB in the future.\n- Get in touch with several followers of our FB page to \"test it\" and learn how much Decred stuff is _really_ shown in people's feeds. FB had years and billions to excel in controlling the spread of information.\n- I like the idea to try and increase our Facebook presence _for now_, but ultimately I'd like to stop feeding that platform _any data_ as soon as we're big enough. For some people that we might want to onboard, the _lack_ of FB presence could be an interesting signal.\n- Participate in FB crypto discussion outside Decred page, i.e on Facebook's r/cryptocurrency if it exists.\n- Try engaging with \"sound money\" communities, if any.\n- Use simplified language to make Decred more accessible for people _still using Facebook_.\n- Use FB's Events feature to post upcoming Decred events around the world.\n- Educate users about Facebook's privacy issues. I would consider it a double win if someone both joins Decred and leaves Facebook.\n","signature":"9e186ea7ca81686c255a01b1b0291e10e42744f168523ff0c79247496337119bb5f44a72ff18eb9c49f816e21af9986694fd8d9d0ed45c49bbcc3e502e871b00","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"24","receipt":"d6a73498ad61c78f57850b2cc5bd8126e43b5a4d34a8aa58dbc1626613f5737b0f66667d0e6bcf63a82429a20440873242cd70c0dfd23d96e922d598b26bb208","timestamp":1579804063,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
