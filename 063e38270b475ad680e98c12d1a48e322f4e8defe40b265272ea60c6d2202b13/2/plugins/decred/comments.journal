The plan all along has been for all contractors to have to go through Pi to get their funding approved. This transfer has progressed slower than some have wanted. There are a couple main reasons IMO:\n\n1) Pi was optimized for stakeholder attention. In practice, this has meant that it has been used mainly for large budgets, such as PR, Marketing, OSS research, etc. The view among \"leadership\" generally is that smaller proposals would waste stakeholder time. \n2) Most contractors' day-to-day work is variable, and not well captured by large budgets. Contractors can work in different areas, pursue new opportunities as they arise (within reason), and may have outside commitments outside the project that limit how far out they can predict their availability. This flexibility is a big reason many contractors work on Decred in the first place, at typically below market rates (Decred gets an amazing deal on labor). It isn't possible for some to say what they'll be doing for six months, and for how many hours. If they did, the difference between a (better paying) job becomes less clear. It's kind of like a (largely) decentralized Uber for knowledge workers. Make them commit 6 months into the future, without the flexibility to pursue other opportunities outside stakeholder approval, and you could see valuable community members demand better compensation or leave the project (more likely). \n\nThere have been discussions for how to make Pi (or alternate platfoms) more amenable to smaller, more granular projects, but these seem to have stalled out. \n\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"543b7c0c3f6b0b1259981234795b185e9dd90172064478ec9b7799601ae962e42c3ad3b7f079814cc93261151a480d1315a6998162a5581d9582d710b4cb080d","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"10","receipt":"55f49a94b53feae02b1849785f6e8296833558532f9ef70fd77e09d8d19d69bf19b30a355d5ccf4245f293ff82f2834c40d323826913f3db81397cb84d9c1d09","timestamp":1579396337,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There are other existing contractors involved in managing and operating the decredproject Twitter page on Matrix: dustorf, jzbz, richard-red to name a few. From my perspective this is considered an ancillary responsibility among larger, more important contractor responsibilities, but that's as far as I can speak to this topic from my experience. Marketing contractors including myself help coordinate and propose retweet candidates from the project account.  Original tweets are work-shopped and posted after receiving a go-ahead from a reasonable consensus of contractors. I would say our base is definitely covered on Twitter as far as running the project account goes. I hope this addresses your question! Thank you.","signature":"fa8ed931c0dca6b6a452aa7023a68ac90742497d0af37e032b03a3c7a3a5d97bc2fdf22d6232b78f735833ed39cc21bfab8444bdf8e48bef2cc217fe705e0209","publickey":"cc0f0a8bf403d8516049d9764e49fac0cf10ce3019eac27fd980ff4ba4d582c9","commentid":"11","receipt":"10324fa1e5167223b182dc267b2e639100f0d65805b9af5b7fd93a5bc247f15f3ae4645a42ec68118f032cbe9d7bffe6646d2fe7cc3e45e93492319fd14c2902","timestamp":1579401090,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I have mixed feelings about ads. It's against Decred ethos to track our users, and still we need to get to those potential new users that are still using centralised platforms but that could change their usage if they reflect on other possibilities. But at the same time, using ads could allow us to target our message more efficiently.\n\nA few questions: \n- What organic strategies do you think that could be useful? \n- Do you recon a case where ads can add value? I'm thinking for example during big events like consensus or others in which we want to have a strong presence, just an idea. \n\nWish you all of success!
