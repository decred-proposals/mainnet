I'm also happy to proceed as a validator, though I feel I haven't provided nearly as much input as the other participants.\n\nI'd like to suggest a few edits to the proposal, to clarify some points to would be vuln reporters:\n\n1. List and make it abundantly clear the payout procedure for disclosures: that to receive payment reporters need to have an account on the CMS (if that's going to be the procedure) and that they will be paid within the standard payment schedule of every other decred project and will be subject to the same limitations of both the current and the upcoming on-chain based  systems (payment in DCR only, USD/DCR conversion rate, payment delays, etc).\n\n2. Inform _when_ payouts are released: whether it's when the _report_ is verified or if it's only after the _patch_ is written and released on a working copy.\n\n3. Whether _all_ comms between reporter and bug bounty team should be encrypted or only the report itself or if it's up to the discretion of the bug bounty team if any encrypted comms are needed.\n\nI'm suggesting these as direct edits to the proposal (vs a simple policy change published in the bug bounty site) so that they are, in a sense, _binding_: Specially for the first one I feel we've had some occasional uncertainty on the payout process (people not relaying their DCR address or wanting to receive on a different schedule). So putting these on the proposal itself makes it clear for both reporters and other Decred stakeholders that the bug bounty team is explicitly **not** going to \"escrow\" (for the lack of a better word) funds for reporters and that they are responsible for engaging with the standard Decred contractor systems for payouts.\n","signature":"c999aec304b16231f63a310a3fe97e49d4caf117927ea56f4a0fd883b8edf4dc0380a846044e7619c95442b1460a270e0fb4f212247b9418a64cef9a83040e03","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"bd7e725f0c95f6c1b5718afc03438bb9f319020fea2d1748dcd32fcf8514dcbec928bec5b0a04476cd6abe9c254c64ec554946c38e0bc6b5ee015ec55240220c","timestamp":1591013736,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Having a separate max payout and breakdown for each domain/app might be too much overhead.

There is no fixed number of hours for each task (Totally depends on the number of submissions and other factors) .

Good questions. \n\nHere are the answers. \n\n\u003e     Are bounty winners mostly one-time or are there any \"resident\" security testers?\n\nIn phase 2 all the payouts were to unique people . Phase 1 has one person get 4 small payouts (This person was the only one to get multiple payouts) . \n\n\u003e    How many submissions failed to encrypt their emails? ;)\n\nSadly not many encrypted emails. But I am glad to say the medium level vulnerabilities that had the higher payouts (3000 USD) had all their emails encrypted. At this point if someone has encrypted their emails that usually indicates a good quality report.  \n\n\u003e   Did you change/optimize the process during the first two phases?\n\nWe moved from an email based payout system to the CMS. Setup standard replies https://github.com/degeri/Decred-Bug-Bounty-Proposal/tree/master/2019/email-templates\n\n\u003e   Did any drama/disputes occur during the first two phases?\n\nWe had a few submitters demanded a payout for duplicate vulnerabilities or sometimes refuse to accept that a vulnerability was a false positive. Usually they are ok once we explain it to them, although we has one person with whome we had to send 10+ back and forth emails.\n\n\u003e     Were there any cases of strong disagreement among validators?\n\nNot had any strong disagreements IIRC.\n\n\u003e     Why does the last status update say 123 submissions were processed and 13 eligible for a payout, while this proposal say 60 total submissions and 4 payouts? Which numbers are real?\n\nThe website takes both phase 1 and phase 2 into account. This proposal only contains the phase 2 stats. \n\n\u003e     Can you please describe submissions that were processed but turned out to be not eligible for a payout? What are most common reasons for not being eligible?\n\nThe most common reasons a submission was rejected. \n\n-  Out of scope issues (Regarding mail server, Non decred sites, retried websites)\n- Duplicate vulnerabilities \n- Non vulnerabilities \n\nJust for fun some \"out there\" reports - \n\n- Your website does not use cloudflare  \n- [Private keys in the dcrd tests](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/542c5e01e70b93996929a3ffa517542d734bc7f6/dcrec/secp256k1/schnorr/threshold_test.go#L106) \n- [Public XML files containing \"sensitive\" information](https://blog.decred.org/authors/jy-p/index.xml)\n\n","signature":"0848ef1d5adfe82cd75bb5d641473337fbb9ff05ca8e297c51a125fad17b91ad0158f89b555eff98a769b83807eaf307910548df95332669f0aeae9bfb97e109","publickey":"d18e6dc2871b96d4e0966f3a5d95acc3c1024b7557b15d24597080e4daa68a66","commentid":"7","receipt":"191998f5d9cc2558d4f47d3e5de3a89caf55000629b36a7602551eda97309925f1bcb2ad5e55f40e969a19f0eb2d0007be72600c35f89a8246f0a72eb45aae0c","timestamp":1591420576,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
