I'm also happy to proceed as a validator, though I feel I haven't provided nearly as much input as the other participants.\n\nI'd like to suggest a few edits to the proposal, to clarify some points to would be vuln reporters:\n\n1. List and make it abundantly clear the payout procedure for disclosures: that to receive payment reporters need to have an account on the CMS (if that's going to be the procedure) and that they will be paid within the standard payment schedule of every other decred project and will be subject to the same limitations of both the current and the upcoming on-chain based  systems (payment in DCR only, USD/DCR conversion rate, payment delays, etc).\n\n2. Inform _when_ payouts are released: whether it's when the _report_ is verified or if it's only after the _patch_ is written and released on a working copy.\n\n3. Whether _all_ comms between reporter and bug bounty team should be encrypted or only the report itself or if it's up to the discretion of the bug bounty team if any encrypted comms are needed.\n\nI'm suggesting these as direct edits to the proposal (vs a simple policy change published in the bug bounty site) so that they are, in a sense, _binding_: Specially for the first one I feel we've had some occasional uncertainty on the payout process (people not relaying their DCR address or wanting to receive on a different schedule). So putting these on the proposal itself makes it clear for both reporters and other Decred stakeholders that the bug bounty team is explicitly **not** going to \"escrow\" (for the lack of a better word) funds for reporters and that they are responsible for engaging with the standard Decred contractor systems for payouts.\n","signature":"c999aec304b16231f63a310a3fe97e49d4caf117927ea56f4a0fd883b8edf4dc0380a846044e7619c95442b1460a270e0fb4f212247b9418a64cef9a83040e03","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"bd7e725f0c95f6c1b5718afc03438bb9f319020fea2d1748dcd32fcf8514dcbec928bec5b0a04476cd6abe9c254c64ec554946c38e0bc6b5ee015ec55240220c","timestamp":1591013736,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
