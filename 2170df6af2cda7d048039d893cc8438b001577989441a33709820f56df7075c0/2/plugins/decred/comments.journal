I'm also happy to proceed as a validator, though I feel I haven't provided nearly as much input as the other participants.\n\nI'd like to suggest a few edits to the proposal, to clarify some points to would be vuln reporters:\n\n1. List and make it abundantly clear the payout procedure for disclosures: that to receive payment reporters need to have an account on the CMS (if that's going to be the procedure) and that they will be paid within the standard payment schedule of every other decred project and will be subject to the same limitations of both the current and the upcoming on-chain based  systems (payment in DCR only, USD/DCR conversion rate, payment delays, etc).\n\n2. Inform _when_ payouts are released: whether it's when the _report_ is verified or if it's only after the _patch_ is written and released on a working copy.\n\n3. Whether _all_ comms between reporter and bug bounty team should be encrypted or only the report itself or if it's up to the discretion of the bug bounty team if any encrypted comms are needed.\n\nI'm suggesting these as direct edits to the proposal (vs a simple policy change published in the bug bounty site) so that they are, in a sense, _binding_: Specially for the first one I feel we've had some occasional uncertainty on the payout process (people not relaying their DCR address or wanting to receive on a different schedule). So putting these on the proposal itself makes it clear for both reporters and other Decred stakeholders that the bug bounty team is explicitly **not** going to \"escrow\" (for the lack of a better word) funds for reporters and that they are responsible for engaging with the standard Decred contractor systems for payouts.\n","signature":"c999aec304b16231f63a310a3fe97e49d4caf117927ea56f4a0fd883b8edf4dc0380a846044e7619c95442b1460a270e0fb4f212247b9418a64cef9a83040e03","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"bd7e725f0c95f6c1b5718afc03438bb9f319020fea2d1748dcd32fcf8514dcbec928bec5b0a04476cd6abe9c254c64ec554946c38e0bc6b5ee015ec55240220c","timestamp":1591013736,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Having a separate max payout and breakdown for each domain/app might be too much overhead.  When we get a vulnerability we run it through https://bounty.decred.org/img/owasp-rating.png with the network in context. \n\n\u003e I really like CVEs(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and think that every security researcher wants to sign one, maybe public the bug in a CVE form to endorse better the participant, not everyone hunting just for money.\n\nAssigning CVE's is a very resource intensive process and it has alot of centralized functions that id rather not get involved in.\n\n\u003e I know that Github is a centralized service, but since we still use their services, I think it would be worth taking advantage of the Github Security Advisory, It seems very useful to manage the vuln reports /patches and they are a CNA(CVE Numbering Authorities ). https://youtu.be/ekHXeRUldE0?t=798\n\nWe can add a SECURITY.md file which redirects to bounty.decred.org if the developers are ok with it. \n\nQuestions: -\n\n\u003e     Can you explain better the hours of works for these values?\n\nThese are billed at the standard contractor rates.  There is no fixed number of hours for each task (Totally depends on the number of submissions and other factors) . This is just the maximum budget for that specific task. \n\n\u003e     What are these numbers for?\n\nPlease see above that.
