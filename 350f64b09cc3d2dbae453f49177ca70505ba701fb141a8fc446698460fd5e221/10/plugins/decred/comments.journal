If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.\n\nIYAM crypto marketers have only *one job*: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. *No other metric counts*.\n\nBased on the lackluster price performance of DCR, it is abundantly clear the ROI of paying anyone to \"market\" Decred in any capacity has been negative. The numerous paid marketing proposals over the years of Decred's history have done absolutely nothing to raise Decred awareness. There are many reasons for this, which I have elaborated on in great detail on Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/u/atweiden\n\nAll crypto marketers paid by this treasury have completely and abjectly failed Decred stakeholders, over and over again. Individuals being paid to manage \"paid marketing results\" in low-impact regions like Latin America should be the *first* to receive the axe.","signature":"82bd0d6326d91addf12c81099e46c700fc4f967ce7b79c691f520f247bfa20167ed3a3c48944c71341a14eba174c4c2130415aa47086ed522a41af36aea5ab06","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"1","receipt":"b8bd4869b3040e43bd06f6ea876063e7996392502cc39728c220619011b0099495bfb5372a7ba80801975cc4812eb424f3d79b98ce3832b6db492e84f8be730d","timestamp":1606870261,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My instinct at this stage is so vote against all marketing proposals that appear 'status quo'. This is not a reflection on the efforts or intentions of those involved, it is indicative of a poor return on investment and low innovation happening in the marketing space. I am not excited by trying the same technique for the same results. Price and community growth is the only metric that marketing can measure against and both have trended down for years. I would like to see people evangelising with new and creative ways, methods for attracting developer talent in particular and getting more bang for our atoms. We need narratives that stick and resonate.\n\nUntil I can be strongly convinced that the proposed marketing strategy is generating appreciable results, I must vote no.","signature":"2541eac1faee8e78ad71e9ebba5fc0110ebc250acf9098a1619abb5b9834dc12eea70beccdac7eb8bf2d777205de2bb92d8131c20444cf00f2842790db3a4809","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"2","receipt":"1fc7f248c7cb49140c2a856807026aa910043a8c2c50e07feb139d051edd0ffce41283cb51b9bb7e48d68fbb9093d13d583f350d7f14c9d2c23be456113c2b06","timestamp":1606906270,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That it will produce a narrative *so provocative* it will tangibly increase the delta between Decred's perceived progress and Bitcoin's perceived progress measured in BTC terms.\n\nCryptocurrency valuation is a battle of narratives. The most obvious symptom of narrative primacy is organic community activity. Conventional marketing of cryptocurrency has little to no impact on narrative primacy or organic community activity: there are no counterexamples. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, \"Paid Marketing Results\" and \"cryptocurrency\" don't belong in the same sentence.\n\n*\"Does it meme?\"*\n\nAfter looking at DCR/BTC price performance, this is the next question to be asked.\n\nIs the narrative of Latino busy bees working on important sounding marketing things sufficient for creating a provocative narrative? Assuming the market doesn't perceive the delta of that narrative to be positive, it isn't going to positively impact DCR/BTC price, and therefore the value to this treasury *of it* is less than 0.\n\nSeeing as the \"dcrlatam\" team has put forth no provocative ideas of their own — they just want to do more of the same which is *obviously worthless* — this is the only possible provocative narrative they could be contributing to: \"Latino busy bees\". Is that a speculative or *developing* provocative narrative? No. Therefore the value to this treasury is less than 0.\n\nThere is just no sugar coating it. They should be fired, as should every other paid marketer of Decred. Currencies are *belief systems*. There are more people on this planet who believe in \"flat earth\" than who believe in Decred. Who has come up with a narrative at least as strong as that?

I must be critical of all proposals at this stage in the market. I am pushing people to innovate and shake things up. I believe we need to expand and get increasingly creative in how we do things on the marketing front, I want to feel inspired by the proposed work and hear about how you intend to expand the pie. Having a scan over your referred report on Github, it seems we have a community of hundreds to just over one thousand members that is proposed to be serviced by $42k worth of DCR. I am not convinced that this is value for money as yet (and I request that you convince me why I am wrong in this opinion or consider tactics/strategies to amplify growth).\n\nRegarding devs, please do not ask me to zoom in, it is your responsibility in this proposal to present such data, objectives and results for me (and others), especially the non spanish speaker stakeholder to assess. The point of Politeia is to inform and make a case to people who have skin in the game but do not have insider knowledge of your workings, especially when outside my native language. It is unreasonable for you to expect me to have insider knowledge of your results.","signature":"6313720060e0e303d50b1ce61eb4a4caa60d2da08561420a4e6500f1313a94b4159e8ed3938ea53c9f056c4896d456721f3ea256121c931b0ea4d98afa70cb00","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"11","receipt":"35effcf8d8a981722237cd041387a53f0470c3d2d7b4e04e4e04dd3b6f5e1460cb6fe8589951d7e7a15942f8b0a6850718ccdb65724fe2db381573c93767f105","timestamp":1606945069,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I am a technically minded old mate and do not know how to attract talent. This is possibly a good question for Raedah who literally does this style of dev team building for devs globally.\n\nWhat I am far more proficient at is building teams and providing guidance big picture on strategy and having trained many people in my field of engineering, I totally understand the balance between dedicating your time in building understanding vs that understanding taking root and inspiring new ideas. I am quite supportive of your idea to create videos (reusable content) and hackathons as this is immediate dev focus, allows self study and gets people inside the codebase. **Create a Decred academy.** Help people get inside the code and roadmap where to start contributing. This is the kind of outreach that will win my support.\n\nThe narrative of Decred employing talented devs, paid in USD value in nations with challenging currency conditions like LATAM, Africa, Asia etc is not only inspirational, but world changing. If you can expand this narrative and make it real, now you are talking about something that has my support.\n\nFocus on attracting devs, Build the narrative. When I am convinced these two goals are the target output, I become more bullish on the proposal.","signature":"c3e56bd7656446dbc92e688896e1b63dc5e2cd52cf9c0ac2bf8a9c0317b683df4f4ac6819ec58dd7da5bfd9f0e8e74e52cf36dd88272268003626c2668a8e50d","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"13","receipt":"c1e8c3fa1afc74d30bd10c84b988da2ecaf661d5308c8c34506f2b11d29f035fc8822cd5264395fa3a1c2e0b345e31dbd0171bb53ed5d75c1ad2e6724e9e6407","timestamp":1606946433,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There's a couple *thousand* people in our world *at most* who control all the BTC. Your job is to make *their BTC* touch *our DCR*.\n\nAsk yourself something: why would the tiny number of humans in control of the overwhelming majority of BTC care about whether an altcoin community is putting on paid marketing events in Latin America?\n\nI can back this up even further and ask *who* the people are who control all the bitcoin. And the answer is a mix of leftist anarchists and ultra-wealthy investors. Make no mistake: these are your \"customers\" who you are marketing to. You are not marketing to Latin America: you are marketing to Latin America *in the hopes* of *signaling* to the couple *thousand* anarchists and investors living in North America, Western Europe and East Asia who *matter* that Decred is worth investing in.\n\nIYAM, it would take nothing short of a South American *Crypto Woodstock* for these people to be arsed enough to care even in the slightest about a \"paid marketing event\" of any sort.

You're right, one of the big issues that I see is that all the work that is done in Decred in Spanish is hardly observed by stakeholders that don't speak Spanish. Having a [Github repository](https://github.com/DecredES/Monthly_reports) with all the reports was a first step, but I recon that reports are not sexy, however reporting has been a priority since the first proposal.   \n\nCompletely agree with you on being creative with marketing, by the way, this proposal doesn't not have the word marketing in it, how can we marketing a product that we cannot measure how is being sold? I recon that outreach and communications is more align with the work we do.  On this regard, I think the [first steps through out 2019 and early 2020](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1) were to gain brand awareness from the professionals and leaders of the industry in Latam. An example of how this resulted is this acknowledgement of recent price action by [Anibal Garrido](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1334317634880479239), a well known and respected crypto trader in Venezuela. We met back in March when [I presented the project in Valencia, Venezuela](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1236079742643773440), you can see him in the front of the picture with a Bitcoin t-shirt. Since then [Anibal has invited us](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1278478260716933120) to talk about [governance](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1279191924835061761), you can spot he is wearing a blue Decred t-shirt that I gave him in Venezuela, later on [we invited him](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1313526622927171585) to talk about Venezuela in [#HablemosDecred](https://youtu.be/xxNFxZJuOwA)).\n\nThe next step in the big strategy for Decred in Spanish is to keep [building a platform of communications](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b67) through Decred_ES, which I arguably is only a few hundreds nearing a thousand people, however this is now recognised as an established brand in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Spanish. I'd argue that other projects have gone the same route after us: [Algorand](https://twitter.com/Algorand_ES), [Avalanche](https://twitter.com/avalanche_esp), [Bisq](https://twitter.com/BisqEs), [Nervos](https://twitter.com/NervosNetworkES), setting the standard? \n\nI'll like to show you the [opinion of a dev](https://imgur.com/a/symKi18) that is participating in the [Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge](url) that portraits what we are aiming at Decred in Spanish: \n\n\u003e \"This is my first hackathon, the experience was incredible, Decred in Spanish community has been helpful and attentive, you were amazing guys. The last hour I almost got a stroke, my video wasn't uploading to Youtube. So many hours of learning, this was a completely new world for me as a dev, thank you so much to everyone!!\"\n\nCan't go much into details because winners selection is this week but the ideas that are coming from this event are really good, furthermore, we are training new devs into the arts of Decred, several of them are interested in continue learning how to contribute to the project development. The Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge gave us [+6 hours of content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHZZTXR_CIhJrZHnf3xgUrF6EdNsuG_Qa) for Youtube, +15,000 views into the [microsite](https://www.talentland.talent-republic.tv/challenge/blockchain-learning-challenge-decred/), 138 registrations and 7 final projects that are connecting to Decred's blockchain. \n\nMuch of our work is to find ways to interact with the Spanish speaking cryptocurrency audience beyond price. We all love when PGU (price goes up) but no one like when PGD (price goes down). My main objetive is to build something that does not rely on PGU but in all the aspects that surround the technology that makes possible for PGU on the first place. The objective of Decred in Spanish is to keep building regardless of PGU or PGD, our content aims to tackle more issues surrounding the industry. Further more, as every other project or coin just want to sell their token to the retail market, having started Decred in Spanish not from the stance of \"buy DCR\" but from \"come and consume our wealth of knowledge\", many doors have open up over time because the space recognise that we sincerely want to share our tech and wealth of knowledge for everyone else to grow with us. \n\nYou're right, even though the Github repo gives a lot of information there are still plenty of data, objectives and insights that could be there to give stakeholders more information to asses the work of Decred in Spanish. There are still plenty of things for reporting that could give better information for stakeholders, I've been working [on it with bee](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/pull/75) and even tho is not explicitly contemplated in the proposal included in it,[ reporting, reporting, reporting](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/tree/master/index). Still plenty to update and take it to the next level that is to link it to social media channels, telegram bots and the Decred in Spanish website (included in this proposal) to track engagement and give insights to stakeholders on what is working and what is not. The reduction of 10% in this proposal from previous translate in no paid sponsorships for the next 6 months, they were useless in comparison to what the Decred Challenge gave us in return. I care to maximise what every atom can bring to the table, to repeat what is working and cut what is not. \n\nThanks  for being part of this conversation.","signature":"d6aba43fbc2a36dc696853eeb7f469f18dfe074845c52e1222e5161269f39c024c9316314a4fd787a0fee70a225fab1f9c9539603ec12719a97bb8548a992607","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"25","receipt":"5f6c93be0e05facd9b06eaa7b8700dc0aac76b62228a4c6f0c174653acfa107e5908f60d5ec01ddd728648a1bcbd02faf6f941550125e3a725622754e4cc5907","timestamp":1607014988,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

After meeting him one to one we settle the ground for continuous collaboration, the articles and press releases of previous proposal that we have publish in Cointelegraph have over 14k views.  \n\nAdding more information to the Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge, adcade has now released the  6 final projects that are going to be evaluated over the next days, please visit [the following Github repository](https://github.com/DecredES/Challenge/blob/main/Final_Projects.md) to know more. I think this is going to inspire you the same way it inspire me. Thanks to adcade for owning the coordination and all necessary to make it happen, just to imagine the work behind here an [image of the communications behind](https://imgur.com/a/vmvOOWI) the challenge.\n\nAnd in regard to the Decred in Spanish, nachito has worked on mockups of how it would look both in [desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/vZdqKU5OgOkGgVf3oMmKeb/dcresp_desktop?node-id=1%3A2) and [mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/zwPbN8BlkD7RORfXBR1CSg/dcresp_mobile?node-id=0%3A1).

They've demonstrated a huge effort in trying to get the word out, unfortunately said content has not gotten the traction one would've hoped given the following, views and engagement numbers. However, I do understand the wider community's apprehensiveness on continued funding for these activities when it seems like the only useful marketing and outreach strategy is for the DCR price to go up, which is really outside of anyone's control.\n\nThat being said, and I have my bias having been born and raised and Venezuela myself, I think it would be a mistake to completely drop our efforts in the region. There is a huge opportunity in Latin America for Decred to have a meaningful impact throughout this upcoming market cycle, not quite as a store of value or medium of exchange, but as a decentralized autonomous organisation than can hire engineering talent from anywhere in the world, pushing the envelope by fostering the development of open source technology for the benefit of the wider ecosystem with no strings or rent-seeking attached. This isn't about being a charity or some SJW nonsense, necessity is the mother of invention, and I think efforts like the [Locha Mesh](https://locha.io/) are a great example of this.\n\nThe Decred stack has grown quite a lot over the past few years: decrediton, dcrtime, politea, mobile apps, lightning network, dcrdex, it truly is the Swiss army knife of crypto. IMHO the challenge is now to scale and gain developer and engineering mind-share, probably the scarcest resource in the space, to get people not just using Decred, but building on it.\n\nLightning Network may be a great platform to do this, and Decred's user on-boarding is considerably easier than Bitcoin's - the toughest part is to buy DCR.\n\nI really haven't been following the ongoing hackathon, but I do think this these sort of efforts are a step in the right direction and would like to see the proposal geared more towards attracting talent.","signature":"59c07cc91a5986bf2f147cc434aacc02e1444665aa8ce2e95fb7311c72c52c0990054097b2dc6869c25b82097efbe8eb8ae6b9f9e1f2c1709cda6052bfba6e07","publickey":"e5507f79c3df82af9845225deaf9ffc60f2abb0ab8cceaa77b48b8f64d3b2976","commentid":"27","receipt":"09a015368ba437b0ead79440d4ca363ae42690bc68ac352efffd8768ec90d408d7712052536c23e81b06b836d79759159f495eea03530248b0ca9f9f12e7440b","timestamp":1607078694,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I have never had interest in social justice, it has no appeal to me and was never the undertone, that is your misinformed read.

On the contrary, sometimes people tell us that Decred is more democratic, we are careful to note that is not, is open and accesible but voting power comes from skin in the game, not from a democratic redistribution of wealth or anything like it. Critics like atweiden think that we are creating a narrative of distributing wealth and social justice, comparing the treasury to some sort of [socialist entity](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jxum72/activities_report_5_decred_in_spanish_proposal_2/) giving away free money. The Treasury isn't giving free money, rewards people reputation and prior work. \n\nI do think that the nature of Decred allows for anyone to receive compensation for their work regardless of their location or monetary national situation. On this regard, we do talk about the power of Decred DAO in employing anyone from anywhere. And our team is a good probe of this, as you mention before, building teams is quite an endeavour and Decred in Spanish team now extends over three countries in Latam: Mexico, Colombia and Argentina (headhunting in Venezuela). On this regards I feel super proud of the team that I have build over the past two years, why? Because I build something bigger than myself, if I were to leave the project tomorrow, Decred in Spanish would continue working and creating content because is set as an organisation that can work on its own. I agree with you that being able to have a global workforce regardless of national constrains is powerful and revolutionary. \n\nissedjur asked below that of great value have you given to the project? The answer is a team of passionate people that understand Decred vision of the world and are professionally capable of working within the project for its perpetuation. Decred in Spanish is the result, as of today the teams has weekly calls every Monday since June, hundreds of messages for coordination of activities in four different Telegram channels. As with the image I send you before of the thread of emails behind the Decred Challenge, there is a ton of work that is not visible (and boring) but is the key to build what we have build. Be certain that by my self I couldn't have made a third of what we have done so far. Decred in Spanish is after all an international team in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina of cryptocurrency professionals building Decred ecosystem in Spanish. \n\nBest!","signature":"8b182ade5331914942ec73a9d8d5318653f0bbe443fdcd161d6444347b9b4b933889297624a3dad0b65b33046d1055b9b3c6e9ad1605cc988befdd5bd0f9a10e","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"29","receipt":"881edb598dda4394725d72c2118ba48bdd9a436287c1ef1a888d149d1a4c3e266cfd5045fc250c57a6f6a0b23ade546d616c1084a6daefe14a7785e69a65d70b","timestamp":1607099354,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

However, I can say with certainty that this proposal will increase the Spanish speaking eyes looking at Decred. You can see in the [Github report](url) that engagement numbers are growing, not as I would like of course but again we are selling a hyper volatile and scarce asset, at the end of the day what drives people is NGU or quality content for the audience. I cannot promise NGU but I can plan for the next 6 months of Spanish content for people to pay attention when NGU. A few comments below you'll see a comment from bochinchero, when he joined in 2018 there was zero Spanish content, and this is something that I believe is overlook. atweiden questioned on Reddit if Decred in Spanish would have born organically without investing money on people, I think not. Treasury investing in people is what resulted in Decred in Spanish. \n\nThe more the project invest in building the ecosystem the more engagement, curiosity and activity will happen in the community and the network. Just a few weeks ago we receive a couple of messages in Decred in Spanish Telegram channel from Spanish users that bought DCR with their pension fund, they were quite scared because at that time DCR was rosing 11 USD, I really hope they hodl but is hard to know. I don't know where they learned about Decred but they share they bought in the Decred in Spanish telegram channel, my conclusion is that there is a direct correlation between Decred regional investment and community activity. Investing in regional efforts is investing in the more broad global effort to increase brand awareness of Decred. \n\nWhy Decred in China hasn't grow?","signature":"c535fda82e8c9b898c88ac8e6106487c9daf60de2e8c950ba0dccb4ea291042bf85c99c600ead2bfd5b6abd5d62a57f69a54365e89db00b0369b238dc4908500","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"30","receipt":"dd2056bc6d30adbf889ad6c9f4ce239d858a15daae4a7ee8b26027d2a1907f7f62b9484fc8e2e5dffe2e61d042e5226f9f1baa854697111d60000c840c8c170e","timestamp":1607101902,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As of today, Decred in Spanish employs 7 cryptocurrency professionals from Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. Furthermore, Decred in Spanish team coordination is such that if tomorrow I would leave the project, Decred in Spanish would continue working and creating content. What we have done over the past 6 months would have been possible only as a team effort. \n\nGreat question, I think I am but I am biased to answer, [a previous contractor thought I was the right fit](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1cd325be6be39109c2750f34095c4e8feeea962ede058a1e4f4a61473e/comments/9) mentioning the following:\n\n\u003e Elian has demonstrated incredible initiative, witnessed by his list of events, translations, interviews, and most vitally, the team he has attracted and assembled to carry out his plan. He made great use of the Events and Marketing proposals, and I think he has earned the trust of the community to continue leading outreach in Mexico and Latin America. He has demonstrated all the traits required of an area lead: mastery of the crypto ecosystem and all things Decred, organizing local meetups, organizing larger scale events, generating content, spearheading partnerships, gaining media attention and doing interviews, recruiting new team members, managing various communications platforms, and sharing information across the Decred network. I believe he is a valuable contributor to the growth of Decred, and I hope he and his team are able to continue their good work. \n\nYes, my general objective for growth is 80% in all the social media channels of Decred in Spanish. In aggregate, Decred in Spanish socia media channels grew by 142% if we consider the YouTube channel which had a 650% grow. If we discount YouTube, our growth was around  35% in the rest of social media channels. As you can see setting the bar at 80% is quite high, I think we will be able to achieve this goal over the next 6 months. \n\nI agree with you that when analysed in detail numbers are still low but please bare in mind that this grow has been organic and that we are not selling candies here, it is hard to sell a super scarce hyper volatile asset that has swing from 40USD, when I started collaborating in the project, to 40USD again a few days ago. We need to be careful of our narrative because we don't want people to buy Decred thinking they're going to be rich to find themselves in a situation where this may not be the case. This is why our approach is to stay away from price talk as much as possible, we are showing that Decred is much more than a hyper volatile asset, rather is also a global community of engineers and entrepreneurs building a common enterprise with cutting edge technology. Our approach is to build a wealth of knowledge that attracts people beyond the conversation of number goes up.\n\nWe have a plan and work flows necessary to deliver quality content, to push this content and to keep building bridges with the rest of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nImagine Decred is an island that the more spends isolated from the rest of the world, the faster may become irrelevant. We have the best tech in the space, I truly believe this, but it is worthless if no one knows about it. This is our work, to get the word out. We could do it faster with advertisement but we align to Decred's ethos of not using corporate surveillance systems to target our potential users. This is why organic growth takes time, it is not easy and tends to chaos.\n\nThanks again for your comments and your critical approach to our proposal","signature":"11e6ddf1389210d134eb86c0997606c4abf6f5dae9ae6870ab15ba5d21d8f6bf0eb5f18f08737d0313c6830142415040503a6dfe62086f7056a963318032570f","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"32","receipt":"5e0e24637147dac60cbed018c0ea669028e84f5605adc659ff49bd7342774fd79a716ab5932fe11413bb2e7dee0b65b43dfb652ad1de6ca7b07ab20f7f48340e","timestamp":1607106540,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I recon that we are working on the right track of creating content and driving engagement but there is still space to get creative, break some plates and get more exposure. I am constantly looking for what drives engagement. Be asure that we are contantly looking for new ways to create interest in the project. \n\nThe [Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge](https://www.talentland.talent-republic.tv/challenge/blockchain-learning-challenge-decred/) has been an excellent opportunity to connect with Devs and give them the tools for them to eventually collaborate with the project.  Here some details about the challenge: [+6 hours of content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHZZTXR_CIhJrZHnf3xgUrF6EdNsuG_Qa) for Youtube, +15,000 views into [the microsite](https://www.talentland.talent-republic.tv/challenge/blockchain-learning-challenge-decred/), 138 registrations and [6 final projects](https://github.com/DecredES/Challenge/blob/main/Final_Projects.md) that are connecting to Decred's blockchain for their projects. Several of the Devs that are participating are now looking forward for more information to collaborate with Decred as software contractors. One good example of this interest is the [following comment](https://imgur.com/a/symKi18) from one of the participants. Moreover, the work behind this Challenge is massive and unfortunately is mostly overlooked, here an [email thread behind](https://imgur.com/a/vmvOOWI) the coordination of the event. \n\nThe objective is that these project will work as a reputation letter for them to present their work to Decred's global community and from there they could go deeper into collaborating on the projects needs. As you mention, Decred tech stack has several sub.projects to develop, from lightning to Politeia passing through dcrtime, Decred in Spanish is setting the pace  for headhunting new Devs for the project. \n\nThe Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge has outperformed other strategies for engagement in Decred in Spanish This is why we are planning to organise two Challenges for the next proposal. \n\nPlease let us know any further comments.

It would be a big mistake to reduce their work and long term efforts to wanted marketing spend. Decred needs use cases to validate its existence and value beyond being an alternative to Bitcoin.   Technical innovation, solid code, privacy, even a DEX are all important  tools.   Great tools alone don't mean a lick if no one is using it or if it only appeals to a few 100 people who can actually use CLI interfaces and care to download proprietary wallets etc. \n\nEngaging real users and understanding the problems they need solved is imperative, its starts with outreach awareness which needs to be sustained over long period of ti me. Questioning the value returned for an $18k budget for a team with proven dedication and output is laughable, particularly when it comes from folks who have been around for much less time, and contribute only critiques with no constructive suggestions or counter ideas/proposals. \n\nIf you are into team building, name a better team working on getting the word out on Decred with coverage of a very strategic region of the world with the problems crypto is perfectly suited to solve?\n\nThis nickle and dimming, and arm chair quarterbacking needs to be reassessed.  A $ 3k run rate for a stand out team is less than what [Monde PR ](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c81926b )is being paid for a 1 year commitment, I did not see so much contention around that proposal.  And no offense, the LATAM teams output is an order of magnitude bigger and of more long term value.  This is a team that has proven themselves and covers a region, proposing work at a discount to a one person operation whose value was barely questioned with this level of rigor.\n\nPerhaps the LATAM team does not toot their own horn loud enough so I will do it for them.  I am appalled at the level of questioning and critical nature of the conversation questioning the value of the contribution of Elian and his team.  \n\nWe are far off the mark on this one.

It would be a big mistake to reduce their work and long term efforts to wanted marketing spend.\n\nCitation needed.\n\nJust because a team of paid individuals is putting out videos and putting on (paid) marketing events, doesn't mean those activities are worthwhile. Where are the results? Show me how it's any different from paying people to dig holes.\n\n\u003e Decred needs use cases to validate its existence and value beyond being an alternative to Bitcoin.\n\nUse cases don't bootstrap cryptocurrencies, narratives do. Bitcoin is a global currency of fixed supply controlled by computer algorithms. This challenges the mainstream theory of economics, by design. To the extent the BTC market price is greater than $0.00 USD, the signal is amplified that we should question the mainstream narrative. Hence, Bitcoin psychologically anchors mainstream narrative dejection to a scarce exchangeable asset.\n\nDecred doesn't have that, and no amount of throwing paid marketing events will change that fact. Which is why all Decred marketing historically has completely failed to produce any results whatsoever. Which is why \"dcrlatam\" — and every other paid marketer of Decred — should be fired.\n\nI've shared many different approaches for anchoring the price of DCR with mainstream narrative dejection. It comes down to pushing peer reviewed academic papers which cast doubt on the sacred cows of modern day science, including but not limited to the Big Bang theory, and Darwin's theory of a common ancestor. Other extremely ferocious narratives can come of that, and I'm sure many here could suggest still more approaches in the same light. Paying select people to \"handle marketing\" just puts the onus on them to do it all, and they've repeatedly failed to suggest anything provocative.\n\n\u003e Great tools alone don't mean a lick if no one is using it or if it only appeals to a few 100 people who can actually use CLI interfaces and care to download proprietary wallets etc.\n\nThe Gini coefficient of Bitcoin is so staggeringly nightmareish, that there is more potential value to unlock for Decred in the average Bitcoin OG's *pinky finger* than the entire population of Latin America put together. Some of that may be slightly exaggerated, but the general point is sound: *of course* we should cater to our highest value customers. No, they *don't* live in Latin America.\n\n\u003e A $ 3k run rate for a stand out team is less than what Monde PR is being paid for a 1 year commitment, I did not see so much contention around that proposal\n\nThis is sheer whataboutism. Monde PR should obviously be fired as well. What we need to do is tie mainstream narrative dejection to DCR ownership in a way which diverges meaningful from what Bitcoin is doing. At that point, we — same as Bitcoin and Ethereum — will receive PR without lifting a finger.\n\nThat is the goal.","signature":"238c2a1567e5bbe4e360de21405e67ff020d58a35e563aeced4ecb2316e9135fa066d53a2ffd39079653b0e268627e1cf73f1dfcc660713324e34a76605f4d0c","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"47","receipt":"a071d57929b37f85a520d04a3145775cd28084b7f57cf7120005d02a147a371bbdf479bdfba834e54b4423a4d199716d73c01642b748b53d2740b2592b538209","timestamp":1607481533,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It was fun and these could become a good dev onboarding channel (and PR tool at the same time).\n- Appreciate the reduced cost. I would love to eventually increase it back, but in the current circumstances (bad reputation of our collective marketing force and I'm personally skeptical about DCR price growth in the short term) it is a good move to keep _something_ moving forward.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- What is Decredizados and why nobody is asking about it?\n- As everyone I am concerned about measuring efficiency. One interesting proxy I have in mind is support. How many support requests in Spanish are you getting each month and how has this number changed over time?\n- Do you observe any organic growth of activity/content around Decred in Spanish media outlets and social media? (that is, produced outside of this proposal)\n- I _suspect_ that Instagram has more potential in the Spanish world and deserves more attention, perhaps even more than YouTube. What do you think?\n\nBest of luck!","signature":"81e4cb0f21575d7f7b11ac0f575cd243211e19f1b1a3f8514b51fc69178e26e2fd8e73a6e01affba69301e40860c0d681647fda6216de5ace8185df4f095a40d","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"55","receipt":"31ee8a9fa9d2c0e345a41ee587b0705ac351f23512b037da241d1f19a3dffef15ff1886f40530caa9d25c0c31c1b37472d05cc35becfdb1f3ce64cd6c5ac6d0e","timestamp":1608270914,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You not being aware of it is not helpful information unless you have a stash of crypto outreach research to share.\n2. Crypto outreach is not normal product marketing. If we hired a company to market cheeseburgers and the sales in our few local shops wouldn't go up, that would highly suggest our marketers are bad at their job. Here we are \"selling\" (actually, \"onboarding into\") a volatile exotic asset with a huge supply pressure (mining) that we don't even control.\n3. It may take much more marketing force and expenses to move DCR. If we argue about spending $15K to push a $200M+ cap coin in a _non-bullshit_ way, we cannot expect that this effort will be responsible for a large % of Price Go Up.\n\n\u003e If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.\n\nIt is an extremely bold claim to make without proof. Personally I do not believe that Ethereum's insane ICO budget didn't buy them loads of promotion. And I believe large BTC holders are doing the same for BTC.\n\nEven in the universe where Bitcoin did not receive any paid marketing, you keep assuming that what worked for the first mover in an empty market will work in an extremely saturated market. I do not believe it is a working strategy to sit and wait that market awareness will happen by itself these days.\n\n\u003e IYAM crypto marketers have only one job: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. _No other metric counts._\n\nDisagree. Two simple self-tests:\n\n1. If your beloved BTC crashes hard and X/BTC moons as a result, is that a win if your bag of X still buys you the same amount of real goods and services?\n\n2. Will you care about BTC and its few thousand holders as much if it tanks below $10K/5K/2K again?\n\nThere are people who dismiss DCR/BTC price and people obsessed about DCR/BTC price. Both types are too narrow and wrong. Both prices are important in different ways, but the ultimate benchmark is how much real world stuff you can get for 1 DCR.","signature":"76674eddc1b71872341f90544d195b5260bac408de00ee6d5fcce36adf79f5b4180fc4fe5770c8d10e1569cc2bb6b8870a9659048ef01cd16d278c7a86962c0e","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"56","receipt":"2267aab9b9e830c43fedccf8b9fd2f6c5a0122ace4732dd72f058a0690e1265530c0f098dda41296f377a16bdd58541187e122b5ad7c2a9e35375232ba0f110e","timestamp":1608272073,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
