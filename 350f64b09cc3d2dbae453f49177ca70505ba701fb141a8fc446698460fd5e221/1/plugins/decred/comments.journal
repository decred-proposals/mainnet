If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.\n\nIYAM crypto marketers have only *one job*: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. *No other metric counts*.\n\nBased on the lackluster price performance of DCR, it is abundantly clear the ROI of paying anyone to \"market\" Decred in any capacity has been negative. The numerous paid marketing proposals over the years of Decred's history have done absolutely nothing to raise Decred awareness. There are many reasons for this, which I have elaborated on in great detail on Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/u/atweiden\n\nAll crypto marketers paid by this treasury have completely and abjectly failed Decred stakeholders, over and over again. Individuals being paid to manage \"paid marketing results\" in low-impact regions like Latin America should be the *first* to receive the axe.","signature":"82bd0d6326d91addf12c81099e46c700fc4f967ce7b79c691f520f247bfa20167ed3a3c48944c71341a14eba174c4c2130415aa47086ed522a41af36aea5ab06","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"1","receipt":"b8bd4869b3040e43bd06f6ea876063e7996392502cc39728c220619011b0099495bfb5372a7ba80801975cc4812eb424f3d79b98ce3832b6db492e84f8be730d","timestamp":1606870261,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My instinct at this stage is so vote against all marketing proposals that appear 'status quo'. This is not a reflection on the efforts or intentions of those involved, it is indicative of a poor return on investment and low innovation happening in the marketing space. I am not excited by trying the same technique for the same results. Price and community growth is the only metric that marketing can measure against and both have trended down for years. I would like to see people evangelising with new and creative ways, methods for attracting developer talent in particular and getting more bang for our atoms. We need narratives that stick and resonate.\n\nUntil I can be strongly convinced that the proposed marketing strategy is generating appreciable results, I must vote no.","signature":"2541eac1faee8e78ad71e9ebba5fc0110ebc250acf9098a1619abb5b9834dc12eea70beccdac7eb8bf2d777205de2bb92d8131c20444cf00f2842790db3a4809","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"2","receipt":"1fc7f248c7cb49140c2a856807026aa910043a8c2c50e07feb139d051edd0ffce41283cb51b9bb7e48d68fbb9093d13d583f350d7f14c9d2c23be456113c2b06","timestamp":1606906270,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This was to prepare this new dev community for working on projects that contribute to Decred. The ongoing hackathon is the last step. As Elian said, 7 teams are presenting projects.

That it will produce a narrative *so provocative* it will tangibly increase the delta between Decred's perceived progress and Bitcoin's perceived progress measured in BTC terms.\n\nCryptocurrency valuation is a battle of narratives. The most obvious symptom of narrative primacy is organic community activity. Conventional marketing of cryptocurrency has little to no impact on narrative primacy or organic community activity: there are no counterexamples. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, \"Paid Marketing Results\" and \"cryptocurrency\" don't belong in the same sentence.\n\n*\"Does it meme?\"*\n\nAfter looking at DCR/BTC price performance, this is the next question to be asked.\n\nIs the narrative of Latino busy bees working on important sounding marketing things sufficient for creating a provocative narrative? Assuming the market doesn't perceive the delta of that narrative to be positive, it isn't going to positively impact DCR/BTC price, and therefore the value to this treasury *of it* is less than 0.\n\nSeeing as the \"dcrlatam\" team has put forth no provocative ideas of their own — they just want to do more of the same which is *obviously worthless* — this is the only possible provocative narrative they could be contributing to: \"Latino busy bees\". Is that a speculative or *developing* provocative narrative? No. Therefore the value to this treasury is less than 0.\n\nThere is just no sugar coating it. They should be fired, as should every other paid marketer of Decred. Currencies are *belief systems*. There are more people on this planet who believe in \"flat earth\" than who believe in Decred. Who has come up with a narrative at least as strong as that? It isn't even clear if flat earth levels of memeification are sufficient to produce a positive delta against Bitcoin's narrative, which is fundamentally challenging the global economic system.","signature":"84bf6d0fbfb48b97daf82e7063883cbadc1c9cd6f5414ec9e705ff51d6951df848c4d44edd6e39ed12f8683948887f23e790ddaa20c09647c2aa01c7405ae20e","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"10","receipt":"94d92364030af4da8cecfa37dcf1150a9c26ace50b7214c70428b94b7207ebc4af73adf19ae6a3d23367e219c88091b6aa6efc361c2c1e42daa8aaee3cd3fc02","timestamp":1606939952,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
