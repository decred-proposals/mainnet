If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.\n\nIYAM crypto marketers have only *one job*: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. *No other metric counts*.\n\nBased on the lackluster price performance of DCR, it is abundantly clear the ROI of paying anyone to \"market\" Decred in any capacity has been negative. The numerous paid marketing proposals over the years of Decred's history have done absolutely nothing to raise Decred awareness. There are many reasons for this, which I have elaborated on in great detail on Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/u/atweiden\n\nAll crypto marketers paid by this treasury have completely and abjectly failed Decred stakeholders, over and over again. Individuals being paid to manage \"paid marketing results\" in low-impact regions like Latin America should be the *first* to receive the axe.","signature":"82bd0d6326d91addf12c81099e46c700fc4f967ce7b79c691f520f247bfa20167ed3a3c48944c71341a14eba174c4c2130415aa47086ed522a41af36aea5ab06","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"1","receipt":"b8bd4869b3040e43bd06f6ea876063e7996392502cc39728c220619011b0099495bfb5372a7ba80801975cc4812eb424f3d79b98ce3832b6db492e84f8be730d","timestamp":1606870261,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My instinct at this stage is so vote against all marketing proposals that appear 'status quo'. This is not a reflection on the efforts or intentions of those involved, it is indicative of a poor return on investment and low innovation happening in the marketing space. I am not excited by trying the same technique for the same results. Price and community growth is the only metric that marketing can measure against and both have trended down for years. I would like to see people evangelising with new and creative ways, methods for attracting developer talent in particular and getting more bang for our atoms. We need narratives that stick and resonate.\n\nUntil I can be strongly convinced that the proposed marketing strategy is generating appreciable results, I must vote no.","signature":"2541eac1faee8e78ad71e9ebba5fc0110ebc250acf9098a1619abb5b9834dc12eea70beccdac7eb8bf2d777205de2bb92d8131c20444cf00f2842790db3a4809","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"2","receipt":"1fc7f248c7cb49140c2a856807026aa910043a8c2c50e07feb139d051edd0ffce41283cb51b9bb7e48d68fbb9093d13d583f350d7f14c9d2c23be456113c2b06","timestamp":1606906270,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That it will produce a narrative *so provocative* it will tangibly increase the delta between Decred's perceived progress and Bitcoin's perceived progress measured in BTC terms.\n\nCryptocurrency valuation is a battle of narratives. The most obvious symptom of narrative primacy is organic community activity. Conventional marketing of cryptocurrency has little to no impact on narrative primacy or organic community activity: there are no counterexamples. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, \"Paid Marketing Results\" and \"cryptocurrency\" don't belong in the same sentence.\n\n*\"Does it meme?\"*\n\nAfter looking at DCR/BTC price performance, this is the next question to be asked.\n\nIs the narrative of Latino busy bees working on important sounding marketing things sufficient for creating a provocative narrative? Assuming the market doesn't perceive the delta of that narrative to be positive, it isn't going to positively impact DCR/BTC price, and therefore the value to this treasury *of it* is less than 0.\n\nSeeing as the \"dcrlatam\" team has put forth no provocative ideas of their own — they just want to do more of the same which is *obviously worthless* — this is the only possible provocative narrative they could be contributing to: \"Latino busy bees\". Is that a speculative or *developing* provocative narrative? No. Therefore the value to this treasury is less than 0.\n\nThere is just no sugar coating it. They should be fired, as should every other paid marketer of Decred. Currencies are *belief systems*. There are more people on this planet who believe in \"flat earth\" than who believe in Decred. Who has come up with a narrative at least as strong as that?

I must be critical of all proposals at this stage in the market. I am pushing people to innovate and shake things up. I believe we need to expand and get increasingly creative in how we do things on the marketing front, I want to feel inspired by the proposed work and hear about how you intend to expand the pie. Having a scan over your referred report on Github, it seems we have a community of hundreds to just over one thousand members that is proposed to be serviced by $42k worth of DCR. I am not convinced that this is value for money as yet (and I request that you convince me why I am wrong in this opinion or consider tactics/strategies to amplify growth).\n\nRegarding devs, please do not ask me to zoom in, it is your responsibility in this proposal to present such data, objectives and results for me (and others), especially the non spanish speaker stakeholder to assess. The point of Politeia is to inform and make a case to people who have skin in the game but do not have insider knowledge of your workings, especially when outside my native language. It is unreasonable for you to expect me to have insider knowledge of your results.","signature":"6313720060e0e303d50b1ce61eb4a4caa60d2da08561420a4e6500f1313a94b4159e8ed3938ea53c9f056c4896d456721f3ea256121c931b0ea4d98afa70cb00","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"11","receipt":"35effcf8d8a981722237cd041387a53f0470c3d2d7b4e04e4e04dd3b6f5e1460cb6fe8589951d7e7a15942f8b0a6850718ccdb65724fe2db381573c93767f105","timestamp":1606945069,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I am a technically minded old mate and do not know how to attract talent. This is possibly a good question for Raedah who literally does this style of dev team building for devs globally.\n\nWhat I am far more proficient at is building teams and providing guidance big picture on strategy and having trained many people in my field of engineering, I totally understand the balance between dedicating your time in building understanding vs that understanding taking root and inspiring new ideas. I am quite supportive of your idea to create videos (reusable content) and hackathons as this is immediate dev focus, allows self study and gets people inside the codebase. **Create a Decred academy.** Help people get inside the code and roadmap where to start contributing. This is the kind of outreach that will win my support.\n\nThe narrative of Decred employing talented devs, paid in USD value in nations with challenging currency conditions like LATAM, Africa, Asia etc is not only inspirational, but world changing. If you can expand this narrative and make it real, now you are talking about something that has my support.\n\nFocus on attracting devs, Build the narrative. When I am convinced these two goals are the target output, I become more bullish on the proposal.","signature":"c3e56bd7656446dbc92e688896e1b63dc5e2cd52cf9c0ac2bf8a9c0317b683df4f4ac6819ec58dd7da5bfd9f0e8e74e52cf36dd88272268003626c2668a8e50d","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"13","receipt":"c1e8c3fa1afc74d30bd10c84b988da2ecaf661d5308c8c34506f2b11d29f035fc8822cd5264395fa3a1c2e0b345e31dbd0171bb53ed5d75c1ad2e6724e9e6407","timestamp":1606946433,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There's a couple *thousand* people in our world *at most* who control all the BTC. Your job is to make *their BTC* touch *our DCR*.\n\nAsk yourself something: why would the tiny number of humans in control of the overwhelming majority of BTC care about whether an altcoin community is putting on paid marketing events in Latin America?\n\nI can back this up even further and ask *who* the people are who control all the bitcoin. And the answer is a mix of leftist anarchists and ultra-wealthy investors. Make no mistake: these are your \"customers\" who you are marketing to. You are not marketing to Latin America: you are marketing to Latin America *in the hopes* of *signaling* to the couple *thousand* anarchists and investors living in North America, Western Europe and East Asia who *matter* that Decred is worth investing in.\n\nIYAM, it would take nothing short of a South American *Crypto Woodstock* for these people to be arsed enough to care even in the slightest about a \"paid marketing event\" of any sort. People are so jaded to this unprincipled, inorganic marketing bullshit by now, I doubt if even the biggest crypto conferences matter anymore at all — dick measuring contexts aside.\n\nI'm truly sorry people were nice to you at any point in your cryptocurrency upbringing.
