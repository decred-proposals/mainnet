If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.\n\nIYAM crypto marketers have only *one job*: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. *No other metric counts*.\n\nBased on the lackluster price performance of DCR, it is abundantly clear the ROI of paying anyone to \"market\" Decred in any capacity has been negative. The numerous paid marketing proposals over the years of Decred's history have done absolutely nothing to raise Decred awareness. There are many reasons for this, which I have elaborated on in great detail on Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/u/atweiden\n\nAll crypto marketers paid by this treasury have completely and abjectly failed Decred stakeholders, over and over again. Individuals being paid to manage \"paid marketing results\" in low-impact regions like Latin America should be the *first* to receive the axe.","signature":"82bd0d6326d91addf12c81099e46c700fc4f967ce7b79c691f520f247bfa20167ed3a3c48944c71341a14eba174c4c2130415aa47086ed522a41af36aea5ab06","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"1","receipt":"b8bd4869b3040e43bd06f6ea876063e7996392502cc39728c220619011b0099495bfb5372a7ba80801975cc4812eb424f3d79b98ce3832b6db492e84f8be730d","timestamp":1606870261,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My instinct at this stage is so vote against all marketing proposals that appear 'status quo'. This is not a reflection on the efforts or intentions of those involved, it is indicative of a poor return on investment and low innovation happening in the marketing space. I am not excited by trying the same technique for the same results. Price and community growth is the only metric that marketing can measure against and both have trended down for years. I would like to see people evangelising with new and creative ways, methods for attracting developer talent in particular and getting more bang for our atoms. We need narratives that stick and resonate.\n\nUntil I can be strongly convinced that the proposed marketing strategy is generating appreciable results, I must vote no.","signature":"2541eac1faee8e78ad71e9ebba5fc0110ebc250acf9098a1619abb5b9834dc12eea70beccdac7eb8bf2d777205de2bb92d8131c20444cf00f2842790db3a4809","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"2","receipt":"1fc7f248c7cb49140c2a856807026aa910043a8c2c50e07feb139d051edd0ffce41283cb51b9bb7e48d68fbb9093d13d583f350d7f14c9d2c23be456113c2b06","timestamp":1606906270,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
