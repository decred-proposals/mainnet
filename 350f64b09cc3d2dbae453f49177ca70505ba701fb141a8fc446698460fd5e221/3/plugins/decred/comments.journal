If we look at what Bitcoin and Ethereum did, none of their successes were borne out of paid marketing channels.\n\nIYAM crypto marketers have only *one job*: to increase the price of DCR measured in BTC. *No other metric counts*.\n\nBased on the lackluster price performance of DCR, it is abundantly clear the ROI of paying anyone to \"market\" Decred in any capacity has been negative. The numerous paid marketing proposals over the years of Decred's history have done absolutely nothing to raise Decred awareness. There are many reasons for this, which I have elaborated on in great detail on Reddit: https://old.reddit.com/u/atweiden\n\nAll crypto marketers paid by this treasury have completely and abjectly failed Decred stakeholders, over and over again. Individuals being paid to manage \"paid marketing results\" in low-impact regions like Latin America should be the *first* to receive the axe.","signature":"82bd0d6326d91addf12c81099e46c700fc4f967ce7b79c691f520f247bfa20167ed3a3c48944c71341a14eba174c4c2130415aa47086ed522a41af36aea5ab06","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"1","receipt":"b8bd4869b3040e43bd06f6ea876063e7996392502cc39728c220619011b0099495bfb5372a7ba80801975cc4812eb424f3d79b98ce3832b6db492e84f8be730d","timestamp":1606870261,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My instinct at this stage is so vote against all marketing proposals that appear 'status quo'. This is not a reflection on the efforts or intentions of those involved, it is indicative of a poor return on investment and low innovation happening in the marketing space. I am not excited by trying the same technique for the same results. Price and community growth is the only metric that marketing can measure against and both have trended down for years. I would like to see people evangelising with new and creative ways, methods for attracting developer talent in particular and getting more bang for our atoms. We need narratives that stick and resonate.\n\nUntil I can be strongly convinced that the proposed marketing strategy is generating appreciable results, I must vote no.","signature":"2541eac1faee8e78ad71e9ebba5fc0110ebc250acf9098a1619abb5b9834dc12eea70beccdac7eb8bf2d777205de2bb92d8131c20444cf00f2842790db3a4809","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"2","receipt":"1fc7f248c7cb49140c2a856807026aa910043a8c2c50e07feb139d051edd0ffce41283cb51b9bb7e48d68fbb9093d13d583f350d7f14c9d2c23be456113c2b06","timestamp":1606906270,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That it will produce a narrative *so provocative* it will tangibly increase the delta between Decred's perceived progress and Bitcoin's perceived progress measured in BTC terms.\n\nCryptocurrency valuation is a battle of narratives. The most obvious symptom of narrative primacy is organic community activity. Conventional marketing of cryptocurrency has little to no impact on narrative primacy or organic community activity: there are no counterexamples. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, \"Paid Marketing Results\" and \"cryptocurrency\" don't belong in the same sentence.\n\n*\"Does it meme?\"*\n\nAfter looking at DCR/BTC price performance, this is the next question to be asked.\n\nIs the narrative of Latino busy bees working on important sounding marketing things sufficient for creating a provocative narrative? Assuming the market doesn't perceive the delta of that narrative to be positive, it isn't going to positively impact DCR/BTC price, and therefore the value to this treasury *of it* is less than 0.\n\nSeeing as the \"dcrlatam\" team has put forth no provocative ideas of their own — they just want to do more of the same which is *obviously worthless* — this is the only possible provocative narrative they could be contributing to: \"Latino busy bees\". Is that a speculative or *developing* provocative narrative? No. Therefore the value to this treasury is less than 0.\n\nThere is just no sugar coating it. They should be fired, as should every other paid marketer of Decred. Currencies are *belief systems*. There are more people on this planet who believe in \"flat earth\" than who believe in Decred. Who has come up with a narrative at least as strong as that?

I must be critical of all proposals at this stage in the market. I am pushing people to innovate and shake things up. I believe we need to expand and get increasingly creative in how we do things on the marketing front, I want to feel inspired by the proposed work and hear about how you intend to expand the pie. Having a scan over your referred report on Github, it seems we have a community of hundreds to just over one thousand members that is proposed to be serviced by $42k worth of DCR. I am not convinced that this is value for money as yet (and I request that you convince me why I am wrong in this opinion or consider tactics/strategies to amplify growth).\n\nRegarding devs, please do not ask me to zoom in, it is your responsibility in this proposal to present such data, objectives and results for me (and others), especially the non spanish speaker stakeholder to assess. The point of Politeia is to inform and make a case to people who have skin in the game but do not have insider knowledge of your workings, especially when outside my native language. It is unreasonable for you to expect me to have insider knowledge of your results.","signature":"6313720060e0e303d50b1ce61eb4a4caa60d2da08561420a4e6500f1313a94b4159e8ed3938ea53c9f056c4896d456721f3ea256121c931b0ea4d98afa70cb00","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"11","receipt":"35effcf8d8a981722237cd041387a53f0470c3d2d7b4e04e4e04dd3b6f5e1460cb6fe8589951d7e7a15942f8b0a6850718ccdb65724fe2db381573c93767f105","timestamp":1606945069,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I am a technically minded old mate and do not know how to attract talent. This is possibly a good question for Raedah who literally does this style of dev team building for devs globally.\n\nWhat I am far more proficient at is building teams and providing guidance big picture on strategy and having trained many people in my field of engineering, I totally understand the balance between dedicating your time in building understanding vs that understanding taking root and inspiring new ideas. I am quite supportive of your idea to create videos (reusable content) and hackathons as this is immediate dev focus, allows self study and gets people inside the codebase. **Create a Decred academy.** Help people get inside the code and roadmap where to start contributing. This is the kind of outreach that will win my support.\n\nThe narrative of Decred employing talented devs, paid in USD value in nations with challenging currency conditions like LATAM, Africa, Asia etc is not only inspirational, but world changing. If you can expand this narrative and make it real, now you are talking about something that has my support.\n\nFocus on attracting devs, Build the narrative. When I am convinced these two goals are the target output, I become more bullish on the proposal.","signature":"c3e56bd7656446dbc92e688896e1b63dc5e2cd52cf9c0ac2bf8a9c0317b683df4f4ac6819ec58dd7da5bfd9f0e8e74e52cf36dd88272268003626c2668a8e50d","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"13","receipt":"c1e8c3fa1afc74d30bd10c84b988da2ecaf661d5308c8c34506f2b11d29f035fc8822cd5264395fa3a1c2e0b345e31dbd0171bb53ed5d75c1ad2e6724e9e6407","timestamp":1606946433,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There's a couple *thousand* people in our world *at most* who control all the BTC. Your job is to make *their BTC* touch *our DCR*.\n\nAsk yourself something: why would the tiny number of humans in control of the overwhelming majority of BTC care about whether an altcoin community is putting on paid marketing events in Latin America?\n\nI can back this up even further and ask *who* the people are who control all the bitcoin. And the answer is a mix of leftist anarchists and ultra-wealthy investors. Make no mistake: these are your \"customers\" who you are marketing to. You are not marketing to Latin America: you are marketing to Latin America *in the hopes* of *signaling* to the couple *thousand* anarchists and investors living in North America, Western Europe and East Asia who *matter* that Decred is worth investing in.\n\nIYAM, it would take nothing short of a South American *Crypto Woodstock* for these people to be arsed enough to care even in the slightest about a \"paid marketing event\" of any sort.

You're right, one of the big issues that I see is that all the work that is done in Decred in Spanish is hardly observed by stakeholders that don't speak Spanish. Having a [Github repository](https://github.com/DecredES/Monthly_reports) with all the reports was a first step, but I recon that reports are not sexy, however reporting has been a priority since the first proposal.   \n\nCompletely agree with you on being creative with marketing, by the way, this proposal doesn't not have the word marketing in it, how can we marketing a product that we cannot measure how is being sold? I recon that outreach and communications is more align with the work we do.  On this regard, I think the [first steps through out 2019 and early 2020](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5af0ce1) were to gain brand awareness from the professionals and leaders of the industry in Latam. An example of how this resulted is this acknowledgement of recent price action by [Anibal Garrido](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1334317634880479239), a well known and respected crypto trader in Venezuela. We met back in March when [I presented the project in Valencia, Venezuela](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1236079742643773440), you can see him in the front of the picture with a Bitcoin t-shirt. Since then [Anibal has invited us](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1278478260716933120) to talk about [governance](https://twitter.com/anibalcripto/status/1279191924835061761), you can spot he is wearing a blue Decred t-shirt that I gave him in Venezuela, later on [we invited him](https://twitter.com/Decred_ES/status/1313526622927171585) to talk about Venezuela in [#HablemosDecred](https://youtu.be/xxNFxZJuOwA)).\n\nThe next step in the big strategy for Decred in Spanish is to keep [building a platform of communications](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b67) through Decred_ES, which I arguably is only a few hundreds nearing a thousand people, however this is now recognised as an established brand in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Spanish. I'd argue that other projects have gone the same route after us: [Algorand](https://twitter.com/Algorand_ES), [Avalanche](https://twitter.com/avalanche_esp), [Bisq](https://twitter.com/BisqEs), [Nervos](https://twitter.com/NervosNetworkES), setting the standard? \n\nI'll like to show you the [opinion of a dev](https://imgur.com/a/symKi18) that is participating in the [Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge](url) that portraits what we are aiming at Decred in Spanish: \n\n\u003e \"This is my first hackathon, the experience was incredible, Decred in Spanish community has been helpful and attentive, you were amazing guys. The last hour I almost got a stroke, my video wasn't uploading to Youtube. So many hours of learning, this was a completely new world for me as a dev, thank you so much to everyone!!\"\n\nCan't go much into details because winners selection is this week but the ideas that are coming from this event are really good, furthermore, we are training new devs into the arts of Decred, several of them are interested in continue learning how to contribute to the project development. The Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge gave us [+6 hours of content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHZZTXR_CIhJrZHnf3xgUrF6EdNsuG_Qa) for Youtube, +15,000 views into the [microsite](https://www.talentland.talent-republic.tv/challenge/blockchain-learning-challenge-decred/), 138 registrations and 7 final projects that are connecting to Decred's blockchain. \n\nMuch of our work is to find ways to interact with the Spanish speaking cryptocurrency audience beyond price. We all love when PGU (price goes up) but no one like when PGD (price goes down). My main objetive is to build something that does not rely on PGU but in all the aspects that surround the technology that makes possible for PGU on the first place. The objective of Decred in Spanish is to keep building regardless of PGU or PGD, our content aims to tackle more issues surrounding the industry. Further more, as every other project or coin just want to sell their token to the retail market, having started Decred in Spanish not from the stance of \"buy DCR\" but from \"come and consume our wealth of knowledge\", many doors have open up over time because the space recognise that we sincerely want to share our tech and wealth of knowledge for everyone else to grow with us. \n\nYou're right, even though the Github repo gives a lot of information there are still plenty of data, objectives and insights that could be there to give stakeholders more information to asses the work of Decred in Spanish. There are still plenty of things for reporting that could give better information for stakeholders, I've been working [on it with bee](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/pull/75) and even tho is not explicitly contemplated in the proposal included in it,[ reporting, reporting, reporting](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/tree/master/index). Still plenty to update and take it to the next level that is to link it to social media channels, telegram bots and the Decred in Spanish website (included in this proposal) to track engagement and give insights to stakeholders on what is working and what is not. The reduction of 10% in this proposal from previous translate in no paid sponsorships for the next 6 months, they were useless in comparison to what the Decred Challenge gave us in return. I care to maximise what every atom can bring to the table, to repeat what is working and cut what is not. \n\nThanks  for being part of this conversation.","signature":"d6aba43fbc2a36dc696853eeb7f469f18dfe074845c52e1222e5161269f39c024c9316314a4fd787a0fee70a225fab1f9c9539603ec12719a97bb8548a992607","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"25","receipt":"5f6c93be0e05facd9b06eaa7b8700dc0aac76b62228a4c6f0c174653acfa107e5908f60d5ec01ddd728648a1bcbd02faf6f941550125e3a725622754e4cc5907","timestamp":1607014988,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

After meeting him one to one we settle the ground for continuous collaboration, the articles and press releases of previous proposal that we have publish in Cointelegraph have over 14k views.  \n\nAdding more information to the Decred Talent Land Blockchain Challenge, adcade has now released the  6 final projects that are going to be evaluated over the next days, please visit [the following Github repository](https://github.com/DecredES/Challenge/blob/main/Final_Projects.md) to know more. I think this is going to inspire you the same way it inspire me. Thanks to adcade for owning the coordination and all necessary to make it happen, just to imagine the work behind here an [image of the communications behind](https://imgur.com/a/vmvOOWI) the challenge.\n\nAnd in regard to the Decred in Spanish, nachito has worked on mockups of how it would look both in [desktop](https://www.figma.com/file/vZdqKU5OgOkGgVf3oMmKeb/dcresp_desktop?node-id=1%3A2) and [mobile](https://www.figma.com/file/zwPbN8BlkD7RORfXBR1CSg/dcresp_mobile?node-id=0%3A1).

They've demonstrated a huge effort in trying to get the word out, unfortunately said content has not gotten the traction one would've hoped given the following, views and engagement numbers. However, I do understand the wider community's apprehensiveness on continued funding for these activities when it seems like the only useful marketing and outreach strategy is for the DCR price to go up, which is really outside of anyone's control.\n\nThat being said, and I have my bias having been born and raised and Venezuela myself, I think it would be a mistake to completely drop our efforts in the region. There is a huge opportunity in Latin America for Decred to have a meaningful impact throughout this upcoming market cycle, not quite as a store of value or medium of exchange, but as a decentralized autonomous organisation than can hire engineering talent from anywhere in the world, pushing the envelope by fostering the development of open source technology for the benefit of the wider ecosystem with no strings or rent-seeking attached. This isn't about being a charity or some SJW nonsense, necessity is the mother of invention, and I think efforts like the [Locha Mesh](https://locha.io/) are a great example of this.\n\nThe Decred stack has grown quite a lot over the past few years: decrediton, dcrtime, politea, mobile apps, lightning network, dcrdex, it truly is the Swiss army knife of crypto. IMHO the challenge is now to scale and gain developer and engineering mind-share, probably the scarcest resource in the space, to get people not just using Decred, but building on it.\n\nLightning Network may be a great platform to do this, and Decred's user on-boarding is considerably easier than Bitcoin's - the toughest part is to buy DCR.\n\nI really haven't been following the ongoing hackathon, but I do think this these sort of efforts are a step in the right direction and would like to see the proposal geared more towards attracting talent.","signature":"59c07cc91a5986bf2f147cc434aacc02e1444665aa8ce2e95fb7311c72c52c0990054097b2dc6869c25b82097efbe8eb8ae6b9f9e1f2c1709cda6052bfba6e07","publickey":"e5507f79c3df82af9845225deaf9ffc60f2abb0ab8cceaa77b48b8f64d3b2976","commentid":"27","receipt":"09a015368ba437b0ead79440d4ca363ae42690bc68ac352efffd8768ec90d408d7712052536c23e81b06b836d79759159f495eea03530248b0ca9f9f12e7440b","timestamp":1607078694,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I have never had interest in social justice, it has no appeal to me and was never the undertone, that is your misinformed read. The ability to employ people globally is not a narrative, it is a reality and an opportunity. We can employ talented devs to expand the protocol base without a bank account. Much of Raedah's crew are in Africa, Asia and we have a strong presence in LATAM which is why I posit this as a path forward for where such a proposal could focus.","signature":"5f0c440eba6a855e9e51d7f083b80e8806f85ab899329a16f70075bfa08b1703c62ecbbb3e2732e5023137dcc81e02f745a6ddb19ecc048ffd9dfecf9a653f0e","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"28","receipt":"aefbe1890142046b5ffdeda8bfbb87ac4f897fc25e584da5301f954df1f4b6757d48da005f2ab7b181894a36c689d8a1ec039ffc279a553b6cdc6184ccc71f03","timestamp":1607079551,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
