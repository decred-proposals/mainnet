Decred in Spanish Communications and Content Creation Proposal 3

**What:** This proposal will cover 6 months of funding for content creation, design, virtual events, business development, social media management, user support, community organising and general communications outreach in Spanish. 

**Why:** This new proposal aims to continue with Decred in Spanish communications,  outreach and content creation to drive engagement for the Spanish speaking audiences that follow Decred Project. Furthermore, [Spain](https://www.europeworldnews.com/six-keys-to-understanding-how-cryptocurrencies-work-in-spain/) and [Latin America](https://www.garrigues.com/en_GB/garrigues-digital/cryptocurrencies-emerging-rules-lead-way-latin-america) are among the countries with more people [holding cryptocurrencies](https://www.statista.com/chart/18345/crypto-currency-adoption/). Latam represents about a quarter of all Bitcoin transactions on [localBitcoins](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXICfh1UYAAOm3R?format=jpg&name=large) and of the top 10 countries where users have [different cryptocurrencies](https://medium.com/dovewallet-en/which-country-has-the-highest-percentage-of-users-with-11-or-more-digital-assets-8b1fcb008b35), Latam has 3 of them and also 3 are Spanish speaking countries, showing that adoption in the region [continues to growth](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2020-global-cryptocurrency-adoption-index-2020). 

**How:** We have created a regular flow of social media content to drive engagement and brand awareness of Decred’s ecosystem in Spanish. We create content, engage with other industry leaders, present the project in virtual events and articulate our work with the broader cryptocurrency industry space. Our main goal for the next 6 months is to grow our audience by a minimum of 80% and double down our available content in Spanish.

Decred in Spanish has structured workflows for video content production, press releases, user support, social media and community management. As we continue building Decred's community across the Spanish speaking world, having dedicated content for dev recruitment will be paramount. We will continue with cross marketing opportunities with Tier 1 projects, organisations and institutions looking to explore blockchain and broader technology issues with Decred in Spanish.
