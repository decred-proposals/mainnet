In order to illustrate why, consider the structure of the commitment tree and the generation process.\n\n```\n     CommitmentRoot   \n      /          \\\n  h(c1||c2)  h(c3||c4)\n    /    \\     /    \\\n   c1    c2   c3     c4\n```\n\nLet's assume that `c1` is the GCS filter commitment, `c2` is your hypothesized dcrtime merkle root, and `c3`/`c4` are commitments to other data.\n\nNaturally in order to generate (and later validate) the `CommitmentRoot` you need to know that values of each of those leaf nodes (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`).\n\n`c1` would be generated by creating the filter and hashing it.  Then, that hash needs to itself be hashed with `c2` to generate the `h(c1||c2)` intermediate node and the process repeats until the root is generated.  This necessarily means that `c2` has to be known, come from somewhere, and is now committed to by consensus via the `CommitmentRoot`.  Thus, even if nodes aren't verifying the validity of `c2` itself, it is still necessarily a part of consensus.\n\nThe bigger problem though is that if `c2` can't be generated from the block data itself, that implies it must be coming from some external entity, which introduces several issues for consensus because it would no longer be self contained nor decentralized.  In other words, it would introduce reliance on one or more 3rd-party oracles which moves into the realm  of the oracle problem.\n\nFor completeness, while I know it was just an example, it's worth noting that the dcrtime Merkle roots are already completely provable because they are included in an OP_RETURN in a transaction which itself is included in a Merkle tree whose root is committed to and enforced by the `MerkleRoot`header field which every full node faithfully validates.  Moving to a non-consensus enforced proof there would actually remove the security guarantees the current system provides and therefore largely remove its utility.\n\nAny non-consensus enforced commitments can simply be delivered by a peer-to-peer message.","signature":"95976e613135bb178d247acbe22123fbdb2a292770db875a62c5d5087e8903ed761cafac268fb4bbe0990e9b5e76abc43d3fde463c62b17a2aedfebace13f402","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"4","receipt":"210070973a0c90a3031b0d81fcb8873fb0a000be9a2488c371ab331b9a7e68e67da87b414657c29e928034082b53566393499ff4efca0c21bade1c7757d74201","timestamp":1559344300,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There are no on-chain commitments of these filters yet, it appears the plan is to add to the filter commitment as a soft fork by tacking it into the coinbase transaction as an additional OP_RETURN.\n2. OP_RETURN transactions are not part of the commitments at all, due to a circular dependency issue (the filter commitment OP_RETURN value obviously cannot reference itself in its construction). This limits some potential use cases. \n\nIt will be really interesting to see if/how an effort soft fork Bitcoin to append the filter commitments to the coinbase transaction plays out. It may be contentious since the additional data does take up valuable block space. \n\nI love how Decred's ability to execute a clean hard fork makes it possible to implement the same end goal as BIP 158 in a simpler, more efficient and more useful general purpose way. It's telling how modifying the headers is not even mentioned as a possibility in any of the BIP 157/158 discussions!\n\nAs for OP_RETURN... it looks like Decred's commitments will include the entire transaction set and would therefore open up potential use cases for light clients to utilize OP_RETURN, such as those created by dcrtime, securely.\n\nBig yes from me!","signature":"b4831043e9b0a75c8b1532b75e9feaa868ed54f7d39d3cd17b0012fc893350d753b5153300b8c39c73b7391361019d3967298429180b65a00fabdd621603680e","publickey":"3349d5c64771a57b0993d5f506ba1dec07123ddfe6b312c5bc99236b8bbdbbb5","commentid":"8","receipt":"df14e29acd78c86e6f8d7c355cce56ce7d4d0f5c5bb134ad7ce2d87f37f122f0f56fae6ac6c767a22159fe47b8139314369cabe07a37874efb8293aa1a2b620d","timestamp":1559502346,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The part of this proposal that refers to introducing version 2 of the filters includes additional optimizations that have been devised since then, including those in the aforementioned BIP.\n\nWhile you did hint at it by discussing the fact that putting the additional data in the coinbase would take up valuable block space and mentioning that the Decred approach outlined in this proposal is more efficient and more general purpose, I thought it might be good to make that point more explicit by calling out that the approach taken by this proposal does not take up any additional block space at all since the data gets rolled up into a single Merkle root that takes the place of the current `StakeRoot` field in the header and the existing `StakeRoot` field is folded into the `MerkleRoot` field.  This is an important consideration since increasing the amount of data that must be stored on chain is always something that must be done with great care.\n\nIn regards to `OP_RETURN` data, you're correct on all accounts.  The data will be included in the `GCSFilterRegularV2` filters, and consequently, light clients will indeed be able to securely utilize data in them as you postulate.","signature":"1d5166487975bb83009b110ae3aa0a94f96cd4cd184c09ca4428a5690c504f2a2061eb6cf03633484b239c940e90dda3e7a18a5d302ad3c4739916d8fb758300","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"9","receipt":"e7d56761763e65291034f7e95b8ffa1ff41c9de6160131c604f776f953eaacc0456337928cdfc65e99ed9fe47e7b45853295ab69dbf588e05f738d2ef6f33105","timestamp":1559553438,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
