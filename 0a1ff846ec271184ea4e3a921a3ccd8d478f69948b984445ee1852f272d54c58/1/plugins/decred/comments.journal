Nice touch on splitting into two sections for different audiences, though personally I'm more interested in the technical side of things :)\n\n\u003e This approach provides an extensible and efficient method of consensus-enforced proof chaining which allows the block header to commit to an arbitrary number of short proofs which thin clients can very quickly verify.\n\nDoes this mean _every_ future dataset that generates a commitment will _necessarily_ be a part of consensus or do you see this being used for non-consensus enforced (i.e. off-chain) inclusion proofs as well?\n\nThe GCS filters meant for light clients obviously need to be checked and _should_ be a part of consensus but I'm wondering if you think we'll also ones which (from the PoV of consensus) are only opaque commitments.\n\nRandom showerthought to exemplify what I mean by this: instead of using OP_RETURNs for dcrtime anchors, include a commitment for dcrtime's merkle root for a given period without having full nodes necessarily validate what the underlying dcrtime data is.\n\nThe individual commitments that are not checked via consensus rules have weaker security guarantees then the ones that are (and depend on mechanisms other than regular Decred full nodes to be useful) but I'm wondering whether you believe they should never even be considered or if you see this being useful in the future.","signature":"d6ed0264beb244262f803cde0c5d773ed828cb5ec4fe341c956d573a90fb69c49a3917b5b1c7af94083a93231b271108bfd4abf921060649937bc4cb1e399006","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"1","receipt":"b148b92b4c098706b24682bb8fef40c1e140b3812ad443aea80f791576116e14c0927e8dd882992d0ca8bf4051fbadeba5ce90a2c0b61c62992831b9f781d40a","timestamp":1559303741,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
