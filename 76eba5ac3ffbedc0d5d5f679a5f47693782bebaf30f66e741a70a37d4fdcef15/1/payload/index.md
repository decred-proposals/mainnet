Design domain budgets: 03.21 - 12.21

**Why?**

This is the second general design domain spending for the core design contractors and their on-going work for the remainder of 2021 (01.03.2021 – 31.12.2012). Stakeholders authorize the budget and general work plans described below, the design contractors continue to work autonomously within the approved parameters.

Work-specific details, among complete deliverables, are archived in the [gh/dcrdesign](http://github.com/decred/dcrdesign) repo and Figma. After the end of the funding period, I will create a report in the form of a log, listing the larger tasks and goals which were completed, a summary of occurred expenditure, and any issues that occurred.

**Past period expenditure**

Overall the contractors have spent total of ~37.1k of 65k . The subdomains breakdown is the following:

UI/UX ~27.9k of 35 000 $

Identity ~3.9k of 16 000 $

Visual comms. ~5.3k of 14 000 $

Total expenditure was ~60% of the [initial proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1dc1571). Most progress was made in UI/UX, as many of the prioritized items were completed. Dcrweb and godcr received additionally requested work. No work was done on CMS. In terms of the identity subdomain, the largest project being the tutorials had the preliminary milestone completed, and is ready to continue with production over the coming period. Visual branding guidelines and repos were not significantly updated. Requests were made for consistent use of DCR symbol on several major platforms. Summarized log with references of the past period work can be found at: [https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/252](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/252)

Regarding issues, the initial proposal had an awkward starting time, during the late summer period, this lead to less availability than initially planned. Problems with itemization were noted in CMS.

**Areas of focus**

The design domain has functioned since the near launch of Decred and over time formed into three larger subdomains.

**UI/UX:** Covers of the design efforts towards improving Decred's products* (*which don't have individual proposals/teams), the ecosystem as well as blockchain usability in general. Each product receives design support based on what's reasonable and requested regarding development and known usability issues. The design domain provides: general UX design support, presents conceptual input on working out practical solutions, helps with the implementation and testing for bugs, as well works in general towards improving usability, efficiency, accessibility, and detecting pain-points.

**Identity:** Covers fundamental assets, methods, guidelines part of the DCR visual branding and related graphical content production with a longer shelf-life. Over time we have created a treasure-drove of practical methods, concepts, assets, and templates that have saved a tremendous amount of production time in recycling assets.

**Visual comms:** Creative, graphical, and motion production work and providing design support to ad-hoc requests, ie. keynote presentations, social media posts, print assets at events, etc. The items are generally with shorter shelf-life or less-critical use needs. As a rough consensus amongst the domain is keeping things light and holding a critical view on requests which are found excess and wasteful. Visual comms. production often recycles practical identity assets and prior creations where possible. Questionable requests are reviewed in the design-ops, (which also includes core contributors from other domains)

**Subdomain Projects and Budgets**

Below are budget caps for maximum billing amounts against this proposal and its subdomains.

- Only design specific work based on spent hours can be billed against this proposal
- Designers continue to bill their existing rates in agreement with DHG
- Billing format: line item will contain, individual contractor/subcontractor name, occurred hours task, a short description (when possible reference to gh issue #nr)
- Billing is also tracked internally and submitted as a summarized report at the end of the period
- Budgets allow for re-allocation within subdomains if agreed on as a group and not conflicting with anyone else's work

**##UI/UX** 

Bulk of the work outlined for Piui, consolidating a UI library in Figma, as well dcrios/android and godcr were completed. Over this period we would focus further on Politeia, dcrweb and CMS as well continue working on the library and providing design input, testing releases and gathering user input.

**Pi-ui**

- Continue UI improvements work on Piui library, help sync up the design and front-end
- Create missing and additional components
- Setup team libraries, organize and clean-up assets and icons to improve accessibility and consistent use
- Provide design-support for ad-hoc requests

**Politeia**

- Finalize concept designs on improving discussion and messaging experience
- Improve proposal status lifecycle
- Testing and implementation support
- Improve budgeting insights if development interest is present
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**Decrediton**

- UI visual designs for the LN, launcher and Trezor concepts
- Design support for on-going issues and requests
- High contrast dark and light mode key examples
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**Dcrweb**

As for dcrweb, there’s a log of items from the past proposal still to be addressed

- Staking improvements on dcrweb, /vsp subpage overhaul (*in relation to motion and graphics production)
- News and Posts* – any efforts to help proceed with this
- Identity subpage – update and re-populate
- Support subpage
- Smaller issues regarding legibility and dated assets
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**CMS**

- Conduct research on the current release and touchpoint on issues, areas with most need and potential for improvements
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

Removals:

- Dcrios/android/godcr are not covered by this proposal, instead in their individual product proposals as requested.

**##Identity**

- Continue the staking and onboarding tutorials production
- Create a simple id assets and guidelines update, migrate to Figma
- Maintain repos on gh, figma and lottie and create new identity assets on a needs basis (ie. icons for UI, key visuals, etc)
- Proactively support best practices in Decred's identity use (ie. where found negatively presenting the project in high-value placement)

**##Visual Comms.**

- Manage and respond to requests in need of design support in areas of project representation, communications, and visual branding, either via submission to gh/dcrdesign or from existing and proven project contributors.
- Design and consulting on keynotes and presentations
- Key visuals/motion for releases and announcements

Removals:

- Dcr/pi journals renders production is billed against the corresponding project proposal.
- Decred contributor caricatures are no longer supported by the domain proposal. Anyone interested in having one can either: a) Directly commission either Kärt or Lustosa b) Have a go yourself or with help with an illustrator by following this guideline [https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/47](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/47) and leveraging the existing assets

**Figma team subscription**

 We're proposing the setup a Decred Team space in Figma, as we've already succesfully migrated the UI/UX workflow there and see potential in handling bulk of the design domain activities. Figma subscription allows for an “Organization space”, which provides the co-editing user permissions, alongside with unlimited projects (rather than 2 per team), version history and shareable team libraries. The subscription would be for 4 seats on annual plan 12$/mo – 576$ total and up to 3-4 hotspot monthly seats 15$ added on needs basis. Paid seats mean these users are with editing rights – free users can be added as viewers, accessing specs (devs) as well to download (copy) the files.

Risks/cons:

I can assume this may be opposed as it's common for designers and devs to usually pay for their own tools, licensing etc. Unlike adobe or sketch, which are typically billing towards either individual designers or agencies, Figma's "freemium" subscription model goes toward billing "client organizations" when it comes to more than 2 people collaborating. The difference between free and paid accounts comes down to the collaboration features, providing better accessibility, version control and scaling features. In many ways this is similar to how github handles collaboration. A free plan can essentially work for DCR still, but will mean worse work experience as up to two editors can work on a file; files will be larger; time saving teams and libraries organization and automation features are not available.

In case of canceling the subscription, bulk of the created assets will still remain accessible and available – though accessibility is downgraded to limits based on the free plan (2+ user editing access and pro collaboration features are lost). All files can also be manually backed up to Gh or any host, as well be worked as copies.


**Totals**

UI/UX $34 000 – with a rough cap of up to ~35% per product

Identity $14 000 – largely a continuation of last period proposal; tutorials as biggest project is on track

Visual Comms $10 000

Figma subscription $576 - 850

The budgets above are calculated on: both known burn on tasks, higher-level estimates on larger tasks, an average availability of up to 1-2/day per week/contributor, and continuing of the unspent budget of the previous proposal.
The budgets also contain a small buffer, which can be used to fund new design contributors, as long as the following is met: demonstrate positive character in collaboration and at least a median standard of work quality (in terms of thinking, creative, methodical and production abilities) as well as an understanding of the project.
