I am glad to see the same team staying on board, you are all assets for the project.\n\nWhat I would love to see is coordination between our design team and whatever we have as a marketing outfit. Target would be to produce Decred branded collateral. Both design and marketing are beyond my pay-grade or knowledge base however I respect there is an interconnection between the two. I believe Decred needs proactive ideas on how we 'show off' via attractive, professional graphics (which this team is well qualified for) that can readily be shared, this feels like a quick easy win. It could be as simple as taking Decred values (privacy, security, free speech etc) or new/existing product releases distilled into clean social ready collateral items. Open to ideas on this.\n\nWill be a yes from me, good luck.","signature":"8f87e5e7bcea3d87f4e9bb641f183e58fec0260c794846afd3f9bbb10aa4e2bbeeb49bcc338632a57ee7e7b8b4379b37e81a6326df85c44a4d8ab9d36624ac05","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"1","receipt":"2f67f16f6f74809489c1ee51619117c228eb1abf14530652ea9d0d5328cee8a432d8fa6301f7aab448de664ebdd8c15942e97d4be42ab944fa8d1e53e2f0d508","timestamp":1616911820,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
