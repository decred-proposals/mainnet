I am glad to see the same team staying on board, you are all assets for the project.\n\nWhat I would love to see is coordination between our design team and whatever we have as a marketing outfit. Target would be to produce Decred branded collateral. Both design and marketing are beyond my pay-grade or knowledge base however I respect there is an interconnection between the two. I believe Decred needs proactive ideas on how we 'show off' via attractive, professional graphics (which this team is well qualified for) that can readily be shared, this feels like a quick easy win. It could be as simple as taking Decred values (privacy, security, free speech etc) or new/existing product releases distilled into clean social ready collateral items. Open to ideas on this.\n\nWill be a yes from me, good luck.","signature":"8f87e5e7bcea3d87f4e9bb641f183e58fec0260c794846afd3f9bbb10aa4e2bbeeb49bcc338632a57ee7e7b8b4379b37e81a6326df85c44a4d8ab9d36624ac05","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"1","receipt":"2f67f16f6f74809489c1ee51619117c228eb1abf14530652ea9d0d5328cee8a432d8fa6301f7aab448de664ebdd8c15942e97d4be42ab944fa8d1e53e2f0d508","timestamp":1616911820,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I recon bigger marketing efforts should ideally form own team(s) behind it and include designers in those. Similar to Dcr/pi journal. I recall commenting on quite a few marketing related props w/o involving any designers or creatives doing the production.\u2028\n\nBesides some of the baseline visual comms stuff listed here, I don’t see myself \u0026 T8D being overly involved in marketing matters per se. However happy to pitch in on how existing work and methods can be leveraged, as well help out anyone who’s interested working with or on items relating to Decred’s visual comms \u0026 branding.","signature":"734bc400a1d46dd915bed48ec2a9840910f8a222d44d2832c8d122bbc60d3554eab8dd6dd9c24a82cf233e3876696040e7589829b6033137a36f19a6cecbb202","publickey":"f4cb92717d53100564bf80b121817a6ab1dbc6bcbd14523a83f1ef233bb90229","commentid":"2","receipt":"0e25e5b7c6df5bd523ec125069bcc4a83270ff1e9046200c58dcbbbcb04bc37de908a6228c7495b16de2ca7b43d32718e6846114920c2ef93be0e95325ffe006","timestamp":1617572543,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
