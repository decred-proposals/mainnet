While Decrediton is nice, electron leaves a lot to be desired in the areas of installer size, memory footprint, and security, so this is a good alternative to pursue.\n\nI also support sponsorship of gio as a project, but I think it's important to understand what Decred gets out of it in more detail.  It is common for GUI application code to become a sprawling mess, so it could be very helpful to get input on the godcr code from Elias, e.g. to check that it is architected correctly.  A little bit of proactive input from someone who is familiar with how such code should be written would likely be extremely helpful.  Note that I am not advocating for Elias auditing all the godcr code in detail, but instead giving it a high level overview and pointing out any major architectural issues he sees.\n\nIt would be great if we could get Elias in here to comment on this topic a bit.","signature":"19098da06d44b6c0935814020a87f11750ac4e7a26d67c4a94c62bc6c74b5650364795b3af02aecd252abbdbcdf67f65f4f2c3e3a3a6e306c11292947f5dca04","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"6","receipt":"447a19018b7f056034b61415842ed766c337e21f630d9b03dbb7545a61edb1c33d5044028ca9c11c14e1a6b69fc04e8641113b7124349d0745141edf3a04e801","timestamp":1605103578,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
