While Decrediton is nice, electron leaves a lot to be desired in the areas of installer size, memory footprint, and security, so this is a good alternative to pursue.\n\nI also support sponsorship of gio as a project, but I think it's important to understand what Decred gets out of it in more detail.  It is common for GUI application code to become a sprawling mess, so it could be very helpful to get input on the godcr code from Elias, e.g. to check that it is architected correctly.  A little bit of proactive input from someone who is familiar with how such code should be written would likely be extremely helpful.  Note that I am not advocating for Elias auditing all the godcr code in detail, but instead giving it a high level overview and pointing out any major architectural issues he sees.\n\nIt would be great if we could get Elias in here to comment on this topic a bit.","signature":"19098da06d44b6c0935814020a87f11750ac4e7a26d67c4a94c62bc6c74b5650364795b3af02aecd252abbdbcdf67f65f4f2c3e3a3a6e306c11292947f5dca04","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"6","receipt":"447a19018b7f056034b61415842ed766c337e21f630d9b03dbb7545a61edb1c33d5044028ca9c11c14e1a6b69fc04e8641113b7124349d0745141edf3a04e801","timestamp":1605103578,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Does this budget include design expenses? Asking because these are already claimed by the [design proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/1dc1571) and I would like to avoid confusion we had with translations (where _three_ proposals included DJ translations in their budgets).\n\n\u003e Including the mobile apps in other apps stores\n\nGood to see this. It is important because it will open access to individuals and communities for whom security and privacy are high priority, e.g. CyanogenMod, Lineage OS and other Android derivatives, and [maybe](https://liliputing.com/2020/02/linux-based-postmarketos-may-support-android-apps-thanks-to-anbox-pinephone-librem-5-and-more.html) even postmarketOS. This audience is much smaller than Google Play Store users but I expect to onboard much more sophisticated people from there. A person who deliberately flashes his phone with an alternative OS is more likely to appreciate the goals of Decred.\n\n2\\. Do you have any timeline for getting on F-Droid or running own F-Droid repo?\n\n3\\. Do mobile wallets work with proxies like Tor? Are there plans to test them in that mode, esp. when dcrandroid gets on F-Droid?\n\n4\\. I [asked](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e5c8051d7426a754b3642aa2895839666a360abbdee3c1c1edd56ba152702875/comments/11) this in the GoDCR proposal but the question applies to both.
