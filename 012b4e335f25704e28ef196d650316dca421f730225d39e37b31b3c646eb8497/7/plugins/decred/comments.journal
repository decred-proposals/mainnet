I need to look at results, not at the amount of work performed or what I think about the good people working at Ditto. The only thing that matters, in the end, is results, and after 12 months I think we can begin thinking in terms of results and not just progress. $25k/month paid to Ditto is a significant amount even for DCR's Treasury, and while 17.5k is a nice reduction, it's still very pricey and we need to ask ourselves whether a professional PR firm is (still) worth it. And we all have to be careful about what is promised in this Proposal: like somebody recently quipped on Twitter: *PR/Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves.* \n\n**Full disclosure: I voted 'yes' for Ditto before, but I'll probably vote 'no' this time, and let me explain why, by way of commenting one some of the Proposal text:\n**\n\u003e At a high level, awareness and understanding of Decred has never been higher. From social media to events to media relations, Ditto has led communications efforts on behalf of Decred that have established it as one of the most well-respected (and undervalued) projects in crypto. And it makes sense for the most well established PR firm in this space to be working with one of the most reputable projects!\n\nThe above statement claims two things that seem to contradict each other, namely that DCR awareness has never been higher (because of Ditto) *AND* that Ditto established DCR as \"one of the most [...] undervalued projects\" (in other words, that DCR continues to be as \"undervalued\" as before, or more: keep in mind \"undervaluation\" is a subjective category). How can it be? How can awareness keep increasing and increasing (according to Ditto), without impacting valuation? How come this awareness had no significant impact on any metric: I don't know, wallet downloads, purchases at an exchange, follow on Twitter, etc.? All these things are either stagnating or down.\n\n In the world of crypto markets, still dominated by speculation, the awareness that something is undervalued should result in some buying. Speculators always try to predict the 'next big thing', obviously. So it'd be a miracle if awareness was increasing as much as you claim, with 1 year of price falling vs BTC. You must be proposing a new market hypothesis, the inefficient market hypothesis: awareness of undervaluation is increasing while the price keeps falling.\n\nWell, you then say that because of your work, DCR is now \"well-respected\", but I say it was even before, it was always well-respected, that I can remember. Even \"hardcore\" Bitcoiners made positive comments about Decred devs years ago. OK, respect, awareness - these are both a little bit ... nebulous ... very hard to measure - but what about something more tangible that could serve as evidence of this increase in awareness? Sorry, I repeat myself.\n\nI asked this same question on your previous Proposal (phase 2 I think) and I never got a good response: basically, what I get is you say you are feeling that awareness is increasing, but feelings or anecdotal stories are not sufficient, because there are other people who feel differently, and have different anecdotes, **we need something more tangible and quantifiable.** \n\nPlease be aware I'm not saying \"price should have gone up\". I'm only contesting your claim that you have created an all-time high in awareness. If your only claim was that you managed to get us good media, I wouldn't protest. I'd simply agree with that fact. What makes me suspicious is the narrative you construct in the Proposal: \"we boosted awareness to the max, the foundation has been laid, now it's time for the price to follow.\"\n\n---\n\nIn *Decred in Depth, Ep.11*, apropos this, Liz said (16:04 timestamp, it's on YouTube): *\"This is the most common question we get [...] Number 1 the most obvious measure of success is media coverage [...] Another metric we use is: is Decred mentioned in stories about governance? [...] In the last few month, one of the recent Decred Journal said that Decred Twitter's following has doubled, which is a huge testament [...] another metric I wanna mention, when you at events, do people know about Decred?\"*\n\nSo, you did manage to get us a few good media stories, the WSJ one, the CoinDesk one, and there's another one I cannot recall. That is a thumbs up from me. Yet we still didn't have enough to not be removed from Wikipedia. Not enough quality sources to keep a Wikipedia page. As for the governance thing, ETH is still dominating stories about governance, just as Tezos seem to be dominating the staking and \"upgradeability\" narratives. I know this is hard to change, but you mentioned that as a metric of your success. *\"Twitter followers have doubled\"* is simply **not true**. You probably meant something else (impressions?) - because across all platforms  nr. of followers has stagnated or even fallen. YouTube videos posted on Decred YouTube for instance, sometimes get 30, 50 views, sometimes 100 to 200, rarely 500. This is very low even for crypto. I know you don't publish these, but if it's true that awareness for Decred has never been higher, how can we explain such low viewership? As for your anecdotes/feelings, I talk to many people (DCR and outside of DCR, \"bitcoiners\" etc.) who tell me they don't feel any significant increase in DCR awareness. This is also the complains from many people in the #Trading channel, that they don't feel awareness increasing. So who is right? Feelings/anecdotes are unreliable.\n\nWhat metric should we use, then? I say** the only metric that is objective and hardest to game,** is the exchange rate, say, DCR/BTC, why, simply because it's the one that requires skin in the game, something that should be dear to Decred folks. Sure, one can say \"but there's been a bear market\". To that I say: well, in that case, if it's all up to the market anyway, then why do we need to spend Treasury on all this marketing, if it cannot have any effect on anything anyway? If we all admit \"price action is the best marketing\", then is spending a lot on PR/marketing reasonable? Moreover, some obviously knew how to do it well, some projects were doing excellent even throughout 2019, like Chainlink (no idea how they did it, but I hear it's word-of-mouth marketing, grassroots stuff). And again, I know this is not all on Ditto, actually,  I'm becoming skeptical about spending anything on any kind of PR/marketing at all, if it cannot bring any results: more on this later.\n\n(One note regarding \"grassroots/word-of-mouth\": I cannot go into this too much as it's going to be too long already, but one problem with paying so many people to do marketing/PR/tweet is that it stifles grassroots efforts. People think: if someone is already paid to do it, why should I do it? It creates a 'delegation of work' mindset. In coins that don't have professional PR/marketing, the community feels they need to mobilize. - Nevertheless, many good things happened on crypto twitter re:DCR, but wer mostly started by individuals who are not paid by the Treasury - ie. things that would have happened anyway... these are spontaneous, like the \"buy DCR\" quasi-meme that ignited on Twitter... you cannot force these things. When it comes from users, it's cool; when it comes from a PR or marketing employee, it's \"how do you do, fellow kids?\")\n\n---\n","signature":"b03bfe2f437582e0b994cc8249dedf59e94dbc3b49b8bfa819f1bd3a7fac91e6dd63759a361061d25760eb8e545a00eb12e253c5f8176774ba003737cc73c60c","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"5","receipt":"70fb9e99bc503d253d98277a9ac16e56a1f9e0e8321ac152920ef61017268d39bf01f65be06671466a110d3e49e358fcd0acac4c265633172bedb33f15f2c902","timestamp":1578437643,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

When I was the main moderator of the subreddit, I was told that price discussions must be removed because they are, quote, \"spam\". Later I managed to convince them DCR leadership to allow 1 price thread at a time. If you check other communities, price is discussed often. Like it or not, it's what's on people's minds, what they want to talk about. It's how they measure a project's success (of course more adoption = higher price in coins with limited supplies!) The fact that DCR tried to make price a taboo topic severely stifled community growth. I understand this was partially due to regulatory concerns, still, we were the only ones suppressing price talk. While I understand it can quickly devolve, we still need to address this elephant in the room. The Treasury, and the contractors' salaries, after all, depend on it.\n\nThis is supposed to be a store of value, after all, and not a charity for funding cool projects, art, and interesting ideas. If we constantly lose value vs BTC, it gives potential and current investors less reason to store value in DCR as opposed to BTC. A stakeholder is aware that a lot of value will bleed out via sell pressure coming from contractors, so **we must make sure all the sell pressure we add, does result in a counteracting buy pressure.**\n\nAlthough unfortunately, you chose to mention only USD price. DCR/USD is only a reflection, a shadow, and not the real thing. If BTC went to 100k, DCR would be at $200 or more automatically, without any \"increase in awareness\". \n\nBut consider that many of the stakeholders entered into DCR via BTC (there was no other way until recently) and that most volume actually happens in that pair (DCR/BTC): very little volume outside that pair. So if we look at that, we lost more than 2x (0.0045 -\u003e 0.0021) since you were hired. Again, I'm totally aware that we're in a bear market and that you were not hired to \"pump us\", but is this depressing performance on the market consistent with the claim that awareness is at an all-time high?  OK, enough about price, let's move on\n\n---\n\n\u003eLibra\n\nWe spent resources on placing our comments on Libra in the media. While the comments Jake made were very insightful, it's not the task of a #36 cryptocurrency to comment on some Facebook project that was only interesting to the US/EU regulators and to competing stablecoins. The claim that this somehow benefitted DCR is questionable. I don't see any direct benefit. There could be, very indirectly, like someone thinking: \"hm, this project lead made a really pertinent and insightful comment, so the project he's working on must be interesting and I should check it out\" - it's not impossible, but it's such a long shot and so indirect, that it makes me wonder whether it was money well spent; especially seeing how by now, nobody talks about Libra anymore and it's a completely forgotten topic already.\n\n\u003eThis is the year for Decred!\n\nIt's also the year of the Linux desktop, I can feel it.\n\n\u003eThe foundation has been laid, awareness is high\n\nRepeating \"awareness is high\" doesn't magically make it so! Where's the evidence? \"X amounts of articles/podcasts/videos\" is not proof of awareness increasing, only engagement and positive action is!\n\n\u003e\"**We are confident** the altcoin winter is almost over\"\n\n**Is a PR agency giving us technical analysis of the charts?** And with \"confidence\" even? Well, I don't blame you: lacing your Proposal with some *hopium* is a good marketing move!\nBut what are you basing this claim on? \n\n---\n\nThis is already too long, so to conclude, a **TL;DR version of my opinion**: Ditto has done good, especially when it comes to placing us in some top-level crypto media, but they are not cheap, the price has tanked to almost all-time lows, while some other projects still managed to rise during bear, we didn't. 30% price reduction is nice, and what I really like about your Proposal is that you started to talk about something that was a taboo topic in DCR circles (price): it's something that is on all investors/holders/stakers minds, whether they admit it or not. So articulating this, verbalizing this, is a big plus and shows awareness on your part. Still, I cannot get over the fact that you keep saying how awareness has increased to all-time high yet it's not reflected anywhere (except in feelings and anecdotes). Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves, so I cannot trust your promises or your technical analysis of the markets saying \"alt winter is definitely over\" (lacing Proposal with hopium to increase chances of renewal!), so while I like you guys, I have a hard time believing your promises for the future considering the above. I think from now on, I'll vote only yes for development Proposals. DCR was purely dev focused and no marketing initially, later we pivoted to marketing, even to things like Facebook/Google ads, then a PR agency, then a $300K marketing fund - and we've seen very little to no results in terms of anything measurable, quantifiable, like even a slight increase in metrics (especially in the metric that is hardest to Sybil: price). \n\nNot long ago in a conversation with another stakeholder, referring to us pivoting to marketing, I jokingly remarked that if we are going to \"sell our soul to the devil\", at least we should get something in return for it! In those Faustian stories, the person doing the pact with the devil is always rewarded with riches. But here it's not even that, we sold our soul and got very little in return. Not good enough. So perhaps better to go to our roots and be purely dev-focused again (or at least keep the non-dev expenditures to Education,  like video tutorials, guides, etc.), then we can keep that 'cypherpunk' image which many seem to value still.","signature":"3f0f67cbf7141a61e836ee3475e8122903e7fd2de4e1d3c88cf4b91f5a8a7f5961c3fd4c8485b9a94bb0f4bb69b6648c40663d4b8b75bf3c46fd481427aea501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"6","receipt":"b684995cb2c788978c05e721cfc0ec764d333c7804b459ba2f0c0887f2df3af90fb1b51abd9b30b1305ab4aa463b9e2d1fdce550d6e69f32dc0814d74d5d1101","timestamp":1578437679,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

They are nice people and I have enjoyed working with each of them, but that's not really what's at issue.  If they were all regular contractors being paid regular contractor rates they would have 100% of my support.  However, since we are once again being asked to allocate extraordinary amounts of money to PR the results in my opinion also need to be extraordinary.  So far we have spent USD 300k from the Decred treasury on Ditto and this proposal seeks authorization for another USD 105k.  These are vast sums of money even if we were not constrained in any way.\n\nI'll offer a few broad critiques here and will expand in additional comments (for brevity) if asked to do so.  Before that, I would like to address a few issues in this proposal that put me off and highlight the difficulty of assigning performance metrics to disciplines such as PR or marketing.\n\n1.  The insinuation that the amount of Decred locked in PoS is relevant as a metric for gauging Ditto's success is rather absurd.  That trend was in place long before Ditto was hired.  While things like staking or even hashrate can definitely be influenced by the market's perception, our status has never got to the point where there are unknown new players that seem to be showing up and moving the needle significantly.\n2.  In a similar vein, having our PR firm market to us and make statements like \"Ditto is confident alt winter is close to over\" is equal parts disappointing and scary.  Nobody can forecast this stuff, and trying to blunt the impact of another large spend with a big huff of hopium and the prospect that good times are on the horizon is just straight up manipulative.  Nobody sane expected PR to make \"number go up\", even though I'm sure we'd all be patting ourselves on the back for making great decisions if it would have happened, but price, and more broadly market dynamics should play a roll in how we plan expenditures as that's just prudent.\n3.  There is a decent amount of buzz that has been generated around Decred by various new parties, for example; Chris Burniske, Murad Mahmudov, Checkmate, passages like:\n\"Crypto community and beyond: From Nic Carter to Murad Mahmudov, Decred has sparked the interest of so many people in the crypto community — especially the maxis.  We need to stay in front of these people!\"\nMake it seem as though Ditto has been the driving force behind those wins.  This is misleading in my view, and the notion that so-called \"smart money\" or institutions will have their investment decisions swayed by shrewd PR is in my opinion unrealistic.\n\nThe main value Ditto was supposed to deliver was PR, i.e. greater top tier media exposure.  It's hard to separate the opportunities that would have not come our way had Ditto not been pushing for them versus the stuff that we could have got on our own.  And whilst there has always been a feeling amongst many of us that we are largely ignored, we still did get some top tier media coverage even without professionals backing us.  The big change is that we are now seizing many opportunities that in my view are worthless and only being acted on because we're paying so dearly to have them brought to us.  Credit where credit is due there were some big wins with top tier media, as well as value that was delivered in other areas that I'm often critical of and define as \"scope creep\" e.g. social media work.  While this may have been explicitly authorized by the stakeholders I would implore my peers to consider how this is a slippery slope.  There's no doubt that Ditto is doing a bunch of stuff, however, my rough metric for evaluating the deliverables would be the delta between the quality exposure Ditto brings us versus what we can achieve without them.  Doing random podcasts with minor Twitter celebrities or having pieces published on sites that receive very little traffic is not the stuff we need professionals to capture.\n\nOn a similar tangent, the final topic I'd like to broach is that of community engagement.  I don't have a solution here and this is something that will likely resurface in the future.  My read is that having a class of contractors that are paid an extraordinary amount relative to their peers while delivering results that are decent in some domains and only average in others rightly causes alienation among the community.  If we're asking people to go out and engage, whether it be on Twitter or at real events, and they are doing it as volunteers or as individual contractors while a class of \"managers\" begins to emerge that is likely earning an order of magnitude more than everyone else on an hourly basis, it should be no surprise if people begin to capitulate and develop an expectation that; _Ditto's getting paid ten times more than everyone else, so they should do it._\n\nMy hope is that this doesn't come off as too negative, as I do want to be as constructive as possible.  While I'm obviously not for continuing on the same path we have been traveling I will continue to do my best to support Decred as well as the community and contractors that make it so special, and are the key to our continued growth and success, regardless of the outcome of any specific vote.","signature":"3ed45ccdd109715f55abf9f2aee949a5a4c620fd99b94bd42e003477743971fda1c86ee3b7d7024b6ff0e885f5de0d3e5f32b0d86757124e93aade295442a10e","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"7","receipt":"66bd9d9230586c01a2021228187549ed54b66d6e24739d39d003822ef80feff958332db7695c5566b74e75e98747cd8d7fb0788245fbc2d4b2202a47b1c04e07","timestamp":1578439398,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The reduced fee and commitment to the project is commendable and is appreciated, open source projects require labor of love from all involved. I know that Ditto's work has been professional and it has been a pleasure to work with the team.\n\nI had planned  a longer response however comments from JZ and Praxis have essentially summarised my core position. I agree that Ditto posturing with the success of variety of metrics that, quite frankly, are unlikely to be attributable  to PR is not appropriate. The reality is that on-chain metrics like transaction flows indicate only a minor increase in  investor activity over the past 6 months and I am not convinced it is a result of Decred coverage in Forbes. Personally, I see media coverage in such publications as an extremely low impact outcome, especially when contextualized by the price paid to achieve it. Podcast exposure is more effective however, again, the price does not reflect the reward. Decred should have enough justification for a permanent Wikipedia page, for the total sum paid, this is a serious miss.\n\nI was asked by Ditto what attracted me to the project and it was the fundamentals of the blockchain design itself, rather than any marketing headline. I can't speak for others, but in my time in this market, I have never felt the desire to click on a CoinDesk/Forbes headline. The headline is usually enough and the story is quickly forgotten. My experience with the project is that new conversations and public interest has grown primarily out of people evangelizing the project driven by research and understanding Decred's differentiators (often a technical topic). I have not seen Ditto exploring how to disseminate this high impact information, nor is it reflected in the discussion on 'success metrics'. Price and transactions are the indicators of growth, and for the sum paid, the last 6 months has not been fruitful for either of these.\n\nI do want to highlight that contractors/community who understand the ins and outs of this project are the best positioned evangelists. I would rather see resources diverted to empowering and tooling up stronger messaging coming from those camps.\n\nI very much appreciate the work put in by Ditto and commend their professionalism. However, I believe the value for DCR is a poor ROI based on the markets response over last 6 months, and what I deem to be low impact outcomes (publications etc).\n\n**I was not around for the first Ditto votes but will be voting against this one.**","signature":"ad123877ec8501d31fb8b76296beed0469ac96516951b680601c5e9512b77388c32f5a6cc8add5de93827d369738e80ea622fff5774800cc4857ceb66e9a4707","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"9","receipt":"a0cc8b766896bc26267926cbb77327f58e1b65e241749618ab5d1e07713e8327066e7851a36664385b90ca6cebbda01ad202197fb26fc7850bc05b44145e3f0a","timestamp":1578469086,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You make a lot of good points, which I’ll try to address at a high level here. \n \nWe agree with a lot of what you had to say! We too are mindful of the Treasury, which is why we reduced the retainer. In terms of results, we feel like that’s where we have truly shined. I remember there being some grumbling that Trey was tweeting “client!” when Decred got a piece of coverage. He does that for all our clients, and it’s mainly to spread awareness of the client and celebrate exciting moments. No doubt we are proud of only working with top-tier projects like Decred and want to share that! (Besides, tweeting “client!” would be really crappy marketing. :P) \n \nWe do understand the contradiction: high awareness, undervalued. That doesn’t seem to jive. But I think we can say without a doubt that we achieved heightened awareness in 2019. From WSJ to CoinDesk to Pomp to Laura Shin — the list goes on — we delivered. We have all been calling Decred “undervalued” since we started working with Decred. Is it undervalued in terms of price? Yes! Is it undervalued in terms of reputation? No. But the good news is, this debate isn’t around Ditto’s inability to execute. It’s more about: Does Decred need PR? This debate has been ongoing since before we started working together. But this type of honest discussion is the sign of a healthy community, and we’ve enjoyed being part of it! \n \nWe agree with your thinking around awareness and positive metrics. Here’s a question: Does Decred have data on things like wallets and exchange purchases? We were approached in 2019 by two different institutional companies who wanted to take a position in Decred. Did that happen? We’d love to learn more! \n \nWe are happy to have this discussion, but we just don’t think there’s any debate around an increase in awareness. Just the sheer number of stories Decred got in 2019 and coupled with activating the community online is proof. I recall, before Jake’s interview with Ryan Selkis of Messari, Ryan said it seemed like Decred was everywhere. That was a big moment that put all our work into perspective. In the past year, Decred has been featured in one of the top newspapers in the world, top crypto trades, and the two top podcasts. Respectfully, we increased awareness. Now, our job wasn’t to increase Decred’s Twitter or YouTube following. But more people read about Decred than ever before in 2019, and more community members are participating in external communications. This is something we should celebrate! And credit where it’s due: This wouldn’t have been possible without the community’s help. \n \nAgain, it was a chilly 2019 for alts, so there’s only so much PR can do during these times. We have wondered internally, not just about Decred, but all crypto projects: What if they hadn’t had PR in 2019? What if there was no news on Decred? And we purposely brought up price because it’s something everyone talks about — but in private. By no means do we claim responsibility for higher or lower price, amount staked, or any other price-related metric. Our intention in the “Recap of DCR and Crypto in 2019: Looking at Price During Alt Season” section was to take a bird’s-eye-view and celebrate Decred’s achievements at a high level in 2019 — everybody needs a morale boost right now! \n \nIn terms of “well respected,” we simply meant that we’ve helped Decred and been a partner along the way in 2019 to maintain and grow that respect. \n \nWikipedia wasn’t our job. And our job wasn’t to grow your social media following. When I mentioned the metric on the podcast, I was referring to impressions — so I’ll humbly admit I mistakenly said “followers” instead of “impressions”! The intention was to share a nugget of data that demonstrates the work we have been doing to activate the community. \n \nYes, bigger projects that have been around longer get more coverage than Decred, as we noted in the proposal. I think it’s great that we are having this conversation! It’s not about “where’s our coverage?” It’s about “we want to be mentioned with the bigger projects.” That’s a great goal to have! And look, a lot of ETH news came out at Devcon and will continue to come out because of Vitalik and ETH 2.0. And we want to keep fighting for Decred to get you in these stories! We made a lot of progress in 2019, and we want to continue that in 2020. \n \nUltimately, this comes down to Decred needing to decide if PR is worth it and what you hope to get out of it. In 2019, we wanted to get broad awareness. In 2019, we set out to define what Decred is and have you it own issues like governance. We never set out in 2019 to attach our work to price, and I’m not sure anyone would think PR and price solely correlate. And again, price is a tough conversation to have, but we felt it needed to be discussed — especially for 2020.\n \nIn terms of grassroots, we are hoping to help ignite that movement and make it organic. Decred approved for us in Phase 2 to create a system where members are engaging and on message online. And we have absolutely succeeded at that! We’d like to keep building up that program, with the hope that we hit a tipping point and there’s no need anymore for us to organize.\n \nWe are going to respectfully disagree a little on your social media assessment. Personally, we loved the #DecredDanceChallenge! We recall one community member noting that they’d never seen some of the people participating in the challenge. And we think it’s important that when the community engages online they are all pushing the right message and have the best educational materials readily available. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s the ONLY way to do things, and we don’t think this stops anyone from being organic either. But love the Steve Buccemi quote!\n \nYes, we agree. Price has been a taboo subject, and maybe us bringing it up is why we are seeing a lot of passion in these comments. And that’s good! We know there’s frustration. And it’s why we want to not only talk about price, but also what we can do better or differently in 2020 to put Decred in the best place possible for when the market changes.\n \nWe aren’t technical (and never claimed to be!), but we are optimists. We like to think there are a lot of people in the community who believe that 2019 will set the stage for a strong 2020 and/or 2021. We simply want to be a part of Decred to continue down that path.\n ","signature":"d62f1d57fc0671350544e6573402b8f5f3a272512e7f8b9de1c693e15db148045b6f1a05d4c8fe614609047ca0b0324ae6f7bcd8cea40833d600cd5cac31e700","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"11","receipt":"3f3c097e31d7d901463eac66579c0c1df0cad92b8958623a444cc608aa82aa7ac60f2502e014d505f014980db3d1750a83b236a94f0b2584b184690cc73da605","timestamp":1578509385,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But the truth is: Libra was announced, and Jake got a lot of media coverage! One thing we can say with certainty as PR professionals who work in the media field is that for the first time, the entire WORLD paid attention to crypto. And Decred was in those stories! So, yes, more people read about Decred. That’s part of how we work. When big national news breaks in crypto, we insert our clients into the conversation. And sometimes that interview sparks continued interest from the reporter.\n \nFunny Linux reference! Listen, we are just trying to be optimistic, as we truly feel like we are part of the community. We aren’t here to sell you any bullshit. If we were, we wouldn’t be as ingrained in the community as we are. Leslie, Margaret, Trey, Anastasia, and I are intellectually challenged, excited, and fulfilled by all the conversations we have in Matrix and the work we do out in the field for Decred. Have we hit the bottom? Hopefully. We don’t know. Will this be a better year for alts? Hopefully. We don’t know. There are lots of positive signs for Decred, building off of 2019. But the purpose of our comments was to convey positivity and even rally the community. We want Decred to be excited about 2020! But we know that price has everyone down. \n \nWhen I read the phrase “Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves,” I have a couple thoughts. First, we just aren’t a marketing firm. Ditto has done a good job of establishing itself as an anti-PR firm. We focus on executing (as you can see in the recap), we celebrate our wins, and we move on. We don’t have time or the desire to go around and pursue new crypto business when we’re already working with some of the best projects out there — Decred being one of them. \n \n“You sold your soul”: Okay, sure. And you got a lot for it! Just not a price increase. And as others have noted, PR shouldn’t be solely responsible for price. It’s not a silver bullet. \n \nWhat we’re doing is positioning Decred for the long term. It’s not as tangible as a line of code, but it’s just as important to Decred’s long-term sustainability.

However, IMO this new proposal should provide limited media training as most current community members and contractors have already been trained. There is a need for newcomers, and current members deciding to step in the spotlight, but budget for this service should be scaled down accordingly.\n\n- Decred's messaging, positioning, talking points: Before Ditto, this was a mess. Even if most of us who have been here for a while are really confident in the project and feel strongly about what it represents in the CC space, there was no concerted effort to identify how to translate those feelings to those who don't know about Decred. What we have now is a lot more convenient, concise and usable. However, I feel there's a limit to how much we can realistically refine messaging. Sure it will evolve over time, and I do feel a little upkeep is required as well, but if we change and revise these elements constantly, it will make it difficult to appear consistent in what we try to communicate. From this point I feel like budget on this should be kept to a minimum because once we have the basics in place, everything else can only brings in minimal value for at increasing costs.\n\n-Top tier placements: (I'm considering both articles, conferences or interviews). This is what Decred still lack the most imo and what can brings the most value to Decred from a PR perspective. The issue isn't content,  the community already produces an impressive amount of quality literature and possess a collective knowledge that is just amazing. But we need it to be more visible. We need outlets to take notice to the point they come to us for this content. IMO, if we continue with a PR firm,  this should be priority #1, because I feel there is pretty much nothing else that can be done to bring direct value/visibility to the Project for a PR firm right now.\n\n\n**What I find not valuable in what was delivered in he past:**\n\n- \"Side-effect marketing\" :  For example, quotes from project members in articles unrelated to Decred. This brings 0 direct value to the project and doesn't raise awareness in the public. It does raise awareness of reporters using those quotes in their articles,  but I believe we're paying a high price for this kind of side-effect marketing. If we want to go there, I would prefer if public awareness was the driving force so that that reporters feel they need our viewpoint on these unrelated issues and not the other way around. If we pay and position ourselves for visibility let it be direct visibility. I don't feel we're big enough yet to play the reputation card and expect a return on this \"investment\".\n\n- Social media \u0026 trending : We've had a lot of good hits in social medias lately with decent engagement from the community and people from crypto in general, but I don't feel like Ditto is a driving force for these. Their involvement is at best, on par with comments and initiatives from other (unpaid) members of the community, and I don't feel they have demonstrated their capacity to \"manufacture\" more moments like we've had. So I would leave this out of the proposal, and focus on assisting the community and members when we do get these moments. \n\nTo conclude, Ditto won't end the bear market and they can't move price by themselves regardless of what they say. I don't believe they have direct influence in community involvement and grass-root marketing. so I make the effort to not attribute them merit on these issues and not fault them on it either. However price **IS** important both in how much it affect treasury spending and what should be our priorities for the project.\n\nConsidering the current situation I will be voting no on this proposal at current figures, but I feel a scaled down version of the proposals with basic upkeep on previous work, and a focus on top-tier visibility is what a PR firm would be most useful to us at this very moment and price.","signature":"face1099e5da87afec037473de212e7ab1e2fd5176864801d397bc4577e7ebed83818ca1682eb9b6584948462275755c1a61ef46b247cd0d1c7b7269e5c1e80a","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"14","receipt":"3e8624522936e4682efbd04910dc40d5fc6a1e9b5f6f084a63cbc3ec7af971766da24fe486ee7f5e2aaf3ad563222e89236ab63af63461de09ebfd07d1965d09","timestamp":1578514110,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The main reason I'm active in the cryptocurrency space is because I believe that inefficient legacy organisations should be a thing of the past. The beauty of decentralized networks is that a high school kid with decent meme skills can have more impact than a legacy PR firm billing 17.5k a month. \n\nSecond the results are not there to justify the huge amount of money you guys are asking (over 100k total).

We appreciate the kind words, and the feeling is mutual. Leslie, Margaret, Trey, Anastasia, and I love working with you and the community!\n \nLet me start off by saying we believe the results have been pretty extraordinary. Decred has been featured in the WSJ, CoinDesk, Forbes, Laura Shin, Pomp – the list goes on. Decred has been in mainstream outlets ranging from CNBC to Mashable — not a simple feat. And we achieved even more quality media coverage in Phase 2 than before! So, we do believe we are delivering “results.”\n\nWe pride ourselves on delivering top tier, impactful media coverage. In fact, it differentiates us from the other PR firms that only get their clients tier two and tier three coverage. We know this because those projects end up hiring us! So, we always have our eye on tier one. But you can’t hit homeruns in every at bat. We think of it this way:\n\n**The “air game”**: We handpick the best, most impactful tier-one media opportunities. Feature tier-one stories don’t happen as frequently, but when we achieve them, these articles generate quality, reliable sources of information meaningful to Decred’s target audiences and long-term reputation.\n\n**The “ground game”**: We agree that our focus should be on the impactful media! But in a bear market, it’s also important to maintain a “ground game” of constant coverage, both in podcasts and crypto media to signal Decred’s not going anywhere at a time when fear is high for the ecosystem. As we mentioned in the proposal, the more targeted trades still have a crypto readership, and it’s important for us to keep that audience engaged. By  simultaneously maintaining an air and ground game, we strategically target the big stuff while maintaining a steady drumbeat of coverage elsewhere. \n\nTo address your comment about us insinuating that our work impacted metrics: As I mentioned in my response to praxis, we want to make it very clear that we do not and will never claim responsibility for DCR price, amount staked, or any other price-related metric. PR work is not “coin pumping”. We wrote the “Recap of DCR and Crypto in 2019: Looking at Price During Alt Season” section for the purpose of taking a step back and noting some of Decred’s achievements in 2019. \n \nAnd we do understand what you’re saying, but it shouldn’t impact the vote nor us working together. This conversation should be about the metrics we can use in Phase 3. And jz, we’d like to get your input on this. Are we able to look at exchanges? Transactions? Wallets? Like we mentioned above, CoinShares and Pantera contacted Trey to take positions in Decred. Did that happen?\n \nAs we said above in regards to the market, we are simply being optimistic. We are deep in the crypto universe and aware that price prediction is absurd. So, this was not a technical statement. It was simply us being hopeful for 2020. Here’s the big question: if things do warm up, don’t you want a PR firm to keep Decred at the top of the noise? If prices go up – and this is an honest question – don’t you need someone like Ditto to make sure the media writes about Decred?\n \nI hope you know us well enough to know we’re not manipulative. It’s possible you’re misreading the phrase “From Nic Carter to Murad Mahmudov, Decred has sparked the interest of so many people in the crypto community.” We aren’t taking credit. We are giving Decred credit. We say “**Decred** has sparked the interest…” But, to build off of that existing interest, Trey reached out to Murad on his own during Phase 1 and asked him to do media on Decred’s behalf. So, we did have a hand in leveraging well-known smart money Decred holders. But we never said we are the ones who got them interested.\n\nJz, I’d be curious to know what you think will sway institutions or “smart money?” This is an audience we have targeted in the past and there was no push back from the community. In fact, most of our projects are targeting institutional investors and are using PR to do that. We can only hope the WSJ feature had some impact.\n\nTo your point on community engagement: We agree! Decred doesn’t need managers; it needs doers. When we first started working on community engagement, our goal was to empower the community to evangelize on Decred’s behalf and take over in the long term. And the community is more engaged than it has ever been! In this proposal, we’ve reduced and refined our role to focus primarily on identifying relevant topics and supplying messaging. That was intentional. We believe in the self-sustaining ethos behind Decred and want to ultimately engineer ourselves out of this process. We can act as advisors, but it’s up to the community to take the torch and run with it. \n\nAs for “Ditto doing a bunch of stuff”: That’s not an accurate assessment of what we do. We’re not here to just push papers and chatter in Matrix. Execution is what we’re best at, and we think our results speak for themselves. We’re out in front of the media every single day educating, working with reporters on story ideas, and inserting Decred into conversations. And we have to respectfully disagree that this type of work would have happened without Ditto — we are the best in the business at this, and it happened because of us. Decred hired us a year ago because you wanted media coverage. And then you hired us again for the same reason!\n","signature":"01743fa580949ecf63accc0baed4ab6638d252f0e4093c5b55d04450d49cd2956938d80a801e784435acf1726c15d35eebf19e6767a4e75914a13669b9dcf40b","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"17","receipt":"20395f2122a436c5b7b5138695413310e5d88c2d88ac3f8b61bfcde705668b966d712ee80e6391d6c73940ae261bc306f8443f6c657c2b2b6b35787bf5d0f002","timestamp":1578520896,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think the question, as others have expressed, is whether the types of services Ditto provides are worth the cost moving forward.\n\nFull disclosure, I’m an independent contractor with no real dog in this race; I’ve worked on Ditto-led initiatives here and there (e.g. Twitter campaigns, helping with copy, etc.), but will not be impacted financially by them not renewing (actually could get more money if we shift to funding grassroots initiatives). I’m not friends with any of them. \n\nTo defend Ditto (who I have not spoken to) a little by addressing some criticisms expressed:\n\n**Ditto are marketing themselves in the proposal**\n\nWould you hire a PR firm that didn’t?\n\n**We didn’t get top-tier coverage**\n\nI thought WSJ, CoinDesk, Cointelegraph and other articles were pretty good scores for Decred. jy-p and Akin appearing on Pomp’s podcast, and jz on Unchained, was almost a little surreal for me personally. Those are my favorite podcasts, and finally hearing Decred represented was very legitimizing for me (and others I’m sure).\n\nI also think that Decred is maybe a harder sell than some in the community realize/acknowledge. In the #trading channel, where there tends to be more “real talk”, there's long been a drumbeat of “projected deaded”, “community is dying”, “price going to zero”, and similar comments. It’s gotten increasingly grimmer as the bear market has grinded on. And while there’s a clearly negative bias there, some trolls, etc., I think it does reflect an inconvenient truth that sentiment and excitement around the project has waned in recent months. And not because we weren’t in CoinDesk more. We must be careful not to scapegoat here, lest we lose focus. Comparisons to projects that have thrived in the bear market (Chainlink, Tezos, etc.) are not really applicable, as those projects were hot new projects in trending sectors (oracles, POS smart contracts, DeFi, etc.), usually with well-connected VC investors (fair or not). Other comparable projects are having similar (if not worse) issues. Decred is quality hard money, with proven incentives. I’m not worried about it going anywhere. And I think the market will come around eventually. When it does, top-tier publications will write more about us. I think even if we don’t renew, Ditto has gained us valuable mind share in a good number of reporters. \n\n**Ditto are transactional**\n\nI think everyone understood from the beginning this was a vendor relationship. That said, some of the Ditto people have invested significantly into the project, intellectually and emotionally. It was encouraging to see cryptoleslie (who I have not spoken to) become a contractor. I think she’s a good fit and could deliver value long-term should she continue. \n\nAs for whether it’s worth $17.5k/mo ($105k should the contract go 6 months (and I think it’s safe to say it will if this passes)), I don’t know. If we want to keep executing on getting articles, build out the messaging more, maybe pivot to more social media, then I’d say keeping Ditto is a no brainer. \n\nI also think there is something to the argument some are making that we have already (at large expense) acquired the “assets” we were seeking in the relationship; namely reporter mindshare, foundational messaging, and knowledge and best practices around PR/social media that have been absorbed by existing contractors. Perhaps the marginal benefit moving forward is not worth $17.5k/mo. I don’t think Ditto is “rent seeking”, as some have suggested. But it’s possible they will be paid “rent” accidentally, if they receive more value from the contract than they deliver due to diminishing marginal utility. \n\nThere is also the sell pressure. No PR firm with high operating costs can be expected to HODL a volatile crypto. I myself have to sell most of my DCR to pay bills every month (though I HODL as much as I can). I think the fact that Ditto was willing to be paid in DCR, manage that risk and incur additional operating expenses for it (trading, taxes, etc.), is a valuable service and sign of skin-in-the game. But selling $25k/mo in relatively illiquid markets is going to cause downward pressure on the price. Contractors, on the other hand, often HODL and stake a decent percentage of their pay, depending on their financial situation. \n\nDitto’s main competition here is Decred contractors IMO. For ~$200-300k/mo, contractors output the same amount of work an SF-based startup does for a million or two (maybe more). This is because contractors are generally ideologically aligned and invested long-term. For taking on lower pay and higher volatility, they get to work on something revolutionary, and also get a different type of security in the form of a longer-term reciprocal commitment from the project (which cannot go broke like a typical company with revenues, due to monetary premium (here it will outshine most other non true cryptocurrencies longterm, hot as they may be now)). There are many highly talented, highly educated people that I’m sure would be willing to create engaging content for Decred. It can also get creative and possibly get higher leverage from Twitter and other social media than traditional articles. But I would be curious to know more about Decred’s plans there. Politeia seems like it’s only being used for big budgets, not rewarding smaller projects. And I wonder how much expertise is “in-house”, and how much would leave with Ditto should they not be rehired. \n\nIn any case, it has been a pleasure working with all the Ditto people. I think they’ve done a good job and will continue to do so should the stakeholders renew. But it’s tough to say whether $17.5k/mo is worth it. Curious to see what the stakeholder hivemind decides.

I believe that messaging and social media presence should be squarely the domain of the stakeholder/contributor community, and that by paying Ditto such a high rate it does encourage people to defer or delegate those aspects to Ditto. In my view it will be better for the project if we can handle these aspects \"internally\". Liz asked me for input ahead of the proposal and these were my suggestions for scaling down the proposal. I know Ditto team members don't consider themselves \"external\", but the price tag and the fact that Decred is ultimately the client of an organization which is motivated by retaining this contract make that perception hard to avoid. Comments which come across as exaggerating Ditto's role in successes do not help.\n\nIt has been nice to see more coverage of Decred and podcast appearances over the last year. If you could continue to do whatever you're doing to facilitate that, in the mode of regular Decred contractors (and at equivalent rates of pay), I'd like to see you stick around. $17.5k/month is way too much though, I'd be thinking more like the equivalent of one full-time worker.","signature":"67fdf87ae0dc4f940ba54ef472efb81310a94452997ac72167c5a2a7d91955765ac352839e6387157e77b4b4f024240fd99e6811cf8b8a2435766d7be0873200","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"19","receipt":"ca9004294355f5adff6cd4540d40025c14e84ec7a668e2ea5e8b0449868ca815330dbdf47350f64049a35b92aea85db176f48f5007f20315c5cb6d2216858b02","timestamp":1578539941,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think we share the community’s sentiment when we say you’ve been one of the best recent additions to Decred. It’s been a joy working with you so far! \n \nRegarding the “posturing” comment: As I mentioned in my response to jz, we agree that on-chain metrics can’t be attributed to PR! But we didn’t submit our proposal in a vacuum. We’re at a low point as a market, and we can’t ignore the realities (both good and bad) on the ground. Our intention was to contextualize Decred in a high-level look back over 2019. \n \nAnd we agree: Evangelists like you constitute one of Decred’s most valuable PR assets! Decred has some of the smartest people in crypto in its corner, and the challenge is to bring others in from the sidelines — including those who might be less articulate but willing to learn and participate. That’s exactly why we spent Phase 2 building and curating an Educational Resources Repository, which is in the process of being published (can’t wait for you to see it!). This repo will reduce barriers to entry for newbies by giving them an accessible single place with the best curated resources to learn about Decred and get involved. In turn, the community will have an easy repository of materials (most of them community-made) to share with newbies. Everything Ditto does for Decred is, like Decred, built to last. We want the community to have what it needs to move the project along.\n \nAs for Wikipedia, as we told praxis, our job was never to get Decred an article in Wikipedia. And the truth is, many crypto projects are having issues with Wikipedia because a few influential no-coiners have admin power and are intentionally censoring crypto pages. As we recently found out in the media, Lightning Network is experiencing the same problem. This is a broader issue that Ditto or Decred can’t solve alone. What Ditto can do is generate reputable coverage for Decred — which we’ve done! \n \nAs for media coverage being low impact, again, it is up to the community to decide whether PR is worth it for them, and what they can realistically hope to get out of it. I think it’s important to mention: There’s no question that the media are the gatekeepers to the majority of the crypto community. If we don’t keep the gatekeepers talking about Decred, most of the cryptoverse won’t know DCR exists, let alone why they should buy it or participate in the project. It’s all about steady, month-over-month awareness. \n","signature":"4305338826fa65a1b26d5a474c19f7da3883305da626d7ee3b63a0c5dc0f37c20f0c605f3252656c49e843b2dd2d239d750a344da7c854c69b144371a6829608","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"20","receipt":"f0870a477c990ca5a660d6bfea87166bc10ac62dc51527a4f9d32690d16fe7e52f41622ec7d60fafdccad991d2a6f7d2bd30619a6c96172ef485a14abec9b202","timestamp":1578588478,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I want to give you some major kudos: You were the one responsible for bringing Ditto to the negotiating table in Politeia a year ago. You’ve been our main point of contact and our biggest champion. You’ve spent countless hours strategizing with us in Matrix, on the phone, and on Twitter. We’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly together. And it’s been a fun ride so far!\n \nI think we can all agree that with Ditto, Decred has gained access to tier 1 crypto outlets and mainstream media. That was an important goal, and we’ve continued to meet it, month over month. \n \nWe also agree that our work has set up lots of individual contractors to do things they didn’t have the tools to do before: engaging more productively online, educating newbies, and talking about the project in a way that resonates with various target audiences. What individual contractors **aren't** equipped to do also happens to be one of Ditto’s biggest value-adds (it’s why we exist!) and the reason Decred hired us in the first place: our strong professional connections with the media universe, both inside and outside crypto. And this isn’t just about relationships — it’s about knowing how to sniff out a story, pitch a story, to whom, and when, as well as preparing Decred’s spokespersons for media training to set them up for success. The community’s ability to engage online is a whole different animal from working with a journalist on a story. If the media coverage suddenly goes away tomorrow, the community will feel it.\n","signature":"1176c36a918221447960fa05b35431489c6d91c0ab6bb7f2a51ebc64d6457489034416cbb397c33b302ebcccba23dd7dfa52f995911b232514c92d36d2240b04","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"21","receipt":"7a24b5ef2472514f43ecfc5edd66ae5779e1c843a96730e464f9e1d47cc419d5cba0ca5f011d8e9151571de2e3c95c346c92ebd79d8c2d0f6908a4d5824c6a04","timestamp":1578588615,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A lot of the comments and questions to this proposal aren’t around our work and whether we accomplished what we said we would do. This is more about price and the purpose of PR. And again, the purpose in 2019 was broad awareness. We want to be more specific with our purpose in 2020, and we also want to come down in price to reflect the market and show our commitment to work with Decred as partners.\n \nWe can feel the frustration around price, just like we’ve all felt it (mainly privately) for the last year. So, putting that aside, did Ditto do a great job in 2019? Absolutely! Is the timing of our proposal, coupled with us acknowledging market price, bringing up some passionate conversation? You bet!\n \nWe have strong convictions about what we think Decred needs in 2020, as we outlined in the proposal. But ultimately, it’s up to each community member to decide for themselves whether PR, education, and engagement are priorities. Do we think they are? And do we believe they’ll be imperative to preserving Decred’s seat at the table with the big guys throughout 2020 and into 2021? 100%. \n","signature":"a831ad4aafa3232e7017a7b3626221eb8760fd510d2ca6356a9af87a7fb646a1ec8e1f974ebaf178cc283993a40524dba08217b1bd2042784594f3b1f6043407","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"22","receipt":"aae23fb9ed077e3c895d8ec38cd6425151a362c94f32d019bd99fc473bc2021bbcf9fd02551b6045bffae7c84926ce2bca6f80a882efb394200f727fbee2a303","timestamp":1578588742,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We agree! Trey probably knows this better than anyone as someone who worked at massive legacy PR firms before leaving to found an “anti-PR” firm that focuses on results instead of paper-pushing. I can’t think of a single other PR firm (let alone a high school kid!) with both the connections and the capability to do the media outreach we do, **and** has a former crypto journalist and expert on the team. \n \nYou are right to call attention to PR price and ultimately ask what Decred needs. This is an important conversation to have! And while we’re just as much fans of Twitter and Reddit memes as you are, getting a consistent stream of serious media visibility, and breaking outside the crypto media to mainstream outlets, is a long game and strategic approach that requires skill, longevity, and a team of professionals.\n","signature":"a37d5185fa6ac00d290be6da6fc2f1f7b9b37133e7852c6336dfa086f74d82b79f703d20d805e0cc295818af6bc0cabb4bbbf161ba61e57080783fd886405a06","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"23","receipt":"8eda60648ffd67b2fc8b0a7f68c931f0115d958b9d8591ef8f18d6f4f3c621bad0ed1b498f2cc4c5fe4e83017307dea11461f06844f797de82ad0816be30f50c","timestamp":1578588844,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

These were a centerpiece of our Phase 1 and 2 proposals as we geared up the community to speak to the media and evangelize Decred online. Now that the snowball has picked up momentum, we agree that these efforts can be scaled back, and that’s why in Phase 3 we shift our focus to tier-one media and amplification. \n \nAnd we also agree that the community has written a wealth of quality literature — more so than any other project we’ve worked with! That’s exactly why we created the Educational Resources Repository — a highly curated collection of community materials that’s in the process of being published now. This repo aims to achieve exactly what you said Decred needs: heightened visibility and ease of access for reporters, so that they come to Decred for more. This repo will be the “face” of Decred to newbies looking to get acquainted with the project. And in Phase 3, it’ll be important to maintain and update that repo as new literature comes to the fore. \n \nAs for quotes from project members in mainstream media, we addressed this in our response to praxis, too. But you make a good point that public awareness should be the driving force so that reporters come to us, rather than the other way around. This is 100% true, and that’s been the goal from the start! In the past several months, we’ve had reporters from multiple outlets (especially CoinDesk) come to us requesting Decred’s opinion on matters ranging from governance to the purchase of the .org domain. That’s a direct result of our efforts to get Decred in front of journalists, day in and day out, with insightful opinions on news of the day, as well as Decred-centric news. Getting quotes on non-Decred-related stories has never been our central focus, but it’s an important part of the work we do to associate your name with the topics that are relevant to you. \n \nI’m glad you think the community has been more engaged lately! There’s a reason for that. And you aren’t supposed to feel that Ditto is behind it — that’s the whole point. Decred is a decentralized community, and engagement online should look, feel, and **be** organic. Our job was merely to “herd the cats,” provide training and best practices, and then let the community take the torch and run. Based on your comment, I’d say we’ve been successful! \n \nWhat I takeaway most from your comment is that you see the value of having a media presence for Decred. We're aligned with you on that, and that’s why we’ve both come down in price and narrowed in on media work and some maintenance as our focus for 2020. It’d be our honor to continue this partnership and continue to get Decred in front of the outlets that influence the audiences who need to hear about Decred. \n","signature":"48615e2aff7be50795739be3f03e45838234b292bdefd0bbcc00ad81b14c86638c741b973faa05d995f4623cedb6156d5d4fb55f77c9357511e42bfa6c4fc009","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"24","receipt":"fd115e7a86ec7a279ebd7b17dbe1300a552a69d7acd07038033f59d356b27d4ff9f1db638c383d1b2d177c9d6320ecb4b913998a93c7c9fc60b24283a27d4609","timestamp":1578589037,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You’ve been instrumental in helping facilitate our work to refine Decred’s messaging, media train a bunch of people (yourself included), engage online, and talk to the media. \n \nOur Phase 3 proposal was born out of many conversations with community members, both in public channels and in one-on-one chats. We listen to you and appreciate your feedback. One of the biggest takeaways, which you helped us discover, is that Ditto’s most significant perceived value-add is generating impactful media coverage and keeping Decred in front of journalists day over day, month over month. \n \nWe set up important infrastructure in Phase 1 and 2 around empowering the community to engage online, building a messaging framework from scratch, and media training 12+ community members. With that solid foundation in place, Ditto plans to step back on social and perform a targeted maintenance role. We agree the community is ready to manage this themselves with all the tools in place. That’s why we scaled back the proposal and reduced the retainer by 30%. \n \nKeep in mind: Ditto provides an entire specialized discipline, and results don’t happen overnight! Our work ranges from constantly communicating with the media, to providing relevant background materials, talking points, and post-interview feedback to any spokesperson talking with the media. It also includes synthesizing all the ideas crowdsourced from the community and translating that into consistent messaging, as well as writing and placing content. This isn’t a service that a single contractor could deliver. Generating 9 pieces of coverage a month requires a team effort — and that’s only a fraction of what we do. If it involves external communication, Ditto touches it — and we’re at it every single day making sure Decred is in the conversations that matter. \n","signature":"8d4f6a38213e3ed2a9801ce9d224689c45f8f0a685de044b5bbb43d73e2eed28af5afffc84be3a9ebd2aa2e946ed937e1b671b20576bd0087571053d4700890f","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"26","receipt":"c517ecc7e6a8f14c8b8cf242b22878ebef4d47360c076a0cad98755f165f1a5dc7c3d22da972afc9dbaf24413b1da795adcf747535b16cefc763403db5b1b800","timestamp":1578602567,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We’re glad you found Unchained and Pomp to be exciting and surreal. A lot happens behind the scenes to make those opportunities happen — they’re often months in the making. So when they finally go live, it’s rewarding to see the community’s excitement.\n \nYou make an excellent point: When the market eventually does come around, the media will write about Decred even more than it already is. If we take our foot off the gas now, we’ll lose the momentum we’ve gained, and when the news spikes come, we don’t want Decred to be two steps behind. Our work is about skating to where the puck is going, not where it has been.\n \nThe vendor vs. contractor debate has been brought up a few times. I think the community would agree that the individuals on the Ditto team have integrated deeply into the community. For us, Decred is more than just work — it’s become a hobby and intellectual passion for us, too. As someone who’s worked with multiple crypto projects, for me Decred has become a passion project and the gold standard for what constitutes a truly quality project. For Margaret, Decred was an opportunity to bring extensive PR experience with internet startups and fintech companies to a decentralized project, and help to translate the tech into real-world benefits. For Leslie, it was a reason to even join Ditto in the first place. \n \nYes, we’re doing a job, but we’re also diligent about holding ourselves accountable for the work we do. We believe in the ethos, and that comes through when we speak with the media. We pioneered the bi-weekly updates (and some have told us we’re more transparent than most contractors).\n \nBut you make an important point: How do we ensure Ditto isn’t getting more than we’re putting forth?\n \nWe’d love to do more regular AMAs, similar to the one [Trey and I did mid last year,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8XjAOMX-VM) to hear from the community: Where do you see our biggest value add? What are we doing well? What do you want to see more of? We kind of got away from AMAs in H2 2019, but we found it valuable to understanding what the community wants. If Ditto is generating outstanding results, and in close dialogue with the community about when to pivot and what to double down on, then Decred gets the right priorities carried out (visibility, chiefly!) and Ditto is held accountable. \n \nWe’re here to do a job, but we’re also here to be part of a movement we believe in. \n","signature":"81f41f238ce2c44ef21a160a47c595dafebf4ccc9adf887c57f011024964b135558e18322e9f58a0939eb4c4780293a7de2994aeb393c73a4c66048528902b07","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"27","receipt":"69a9d806d0e004b3689ea12bb9023d7e43f007c4aabe2be45d5519ecb302efd2ab1cd9d8cdae78b5c78e0c40e793b64b07fd8c574425254a2c39bf69e5d3710f","timestamp":1578612055,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A lot of good work has been done but at too high a price and the requested amount for phase 3 while reduced is still is too high relative to the value produced\n2.  Paying Ditto at a  higher rate than individual contributors disincentives contractors from independently contributing and free organic Marketing/PR from everyone else\n3.  A lack of quantifiable and tangible metrics to point to as measures of success have led to everyone having to fall back to personal subjective measures \n4.  There have been a number of low value areas of focus that fall outside the core scope of work, time that would have been better spent elsewhere or not at all\n\nI think a lot of folks have given very good and exhaustive feedback which does not leave much to add.  In my view I think Ditto would be well served to make substantial revisions of the proposed work and requested remuneration that address the concerns I attempted to summarize above and other points made.  \n\nHere are some additional thoughts based on the comments I read thus far that could be helpful:\n\n1. Individual contractors a paid hourly and generally have to justify hours worked by tasks and outputs.  It's easier to assess value if one has greater level of visibility into the hours spent vis a vis outputs.  A blanket monthly budget with little visibility into the hours and effort put into it leave people to make assumptions on  value based on subjective measures  that are often incomplete.  A number of comments from others alluded to this by being open to considering members of the Ditto team as individual contributors.  My only conclusion is that there are aspects of the contractor model in place that would serve Ditto in possibly emulating more closely that may address some of these issues.\n\n2.

Where I refer to price above, I generally refer to Ditto's fee (exception is price and transaction flow as ultimate measure of investor activity). Regarding Wikipedia, I appreciate this was not a mandate, however my comment comes from a position where a 300k spend would ideally have yielded coverage that meets even their archaic standards of two top tier, in house written coverage.\n\nGiven the sentiment in the room is primarily centered around the draw on the treasury, I would be interested to hear what a smaller scale operation from Ditto may look like. Perhaps there is scope and interest for a smaller cohort of the team to maintain market presence just at a reduced draw on the treasury.  \n\nWhilst out of scope of this proposal, perhaps there remains opportunity for the individuals, who are now familiar and well versed with the project, seeking side-gig individual contractor roles. Based on the feedback in the room, I don't believe it necessarily should be a case of farewell if this proposal does not pass, perhaps it just requires a re-arrangement of the cost vs output relationship to suit a budget conscious open source and distributed protocol.","signature":"ec64f03d356c1e973ecd33a8198c336a609ae278171ec16bb9734843547fc1db99ce801e6f69135cad631d8cd7db236e91f1a1872d0c065d8b5074796cd4750b","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"30","receipt":"f16737cdde146166e6119f7bb745a3d6ff3346e0dc56fe6c608bf4fcf1a27210273d12ffa81b44806001afe7292f81d3f35d35b822b4c0eed25c3736ba229405","timestamp":1578661374,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I understand that a single full time contractor would not be able to do everything Ditto currently does, but I think it's about the right \"amount\" of professional PR for the project, if it is focused on the aspects which we need professional PR for (encouraging journalists and podcast producers to cover Decred).\n\n\u003e It also includes synthesizing all the ideas crowdsourced from the community and translating that into consistent messaging, as well as writing and placing content.\n\nMy point is that by paying Ditto $25k it's hard to stop \"synthesizing\" becoming \"controlling\". Long term we need better ways to handle this without centralizing decision-making, so it doesn't make sense to pay so much to have it managed by an external party now. Plus if the messaging is still solid then there isn't much work to be done on that front for now anyway.

I sometimes think that slogans \u0026 bullet points are trite. However, if it becomes the kindling that starts the real conversation, we're all the better for it, as long as we are prepared.\n\nBeing prepared is where Ditto has my confidence. I see us in places we weren't in 2017 or 2018! And frankly, we wouldn't have had those placements without them. It's a snowball \u0026 we just got started. When the next Bull Market rolls around, we need professional representation.\n\nMy concern is to be able to deliver the message in repeatable memorable soundbites. What differentiates us from BTC is substantial. It's what BTC purports to be \u0026 why this revolution started. BTC is failing that campaign. DCR  is meaningfully differentiated. I mean, BTC's governance is a lot like fiat for god sake. Reduce that into a slogan. And then let's have that conversation with Trace Mayer, Adam Back, Andreas, Nick Szabo and the rest of them.\n\nAgain thank you for allowing me to engage. \n\nMadScrilla1","signature":"b3c3a99a1a9725aaff5fa888d1237332fa44aa0ea98ed6215dc11159b8a317a62a87d7870a8572b6ad0963720080feb24f6858c3900aa711ce4f8335a1f86b0e","publickey":"62ae05b8553322e2ef04a7328f27b1b603c02184ace8ddf77658d14788371ab4","commentid":"32","receipt":"ee65a40941bf3afee880e112f700c37fdb2692708c6cfc963790a34c987c5d3af3294f87a4e8f98bc98260c15164c16059466e9e65ecd25548b55184d6e03a02","timestamp":1578681097,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'll go ahead and respond to your question because it's a good one, and others might be wondering, as well. \n \nWe don’t think the community is difficult. We understand you all have a lot invested, and appreciate your honest feedback. This is one of the features of decentralized governance, and after a year in this together with you, we’re used to it and even enjoy it. Healthy debate is always a good thing — and it’s even bled over into Twitter today! It’s exciting to see journalists and influencers interested in (and impressed with) Politeia, and the community taking this opportunity to educate them.\n \nThe significant reduction in price is possible for two key reasons: \n \n- **Scope:** We’ve significantly limited the scope of our work. Whereas the original Phase 3 proposal envisioned continued work on messaging, community empowerment/engagement online, content, and work on the educational resources repository, the updated version focuses solely on media relations. Since multiple community members came to the agreement that Ditto’s biggest perceived value add is media, we listened to them and pared back on everything else. \n- **Number of team members**: In the updated “Who” section, we indicated that the team will consist of Margaret and Leslie, who have been working on Decred over the past year. In the original proposal, we envisioned a team of five: Trey, myself, Anastasia, Leslie, and Margaret. In light of the pared-down scope, it makes sense to reduce the size of the team. Decred will still see the same quality and quantity of media results as before — just reduced work on the “other stuff” like social media, messaging, etc. Decred doesn’t need 5 people to do just media relations. Plus, the community seems to agree that keeping a leaner team will align better with Decred’s ethos of decentralizing work. \n \nBottom line: We’re reducing the price to be commensurate with the scope and team. \n \nWe’ll continue to grow and maintain the relationships we’ve developed with tier-one journalists over the past year on Decred’s behalf, including at CoinDesk, The Block, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, Laura Shin, Pomp, Fortune, Forbes, CNBC, etc. These journalists know Margaret and Leslie well, and they come to us regularly for information, commentary, and stories on Decred and the crypto space more broadly. Plus, Leslie and Margaret are both highly knowledgeable about Decred. I can’t think of a better team to keep the pedal down for Decred into 2020! \n","signature":"233470ca58ef14fb9740283e76ae990b442d3b08763ed264273c98366b90767b814b61e2cb7550f9d7f6847b322e774aa9409c01d7a4855a6a963eec35955100","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"42","receipt":"166ff727ce4f4129f1d64ce2b838c74c31e43f7eae78086d4b79271d45d403f3e081363da76b542484e1431c70534cd75047033924a0d0d5dd0d3b2ecd8d0807","timestamp":1578694208,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The foundational messaging we worked on with the community over the past year made great strides towards establishing these soundbites. It'll be up to the community hivemind to continue evolving that messaging to meet the realities of the market and adapt as Decred's target audiences grow, mature, and change. \n\nIn Phase 3, we would continue targeting media a la Laura Shin and Pomp — the tier ones and impactful coverage that significantly drive the needle on awareness. In Phase 2, podcasts played a key role in spreading the word about Decred. This will continue to be the case in Phase 3. In addition to the crypto-focused trade media, where we'll maintain a steady ground game of coverage, we'll also go after the crypto- and non-crypto mainstream media (e.g. Fortune, Wired, etc.). Both the homeruns and the tier-twos have important roles to play in our media relations campaign for Decred. \n \n\n","signature":"2042b1b8e7c30cc2bb5fa93f4e7aed7bcfb613988a89b9d0861018364bfaed2886ed43e064e024f2826a925c7e01a29a89d4aee3899e06f96ad33e5835e4a408","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"43","receipt":"bb7bc576396ef6ca5a274a5ecc10cd435026cf39b309d289b2dc991aad9ac5b29ce83f84c007120931bb76c78383091daa794424d63f419cbcf552c4691c6505","timestamp":1578695385,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Upon reflection on the commentary Ditto and community have provided both on Politeia and on socials, I can appreciate the breadth of audience that maintaining a reduced media relations presence  can have. Let me please draw stakeholders attention to [the responses to one of Trey Dittos comments](https://twitter.com/treyditto/status/1215430405907677185) which engaged a number of profile level responses indicating that \"Decred is actually unavoidable\".\n\nThe revised scope of works represents a more refined and specialised scope that I feel maximally leverages Dittos skills and experience and puts a fire under the community to pick up the slack. The revised fee is now in a range where I consider it to be fair game and more easily absorbed by the treasury. I will be watching closely as commentary comes in from the rest of the community to finalise my view, however am now of the tendency to vote Aye as the next 6-12 months in the market are likely to be active and maintaining momentum is a sound play.","signature":"135623b86cb19a900e66aea419a9807c8c2e9a81efb04d932cc43485af65f79ca2b4bf84823605bf19c453b01d71b4493dbe444c038edb48ecadcbc56d032c02","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"46","receipt":"12a2aea8c186e97fcc326338759812acf7a3bb7e21e02d7863613a255e9c4a35baee1a5298d96f2c34409413e77876f0d8b9e673957532f17104d24bcc648f08","timestamp":1578732489,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The data indicates to me that Decred NEEDS increased adoption this cycle. Retaining  a strong media presence, coupled with renewed promotion from within feels like a sound bet towards achieving this goal. Please see my rationale and supporting charts that summarise my insights based on observations on-chain:\n\n1) Decred rate of adoption is poor as indicated by stagnant, horizontal trending [transaction flows](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/misc/politeia/ditto_proposal/tx_cnt.png) and [active addresses](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/misc/politeia/ditto_proposal/act_adr.png).\n\n2) New features like Privacy, LN and DEX increase the project fundamental value and saw a bump in investor attention in August 2019. These features are however lost on the market if the project does not shout very loudly and consistently about it. Ditto has proven to be on the pulse and indeed delivered consistent messaging at key moments in 2019.\n\n3) Once holders are on-board with skin-in-the game, [Decred has excellent HODLer retention and high economic bandwidth](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/misc/politeia/ditto_proposal/econ_dens.png), much higher than BTC did at the same age with more DCR flowing on-chain, even outside tickets.\n\nMy conclusion is thus.\n\n- My personal experience and feel for market behaviour has me tending towards expectations of positive market momentum in 2020. It seems a significant opportunity cost to drop PR at the start of a bullish market. This is the time to capitalise on Ditto's experience and work over the past 12 months to keep the momentum going and keep Decred in everyone's ear.\n\n- Decred needs attention and it needs it now, else it risks fading into the background. The project has historically minimised focus on marketing which I believe has been to the projects detriment. Putting our foot on the gas in this early cycle is likely to be the most fruitful. \n\n- Decred has every reason to shine in 2020 and the narratives I foresee dominating the market play into Decreds strengths (Privacy, LN, DEX, Safe Haven, SoV, Sovereignty and Governance). We must shout very loud and very consistently about this in 2020 and Ditto's revised proposal fills a much needed part of that puzzle.\n\n- Ditto has done great work and has revised the cost/scope to meet a fair budget at the request of stakeholders. The revised fee, in my opinion, is very reasonable for the scope and experience offered and we already have a gauge on output which de-risks the contract.\n\n- Once people enter Decred, they tend not to leave. Let's focus on getting them in the door.\n\n2020 is Decreds time to shine. I wish Ditto the best of luck in the vote and welcome any questions or clarifications on the above.\nCheers, CM.","signature":"b7194a4ac55e0aedd8d564f115d4d4e38cc3663e47231bf3468481ee6ffa7ac3fc4587748510c19f81bd6ee510903ea49dc6b3401aa74571cdfa53c4bd82fa0e","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"50","receipt":"1daef82fe087c373182a7538e91f8846b0773f84d3cc63d4abb2ae35a91458d2e5df1fb8a6ebbd9fc73d7e6d5e822d112af84932d6c53f5535da47759155310d","timestamp":1578856969,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It's a statement many projects make about themselves, in an attempt to market themselves as non-marketing focused, which is appealing.\n\nBut Decred is definitely a development-focused project, no doubt about that. Still, \"minimized focus on marketing\" is a questionable statement and depends on who we compare ourselves to.\n\nI'd say Decred has been somewhere in the middle. Not extremely marketing focused, but not ignoring it, either.

There was a time when DCR didn't have professional PR and the world didn't fall apart.\n\n\n","signature":"94bf844f1dbeb813ea6c268b7d354ec60784a05bbcb4eba7418eff4b490e1d416fee482bc7fd82073435c49e31f5202258e5c676cd89f88eaab2798ab6f4220c","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"51","receipt":"b6b1ac67c6f15d9e3bf36a45349099994dbf06afa1e8d12800231e09ebae77bf3e42be914abeceb19a4fc534094f968564b343944e0f96abd0016cfba5045f0b","timestamp":1578864038,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That said, 12 months ago, much of the tech was still being built, Pi was new, no LN, no privacy, its just another blockchain. Now, Decred is a machine and we must shout about that right now.\n\nI have not seen a sizeable enough movement from internally on the marketing front to convince me we are ready to get out of the PR bootstrapping phase. As I mentioned in my first comment here, I never found Decred in the media or on Socials in my whole time in this market. I found it by accident whilst studying on-chain behaviour. That is the state of things. Talking heads in industry are now watching the outcome of this proposal. That is a significant level up.  We need some form of coordinated and focused marketing and PR in this early bull cycle. I am attempting to do my part in the whole mix but this is what the treasury is for, bootstrapping until we carry the torch ourselves. The more people we see yelling about Decred in the wild and the more transactions we see on the move, the smaller the fee we can justify being spent on PR.","signature":"f39ca29244965e3e23b44e7ed8ebc11f5473b912eae623ec1bd5e355111cf11671579f97b1b3f9b75de110b2731b625a437c82823b88d6ec2e5f0ffe8b773f04","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"52","receipt":"853031d815b9c838cc1d8d1154b41cd45d6292dfd442cb8f07de6f7a5093b4cd7805ff70d54399473becf19531773f85a6d3938c57ca1faf6c9b387b0705e208","timestamp":1578901122,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Your statement that “once people enter Decred, they tend not to leave” is a fascinating piece of intel that speaks first and foremost to the quality of the project, and secondarily to the way the community has collectively approached acquainting newbies to Decred. \n \nFor the past year, a big piece of Ditto’s work has been educating outsiders (particularly journalists) in ways that are understandable and resonate, so that these outsiders are entering fully informed and for the right reasons. We’ve found that once journalists learn about Decred, they remain engaged with us and tend to either include Decred in their stories (a good example is the [CoinDesk story Leigh Cuen wrote over the weekend](https://www.coindesk.com/is-bitcoin-in-2020-really-like-the-early-internet), in which she extensively quotes Marco) or write features about Decred down the line. The foundational messaging, which focused on concisely communicating Decred’s value proposition and unique differentiators based on the audience, played a significant role in this process of attracting and educating outsiders. Now, as you mentioned, it’s important to maintain the momentum with the media so that the message stays out there and Decred continues to bring new people in the door. \n \nThanks for your honest feedback throughout this process, as well as for your vote of confidence. \n","signature":"74e792f223f056f299e559132a0df091376543d37480a7e374b2c335d4960e0e2b3b2a89d252fdd61ee26fb52a4b505c2e89f6077730acae206858bbdcf71a0c","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"54","receipt":"2441ecf0eabe9a531723a665e98945968cb722df425fd6c3c06f66c350efd27e8cde05c6082130db9f556449caf059d67043704eeb1871149435a6f301fd5208","timestamp":1578947101,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Praxis, thanks for continuing to engage here! You make a lot of valid points. \n \nIn the original version of the proposal, Ditto had recommended additional work outside of media relations, including continued community empowerment online, work on the educational resources repository, and content. In the community comments that followed, the general consensus was that at this point in the market, the additional work Ditto was proposing should be handled by other community members. In response, we significantly reduced the scope and narrowed our focus to media relations. We strongly believe that media relations shouldn’t be handled on an ad hoc basis. There are a few reasons: \n \n- Media relations are relationship-based. They require day over day, week over week engagement with journalists — and not from a collective group of people, but from individuals who put in the time and resources to develop those relationships. There’s a reason media relations are a full-time job! Over the past year, Ditto has built relationships and trust with dozens of journalists on Decred’s behalf. All of them, from Leigh at CoinDesk to Frank at The Block to Pomp to Jay at Cointelegraph, know to come to Ditto when they need a quote from or want to write a story about Decred. We’re also constantly looking for new outlets and writers who should know about Decred, and are reaching out to introduce the project and discuss story ideas.\n- Media relations are more than just shouting about Decred from the rooftops — they’re about supplying the right story ideas and information to journalists at the right time. Ditto closely follows the news. We know exactly which reporters write about which topics. We know to go to Frank with institutional stories. We know Leigh specializes in international use cases and users. We know Tomio of WSJ is interested in VC and governance. At any given moment, Ditto is having dozens of different conversations with dozens of reporters, as well as identifying opportunities to insert Decred into those conversations. \n \nTo your point about Decred doing just fine without PR before, we agree the world won’t fall apart if Ditto suddenly disappears. But Ditto’s job has never been to keep Decred treading water — it can float by itself! Our value add has been and continues to be strategically and proactively positioning Decred for the long-term so that when the moment comes, Decred is riding the crest of the wave: It’s in all the right conversations, and it’s on everyone’s lips and in everyone’s ears. As I mentioned in another comment, we’ve got to move where the puck is going rather than where it has been. \n","signature":"97fa1f2a7b4ffa6a44c456fd526190d77278f74d65f9b910a6c0f03c8acb0cd1cd85de179afd7f0ebaf28ed54d1da34928721b165a58b5fae96212353aa60900","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"55","receipt":"802e04ba6ae2e319170f92f4988458b6ac2af476a76bc3139d00b2505ec807526e4f599bce8f59984e14a516e940a619575a74c212065f5f55165dd4ec89e00a","timestamp":1578951076,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don’t think I’ve become a master of Politeia debates; we’ve just become so ingrained in the community that it’s second nature for us to have civil and constructive rapport with everyone. :) \n \nAnd I want to point out that for Ditto, these Politeia proposals aren’t a matter of “Oh shoot, let’s scramble to tell the community what we’ve been working on for the past six months so they’ll hire us back!” Informally, we engage with the community daily, if not hourly, and have been extremely transparent in the work we do. Formally, we provide a bi-weekly written report, which some have said sets a high standard for transparency in contractor work. And it’s reassuring to see agreement that Ditto has executed well on its promises. Now, the community simply needs to decide two things: “Does Decred need PR? And how much is it worth to us?”\n \nWhatever the community decides, we sincerely appreciate your support and look forward to continuing the momentum in 2020.

In terms of time spent working on the account by Ditto staff,  would that be decreasing in proportion with the decrease in cost?\n\n$10k/month is still a lot for media placements without the other services. That sum may be merited by excellent performance but as a base rate it seems high. Would you consider making part of the payment contingent on hitting certain targets, if we could come up with those targets? That seems more achievable now that the proposal focuses on media placements, because they are easier to define and count than the other aspects Ditto has been contributing to up until now.","signature":"91f5a839f9046c2d69acfe054b78b9cd81aa6f006839f978cf9d25d5c0672dce79db6462ee2386a23c57fe169b9c8189b265d975b351db693ab03605b1485a08","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"57","receipt":"e15c4472de090a319349935112f64691ee681eaa8f0eadd1d0936aa340ef070221977f845a4109ca62c7505e6665161b5b82d5e33709826b18e2dcebd72bc208","timestamp":1578973335,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Beyond what the stakeholders decide, there is no doubt for me that you are part of Decred's community and that you've proven that you are PR professionals of the highest level. \n\nRegarding the work that you've done over the past year, I think is has been clear that the Ditto team has become part of the community and that you're aligned with Decred's ethos. It is hard to measure the work of public relations/community organising/marketing/networking/business development (as I feel the same over my own work), nonetheless, there were clear efforts from the team that took the project to mayor publications. I also felt excited about JZ with Laura Shin, Jake and Akin with Pomp and reading about Decred on WSJ, Forbes, Coindesk and other big news outlets.\n\nAs a community organiser/marketer/networker/business developer, I also understand how difficult is to translate our work into tangible benefits.

We were equally as excited to see the engagement sparked by the CoinDesk article last weekend! It was certainly interesting to see various projects discussing who ended up being mentioned in the article, with only Decred and a handful of others making the cut. This type of coverage is the result of months of communication with reporters: education, timely responses, interviews, supplying information and statistics, etc. Stories like this don't happen overnight or of their own accord — and the old adage \"out of sight, out of mind\" does apply to media. It's important to keep Decred in front of journalists so they're informed enough to know which conversations it makes sense for Decred to participate in, and intuitively know when to come to us for information. And ultimately, when Decred is part of a story that sparks a heated conversation, that's a good thing for the project's visibility and stature relative to other projects. \n\nTo your point about it taking a year to become comfortable with DCR: Just like integrating into the Decred community, PR is a marathon, not a race! Most people being introduced to Decred for the first time will require several touch points into the project before they feel completely comfortable. It might be a tweet, then an article, then a podcast, then a piece of research by richard-red, then analysis by checkmate. Whatever the case may be — and it's unique to each person — consistent exposure is crucial. \n\n","signature":"b369fae71e7138a2c04f1e585e3489ec6ceb4520fa32a1d8f651b73f1ce7253cb3f0b0fa1187de841e8d4b766e9940d56683d336d1c05c2bb54dc299d126270f","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"71","receipt":"e6a3efd961c422f1ecc2757d2b2786050f8fd5ba660a50709dc158044b13ae230312590663ffabdf8b7abf07ce5556f69b868f39df9cded4a8d34fc20475b706","timestamp":1579048916,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That requires taking a long-term view of how Decred needs to proactively communicate to the media today, next month, and 6 months from now. For us to preserve momentum, we've got to be in front of journalists day after day, month after month on two fronts: the topics that matter to Decred (staking, privacy, store of value, governance, Lightning Network, etc.), and Decred news and announcements.

Legacy PR firms do this (it's part of the reason many of us at Ditto left our other jobs and came to Ditto!). These legacy PR firms nickel and dime their clients, often with few results to show for it. We're focused on results, which means putting in as much time as we need to meet our client’s goals. \n\nWe reduced the price by 60% because we're reducing the scope of our work. A natural byproduct of focusing solely on media relations is that we'll reduce the time we spend on other things (online engagement, educational resources repository, etc.). \n\nPayment by media placement isn't how Ditto works — or any PR agency, for that matter, unless they're pay to play, which is generally frowned upon in the crypto and PR industries. The reality of earned media is that it takes a lot of time and know-how to persuade reporters to write about you, and it’s highly competitive, especially at the top-tier level. Another thing that would make a pay to play model difficult is that you cannot predict ever-shifting news cycles and editorial demands that change by the week, sometimes the day, or even the hour. We do our best to stay on top of these, but we cannot guarantee placements will happen at a given time (that’s why it’s “earned” media!). It sometimes takes months of back and forth follow-up and relationship-building to secure these stories. If we are monetarily incentivized by high quantity of placements, this would be at the expense of quality and not beneficial to Decred over the long-haul. \n\nIn its current form, this proposal is the lowest retainer we've **ever** offered at Ditto. Any PR professional would tell you it's an extremely competitive rate for the services we're offering. That's especially true because the community already knows what we're capable of: high-quality results, month after month. We've proven ourselves for the past year and are ready to continue doing so.","signature":"6bdcc404b3945588846e11d4c21b22b1f6806f0d1548a0cfe7a032b5a6d73649bc5d2b8f614d1d6ad8ccc027d4dce7a139811fe370abc7a2216ba3e7116a2609","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"75","receipt":"c4e3a54f1d5c9cb0e3c5fd11bc042e911bf1e2842ea8ed4964e784d312e56479d69a0ac468068c067f0a9504a84984621184d0a0fbfb635232c760d741f0910b","timestamp":1579050794,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

While I generally value development more than PR, media, hype, etc. I am certain there needs to be more awareness of Decred.  Far more.  Ditto is in the best position to do this for us.\n\nIf you take a big step back from crypto, you will find almost no one outside of the industry who is aware of Decred.  That's no surprise as most people don't know about Litecoin (not that LTC is at all relevant anymore), but when people do take the plunge there needs to be solid and recent coverage of Decred so we show up in their research.  And it **really** must be ongoing.  News gets stale pretty quickly.\n\nWhich leads to Wikipedia.   If someone new to cryptocurrencies wants to learn more, you can bet they'll look to Wikipedia for the high level view.  Not only is their no Decred page, we're not even listed on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies where you'll find Potcoin, Titcoin, EOS, Stellar, etc.  Just what does it take to have a Wikipedia page?  Sources apparently, and motivation to advocate for Decred and fight the trolls there.  Can we please make this happen?","signature":"ab75cf7e2ac821219ad3f05d10bde2334f3bac46d356d6f27f002d4e8be3be6835c7c53d67b08c793c84cd6f7dfc6250f512ddda53c5df94b8d4399b05749804","publickey":"22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","commentid":"78","receipt":"690be45e6e6c71861b2d76d4442d13dc418b2e39e4838eab961db8c9b0d923eebda5ec53f3f52b87b651b6fb6fb7fa1f54ed0fff55736fbcbbe59f4ce1947a0c","timestamp":1579132497,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
