Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred: Phase 3

**Summary**

The proposal below is an edited version of the original Phase 3 proposal Ditto submitted on January 7, 2020. It addresses comments from the community, which called for a reduction in the scope and cost of Ditto’s services to both accommodate market realities and focus on areas where Ditto’s services are considered to be most valuable. 

At a high level, this proposal contains two major changes: 

1. We scaled back our services to focus on media relations
2. We reduced the retainer by 60% to $10,000 equivalent in DCR per month.

**Quick Recap of Ditto’s Work Over the Past Year**

Below is a high-level summary of our results for Phase 2 (our results for Phase 1 are in our [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04)):

**What**

Ditto is proposing a media relations campaign that continues the work we did for the past year. At a high level, we want to continue to drive broad awareness of Decred and its unique value proposition and ensure that when topics like governance and privacy are written about that Decred is mentioned alongside other projects. 

We are happy to answer any questions in response to the community’s feedback.

**Why**

The crypto conversation significantly matured in 2019, and Decred was an important part of discussions around decentralized governance, store of value, staking and privacy - to name a few. Many reporters knew instinctively that Decred should be part of their stories, and they contacted Ditto for quotes, commentary, and information. Others still needed Ditto keeping in front of them as a constant reminder. 

So, why does Decred need PR? And why should Ditto be your PR firm?

There are a few reasons:
- There’s still work to be done. More people need to know what Decred is.
- You need to remain top-of-mind. From devs to investors, we want Decred to be top-of-mind when any audience is looking for a project to work on or invest in.
- Future preparation. We don’t know what will happen in 2020, but if we do see a new wave of enthusiasts get into crypto, we want Decred to be best positioned to take advantage of that wave. 

But competition will only heat up. The crypto space will continue to consolidate around an ever-shrinking pool of big names, and Decred will need to be smart and aggressive about keeping its (rightfully deserved) seat at that table. 

So, why Ditto? 

We’ve been a partner to Decred for a whole year. We’re completely integrated into the Decred community. We have a deep understanding of Decred and a daily (if not hourly!) rapport with dozens of community members. With our fingers on the pulse of the media landscape, we’re uniquely positioned between journalists and the community to keep Decred in front of the media day after day. We’re transparent, and as our bi-weekly updates show, we’re able to regularly deliver impactful results. 

**How**

Ditto will focus its efforts on generating month-over-month, high-quality media coverage.  

***Focusing on Tier-One Outlets***

We are going to keep doing what you’ve hired us twice to do! We will hand pick the highest-quality, most impactful media opportunities in tier-one crypto media (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, The Block, etc.) — including podcasts — to ensure that Decred is securing feature coverage around releases and moments of importance to the project. We will also pursue tier-one non-crypto media outlets (Bloomberg, CNBC, Cheddar, Nasdaq, etc.). 

***Broad awareness on topics that matter***

We need to be vigilant about solidifying Decred’s association with important topics like privacy, security, store of value, Lightning Network, DAO, etc. That means keeping the project in front of reporters, day after day, with smart commentary and insight — and that includes relevant announcements. 

And while our focus will be on high-tier, high-impact media coverage, it’s especially important in a bear market not to lose sight of the role that consistent crypto trade coverage plays in keeping Decred top-of-mind and in a positive light. Non-tier-one trades still have a broad crypto readership, many of whom are DCR holders. It’s important we keep them abreast of the good work Decred is doing, to preserve its foothold on the awareness earned over the past year. This will require staying in front of crypto journalists consistently to ensure Decred is heard in conversations around staking, governance, store of value, treasury spending, DAOs, etc. 

**Who**

Margaret Huang and Leslie Ankney (aka Crypto Leslie, who wrote two feature stories on Decred when she worked for Forbes, prior to joining Ditto), who have worked closely with the Decred community over the past year, will serve as the Ditto team for Decred. 

**When and How Much**

A year ago, Ditto fought to win Decred’s business because we believed in the project. We agreed to getting paid in DCR, and we reduced the price based on the community’s feedback.

Fast forward one year, and we didn’t realize how meaningful our partnership would become. This has become as much about Decred’s long-term sustainability as it is about our retainer. This bear market is a test of the Decred/Ditto relationship. We earnestly want to stick it out with you and help you emerge in an even stronger position. For us to endure this bear market together, we understand that we need to reduce our price and scope.

Ditto proposes another 6-month contract. We propose a monthly budget of $10,000 equivalent in DCR for the above services to be rendered. This is a 60% reduction in price from the previous 6 months of work together. 

We are ready to keep going, if you’ll have us!
