I need to look at results, not at the amount of work performed or what I think about the good people working at Ditto. The only thing that matters, in the end, is results, and after 12 months I think we can begin thinking in terms of results and not just progress. $25k/month paid to Ditto is a significant amount even for DCR's Treasury, and while 17.5k is a nice reduction, it's still very pricey and we need to ask ourselves whether a professional PR firm is (still) worth it. And we all have to be careful about what is promised in this Proposal: like somebody recently quipped on Twitter: *PR/Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves.* \n\n**Full disclosure: I voted 'yes' for Ditto before, but I'll probably vote 'no' this time, and let me explain why, by way of commenting one some of the Proposal text:\n**\n\u003e At a high level, awareness and understanding of Decred has never been higher. From social media to events to media relations, Ditto has led communications efforts on behalf of Decred that have established it as one of the most well-respected (and undervalued) projects in crypto. And it makes sense for the most well established PR firm in this space to be working with one of the most reputable projects!\n\nThe above statement claims two things that seem to contradict each other, namely that DCR awareness has never been higher (because of Ditto) *AND* that Ditto established DCR as \"one of the most [...] undervalued projects\" (in other words, that DCR continues to be as \"undervalued\" as before, or more: keep in mind \"undervaluation\" is a subjective category). How can it be? How can awareness keep increasing and increasing (according to Ditto), without impacting valuation? How come this awareness had no significant impact on any metric: I don't know, wallet downloads, purchases at an exchange, follow on Twitter, etc.? All these things are either stagnating or down.\n\n In the world of crypto markets, still dominated by speculation, the awareness that something is undervalued should result in some buying. Speculators always try to predict the 'next big thing', obviously. So it'd be a miracle if awareness was increasing as much as you claim, with 1 year of price falling vs BTC. You must be proposing a new market hypothesis, the inefficient market hypothesis: awareness of undervaluation is increasing while the price keeps falling.\n\nWell, you then say that because of your work, DCR is now \"well-respected\", but I say it was even before, it was always well-respected, that I can remember. Even \"hardcore\" Bitcoiners made positive comments about Decred devs years ago. OK, respect, awareness - these are both a little bit ... nebulous ... very hard to measure - but what about something more tangible that could serve as evidence of this increase in awareness? Sorry, I repeat myself.\n\nI asked this same question on your previous Proposal (phase 2 I think) and I never got a good response: basically, what I get is you say you are feeling that awareness is increasing, but feelings or anecdotal stories are not sufficient, because there are other people who feel differently, and have different anecdotes, **we need something more tangible and quantifiable.** \n\nPlease be aware I'm not saying \"price should have gone up\". I'm only contesting your claim that you have created an all-time high in awareness. If your only claim was that you managed to get us good media, I wouldn't protest. I'd simply agree with that fact. What makes me suspicious is the narrative you construct in the Proposal: \"we boosted awareness to the max, the foundation has been laid, now it's time for the price to follow.\"\n\n---\n\nIn *Decred in Depth, Ep.11*, apropos this, Liz said (16:04 timestamp, it's on YouTube): *\"This is the most common question we get [...] Number 1 the most obvious measure of success is media coverage [...] Another metric we use is: is Decred mentioned in stories about governance? [...] In the last few month, one of the recent Decred Journal said that Decred Twitter's following has doubled, which is a huge testament [...] another metric I wanna mention, when you at events, do people know about Decred?\"*\n\nSo, you did manage to get us a few good media stories, the WSJ one, the CoinDesk one, and there's another one I cannot recall. That is a thumbs up from me. Yet we still didn't have enough to not be removed from Wikipedia. Not enough quality sources to keep a Wikipedia page. As for the governance thing, ETH is still dominating stories about governance, just as Tezos seem to be dominating the staking and \"upgradeability\" narratives. I know this is hard to change, but you mentioned that as a metric of your success. *\"Twitter followers have doubled\"* is simply **not true**. You probably meant something else (impressions?) - because across all platforms  nr. of followers has stagnated or even fallen. YouTube videos posted on Decred YouTube for instance, sometimes get 30, 50 views, sometimes 100 to 200, rarely 500. This is very low even for crypto. I know you don't publish these, but if it's true that awareness for Decred has never been higher, how can we explain such low viewership? As for your anecdotes/feelings, I talk to many people (DCR and outside of DCR, \"bitcoiners\" etc.) who tell me they don't feel any significant increase in DCR awareness. This is also the complains from many people in the #Trading channel, that they don't feel awareness increasing. So who is right? Feelings/anecdotes are unreliable.\n\nWhat metric should we use, then? I say** the only metric that is objective and hardest to game,** is the exchange rate, say, DCR/BTC, why, simply because it's the one that requires skin in the game, something that should be dear to Decred folks. Sure, one can say \"but there's been a bear market\". To that I say: well, in that case, if it's all up to the market anyway, then why do we need to spend Treasury on all this marketing, if it cannot have any effect on anything anyway? If we all admit \"price action is the best marketing\", then is spending a lot on PR/marketing reasonable? Moreover, some obviously knew how to do it well, some projects were doing excellent even throughout 2019, like Chainlink (no idea how they did it, but I hear it's word-of-mouth marketing, grassroots stuff). And again, I know this is not all on Ditto, actually,  I'm becoming skeptical about spending anything on any kind of PR/marketing at all, if it cannot bring any results: more on this later.\n\n(One note regarding \"grassroots/word-of-mouth\": I cannot go into this too much as it's going to be too long already, but one problem with paying so many people to do marketing/PR/tweet is that it stifles grassroots efforts. People think: if someone is already paid to do it, why should I do it? It creates a 'delegation of work' mindset. In coins that don't have professional PR/marketing, the community feels they need to mobilize. - Nevertheless, many good things happened on crypto twitter re:DCR, but wer mostly started by individuals who are not paid by the Treasury - ie. things that would have happened anyway... these are spontaneous, like the \"buy DCR\" quasi-meme that ignited on Twitter... you cannot force these things. When it comes from users, it's cool; when it comes from a PR or marketing employee, it's \"how do you do, fellow kids?\")\n\n---\n","signature":"b03bfe2f437582e0b994cc8249dedf59e94dbc3b49b8bfa819f1bd3a7fac91e6dd63759a361061d25760eb8e545a00eb12e253c5f8176774ba003737cc73c60c","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"5","receipt":"70fb9e99bc503d253d98277a9ac16e56a1f9e0e8321ac152920ef61017268d39bf01f65be06671466a110d3e49e358fcd0acac4c265633172bedb33f15f2c902","timestamp":1578437643,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

When I was the main moderator of the subreddit, I was told that price discussions must be removed because they are, quote, \"spam\". Later I managed to convince them DCR leadership to allow 1 price thread at a time. If you check other communities, price is discussed often. Like it or not, it's what's on people's minds, what they want to talk about. It's how they measure a project's success (of course more adoption = higher price in coins with limited supplies!) The fact that DCR tried to make price a taboo topic severely stifled community growth. I understand this was partially due to regulatory concerns, still, we were the only ones suppressing price talk. While I understand it can quickly devolve, we still need to address this elephant in the room. The Treasury, and the contractors' salaries, after all, depend on it.\n\nThis is supposed to be a store of value, after all, and not a charity for funding cool projects, art, and interesting ideas. If we constantly lose value vs BTC, it gives potential and current investors less reason to store value in DCR as opposed to BTC. A stakeholder is aware that a lot of value will bleed out via sell pressure coming from contractors, so **we must make sure all the sell pressure we add, does result in a counteracting buy pressure.**\n\nAlthough unfortunately, you chose to mention only USD price. DCR/USD is only a reflection, a shadow, and not the real thing. If BTC went to 100k, DCR would be at $200 or more automatically, without any \"increase in awareness\". \n\nBut consider that many of the stakeholders entered into DCR via BTC (there was no other way until recently) and that most volume actually happens in that pair (DCR/BTC): very little volume outside that pair. So if we look at that, we lost more than 2x (0.0045 -\u003e 0.0021) since you were hired. Again, I'm totally aware that we're in a bear market and that you were not hired to \"pump us\", but is this depressing performance on the market consistent with the claim that awareness is at an all-time high?  OK, enough about price, let's move on\n\n---\n\n\u003eLibra\n\nWe spent resources on placing our comments on Libra in the media. While the comments Jake made were very insightful, it's not the task of a #36 cryptocurrency to comment on some Facebook project that was only interesting to the US/EU regulators and to competing stablecoins. The claim that this somehow benefitted DCR is questionable. I don't see any direct benefit. There could be, very indirectly, like someone thinking: \"hm, this project lead made a really pertinent and insightful comment, so the project he's working on must be interesting and I should check it out\" - it's not impossible, but it's such a long shot and so indirect, that it makes me wonder whether it was money well spent; especially seeing how by now, nobody talks about Libra anymore and it's a completely forgotten topic already.\n\n\u003eThis is the year for Decred!\n\nIt's also the year of the Linux desktop, I can feel it.\n\n\u003eThe foundation has been laid, awareness is high\n\nRepeating \"awareness is high\" doesn't magically make it so! Where's the evidence? \"X amounts of articles/podcasts/videos\" is not proof of awareness increasing, only engagement and positive action is!\n\n\u003e\"**We are confident** the altcoin winter is almost over\"\n\n**Is a PR agency giving us technical analysis of the charts?** And with \"confidence\" even? Well, I don't blame you: lacing your Proposal with some *hopium* is a good marketing move!\nBut what are you basing this claim on? \n\n---\n\nThis is already too long, so to conclude, a **TL;DR version of my opinion**: Ditto has done good, especially when it comes to placing us in some top-level crypto media, but they are not cheap, the price has tanked to almost all-time lows, while some other projects still managed to rise during bear, we didn't. 30% price reduction is nice, and what I really like about your Proposal is that you started to talk about something that was a taboo topic in DCR circles (price): it's something that is on all investors/holders/stakers minds, whether they admit it or not. So articulating this, verbalizing this, is a big plus and shows awareness on your part. Still, I cannot get over the fact that you keep saying how awareness has increased to all-time high yet it's not reflected anywhere (except in feelings and anecdotes). Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves, so I cannot trust your promises or your technical analysis of the markets saying \"alt winter is definitely over\" (lacing Proposal with hopium to increase chances of renewal!), so while I like you guys, I have a hard time believing your promises for the future considering the above. I think from now on, I'll vote only yes for development Proposals. DCR was purely dev focused and no marketing initially, later we pivoted to marketing, even to things like Facebook/Google ads, then a PR agency, then a $300K marketing fund - and we've seen very little to no results in terms of anything measurable, quantifiable, like even a slight increase in metrics (especially in the metric that is hardest to Sybil: price). \n\nNot long ago in a conversation with another stakeholder, referring to us pivoting to marketing, I jokingly remarked that if we are going to \"sell our soul to the devil\", at least we should get something in return for it! In those Faustian stories, the person doing the pact with the devil is always rewarded with riches. But here it's not even that, we sold our soul and got very little in return. Not good enough. So perhaps better to go to our roots and be purely dev-focused again (or at least keep the non-dev expenditures to Education,  like video tutorials, guides, etc.), then we can keep that 'cypherpunk' image which many seem to value still.","signature":"3f0f67cbf7141a61e836ee3475e8122903e7fd2de4e1d3c88cf4b91f5a8a7f5961c3fd4c8485b9a94bb0f4bb69b6648c40663d4b8b75bf3c46fd481427aea501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"6","receipt":"b684995cb2c788978c05e721cfc0ec764d333c7804b459ba2f0c0887f2df3af90fb1b51abd9b30b1305ab4aa463b9e2d1fdce550d6e69f32dc0814d74d5d1101","timestamp":1578437679,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

They are nice people and I have enjoyed working with each of them, but that's not really what's at issue.  If they were all regular contractors being paid regular contractor rates they would have 100% of my support.  However, since we are once again being asked to allocate extraordinary amounts of money to PR the results in my opinion also need to be extraordinary.  So far we have spent USD 300k from the Decred treasury on Ditto and this proposal seeks authorization for another USD 105k.  These are vast sums of money even if we were not constrained in any way.\n\nI'll offer a few broad critiques here and will expand in additional comments (for brevity) if asked to do so.  Before that, I would like to address a few issues in this proposal that put me off and highlight the difficulty of assigning performance metrics to disciplines such as PR or marketing.\n\n1.  The insinuation that the amount of Decred locked in PoS is relevant as a metric for gauging Ditto's success is rather absurd.  That trend was in place long before Ditto was hired.  While things like staking or even hashrate can definitely be influenced by the market's perception, our status has never got to the point where there are unknown new players that seem to be showing up and moving the needle significantly.\n2.  In a similar vein, having our PR firm market to us and make statements like \"Ditto is confident alt winter is close to over\" is equal parts disappointing and scary.  Nobody can forecast this stuff, and trying to blunt the impact of another large spend with a big huff of hopium and the prospect that good times are on the horizon is just straight up manipulative.  Nobody sane expected PR to make \"number go up\", even though I'm sure we'd all be patting ourselves on the back for making great decisions if it would have happened, but price, and more broadly market dynamics should play a roll in how we plan expenditures as that's just prudent.\n3.  There is a decent amount of buzz that has been generated around Decred by various new parties, for example; Chris Burniske, Murad Mahmudov, Checkmate, passages like:\n\"Crypto community and beyond: From Nic Carter to Murad Mahmudov, Decred has sparked the interest of so many people in the crypto community — especially the maxis.  We need to stay in front of these people!\"\nMake it seem as though Ditto has been the driving force behind those wins.  This is misleading in my view, and the notion that so-called \"smart money\" or institutions will have their investment decisions swayed by shrewd PR is in my opinion unrealistic.\n\nThe main value Ditto was supposed to deliver was PR, i.e. greater top tier media exposure.  It's hard to separate the opportunities that would have not come our way had Ditto not been pushing for them versus the stuff that we could have got on our own.  And whilst there has always been a feeling amongst many of us that we are largely ignored, we still did get some top tier media coverage even without professionals backing us.  The big change is that we are now seizing many opportunities that in my view are worthless and only being acted on because we're paying so dearly to have them brought to us.  Credit where credit is due there were some big wins with top tier media, as well as value that was delivered in other areas that I'm often critical of and define as \"scope creep\" e.g. social media work.  While this may have been explicitly authorized by the stakeholders I would implore my peers to consider how this is a slippery slope.  There's no doubt that Ditto is doing a bunch of stuff, however, my rough metric for evaluating the deliverables would be the delta between the quality exposure Ditto brings us versus what we can achieve without them.  Doing random podcasts with minor Twitter celebrities or having pieces published on sites that receive very little traffic is not the stuff we need professionals to capture.\n\nOn a similar tangent, the final topic I'd like to broach is that of community engagement.  I don't have a solution here and this is something that will likely resurface in the future.  My read is that having a class of contractors that are paid an extraordinary amount relative to their peers while delivering results that are decent in some domains and only average in others rightly causes alienation among the community.  If we're asking people to go out and engage, whether it be on Twitter or at real events, and they are doing it as volunteers or as individual contractors while a class of \"managers\" begins to emerge that is likely earning an order of magnitude more than everyone else on an hourly basis, it should be no surprise if people begin to capitulate and develop an expectation that; _Ditto's getting paid ten times more than everyone else, so they should do it._\n\nMy hope is that this doesn't come off as too negative, as I do want to be as constructive as possible.  While I'm obviously not for continuing on the same path we have been traveling I will continue to do my best to support Decred as well as the community and contractors that make it so special, and are the key to our continued growth and success, regardless of the outcome of any specific vote.","signature":"3ed45ccdd109715f55abf9f2aee949a5a4c620fd99b94bd42e003477743971fda1c86ee3b7d7024b6ff0e885f5de0d3e5f32b0d86757124e93aade295442a10e","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"7","receipt":"66bd9d9230586c01a2021228187549ed54b66d6e24739d39d003822ef80feff958332db7695c5566b74e75e98747cd8d7fb0788245fbc2d4b2202a47b1c04e07","timestamp":1578439398,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The reduced fee and commitment to the project is commendable and is appreciated, open source projects require labor of love from all involved. I know that Ditto's work has been professional and it has been a pleasure to work with the team.\n\nI had planned  a longer response however comments from JZ and Praxis have essentially summarised my core position. I agree that Ditto posturing with the success of variety of metrics that, quite frankly, are unlikely to be attributable  to PR is not appropriate. The reality is that on-chain metrics like transaction flows indicate only a minor increase in  investor activity over the past 6 months and I am not convinced it is a result of Decred coverage in Forbes. Personally, I see media coverage in such publications as an extremely low impact outcome, especially when contextualized by the price paid to achieve it. Podcast exposure is more effective however, again, the price does not reflect the reward. Decred should have enough justification for a permanent Wikipedia page, for the total sum paid, this is a serious miss.\n\nI was asked by Ditto what attracted me to the project and it was the fundamentals of the blockchain design itself, rather than any marketing headline. I can't speak for others, but in my time in this market, I have never felt the desire to click on a CoinDesk/Forbes headline. The headline is usually enough and the story is quickly forgotten. My experience with the project is that new conversations and public interest has grown primarily out of people evangelizing the project driven by research and understanding Decred's differentiators (often a technical topic). I have not seen Ditto exploring how to disseminate this high impact information, nor is it reflected in the discussion on 'success metrics'. Price and transactions are the indicators of growth, and for the sum paid, the last 6 months has not been fruitful for either of these.\n\nI do want to highlight that contractors/community who understand the ins and outs of this project are the best positioned evangelists. I would rather see resources diverted to empowering and tooling up stronger messaging coming from those camps.\n\nI very much appreciate the work put in by Ditto and commend their professionalism. However, I believe the value for DCR is a poor ROI based on the markets response over last 6 months, and what I deem to be low impact outcomes (publications etc).\n\n**I was not around for the first Ditto votes but will be voting against this one.**","signature":"ad123877ec8501d31fb8b76296beed0469ac96516951b680601c5e9512b77388c32f5a6cc8add5de93827d369738e80ea622fff5774800cc4857ceb66e9a4707","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"9","receipt":"a0cc8b766896bc26267926cbb77327f58e1b65e241749618ab5d1e07713e8327066e7851a36664385b90ca6cebbda01ad202197fb26fc7850bc05b44145e3f0a","timestamp":1578469086,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You make a lot of good points, which I’ll try to address at a high level here. \n \nWe agree with a lot of what you had to say! We too are mindful of the Treasury, which is why we reduced the retainer. In terms of results, we feel like that’s where we have truly shined. I remember there being some grumbling that Trey was tweeting “client!” when Decred got a piece of coverage. He does that for all our clients, and it’s mainly to spread awareness of the client and celebrate exciting moments. No doubt we are proud of only working with top-tier projects like Decred and want to share that! (Besides, tweeting “client!” would be really crappy marketing. :P) \n \nWe do understand the contradiction: high awareness, undervalued. That doesn’t seem to jive. But I think we can say without a doubt that we achieved heightened awareness in 2019. From WSJ to CoinDesk to Pomp to Laura Shin — the list goes on — we delivered. We have all been calling Decred “undervalued” since we started working with Decred. Is it undervalued in terms of price? Yes! Is it undervalued in terms of reputation? No. But the good news is, this debate isn’t around Ditto’s inability to execute. It’s more about: Does Decred need PR? This debate has been ongoing since before we started working together. But this type of honest discussion is the sign of a healthy community, and we’ve enjoyed being part of it! \n \nWe agree with your thinking around awareness and positive metrics. Here’s a question: Does Decred have data on things like wallets and exchange purchases? We were approached in 2019 by two different institutional companies who wanted to take a position in Decred. Did that happen? We’d love to learn more! \n \nWe are happy to have this discussion, but we just don’t think there’s any debate around an increase in awareness. Just the sheer number of stories Decred got in 2019 and coupled with activating the community online is proof. I recall, before Jake’s interview with Ryan Selkis of Messari, Ryan said it seemed like Decred was everywhere. That was a big moment that put all our work into perspective. In the past year, Decred has been featured in one of the top newspapers in the world, top crypto trades, and the two top podcasts. Respectfully, we increased awareness. Now, our job wasn’t to increase Decred’s Twitter or YouTube following. But more people read about Decred than ever before in 2019, and more community members are participating in external communications. This is something we should celebrate! And credit where it’s due: This wouldn’t have been possible without the community’s help. \n \nAgain, it was a chilly 2019 for alts, so there’s only so much PR can do during these times. We have wondered internally, not just about Decred, but all crypto projects: What if they hadn’t had PR in 2019? What if there was no news on Decred? And we purposely brought up price because it’s something everyone talks about — but in private. By no means do we claim responsibility for higher or lower price, amount staked, or any other price-related metric. Our intention in the “Recap of DCR and Crypto in 2019: Looking at Price During Alt Season” section was to take a bird’s-eye-view and celebrate Decred’s achievements at a high level in 2019 — everybody needs a morale boost right now! \n \nIn terms of “well respected,” we simply meant that we’ve helped Decred and been a partner along the way in 2019 to maintain and grow that respect. \n \nWikipedia wasn’t our job. And our job wasn’t to grow your social media following. When I mentioned the metric on the podcast, I was referring to impressions — so I’ll humbly admit I mistakenly said “followers” instead of “impressions”! The intention was to share a nugget of data that demonstrates the work we have been doing to activate the community. \n \nYes, bigger projects that have been around longer get more coverage than Decred, as we noted in the proposal. I think it’s great that we are having this conversation! It’s not about “where’s our coverage?” It’s about “we want to be mentioned with the bigger projects.” That’s a great goal to have! And look, a lot of ETH news came out at Devcon and will continue to come out because of Vitalik and ETH 2.0. And we want to keep fighting for Decred to get you in these stories! We made a lot of progress in 2019, and we want to continue that in 2020. \n \nUltimately, this comes down to Decred needing to decide if PR is worth it and what you hope to get out of it. In 2019, we wanted to get broad awareness. In 2019, we set out to define what Decred is and have you it own issues like governance. We never set out in 2019 to attach our work to price, and I’m not sure anyone would think PR and price solely correlate. And again, price is a tough conversation to have, but we felt it needed to be discussed — especially for 2020.\n \nIn terms of grassroots, we are hoping to help ignite that movement and make it organic. Decred approved for us in Phase 2 to create a system where members are engaging and on message online. And we have absolutely succeeded at that! We’d like to keep building up that program, with the hope that we hit a tipping point and there’s no need anymore for us to organize.\n \nWe are going to respectfully disagree a little on your social media assessment. Personally, we loved the #DecredDanceChallenge! We recall one community member noting that they’d never seen some of the people participating in the challenge. And we think it’s important that when the community engages online they are all pushing the right message and have the best educational materials readily available. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s the ONLY way to do things, and we don’t think this stops anyone from being organic either. But love the Steve Buccemi quote!\n \nYes, we agree. Price has been a taboo subject, and maybe us bringing it up is why we are seeing a lot of passion in these comments. And that’s good! We know there’s frustration. And it’s why we want to not only talk about price, but also what we can do better or differently in 2020 to put Decred in the best place possible for when the market changes.\n \nWe aren’t technical (and never claimed to be!), but we are optimists. We like to think there are a lot of people in the community who believe that 2019 will set the stage for a strong 2020 and/or 2021. We simply want to be a part of Decred to continue down that path.\n ","signature":"d62f1d57fc0671350544e6573402b8f5f3a272512e7f8b9de1c693e15db148045b6f1a05d4c8fe614609047ca0b0324ae6f7bcd8cea40833d600cd5cac31e700","publickey":"c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","commentid":"11","receipt":"3f3c097e31d7d901463eac66579c0c1df0cad92b8958623a444cc608aa82aa7ac60f2502e014d505f014980db3d1750a83b236a94f0b2584b184690cc73da605","timestamp":1578509385,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But the truth is: Libra was announced, and Jake got a lot of media coverage! One thing we can say with certainty as PR professionals who work in the media field is that for the first time, the entire WORLD paid attention to crypto. And Decred was in those stories! So, yes, more people read about Decred. That’s part of how we work. When big national news breaks in crypto, we insert our clients into the conversation. And sometimes that interview sparks continued interest from the reporter.\n \nFunny Linux reference! Listen, we are just trying to be optimistic, as we truly feel like we are part of the community. We aren’t here to sell you any bullshit. If we were, we wouldn’t be as ingrained in the community as we are. Leslie, Margaret, Trey, Anastasia, and I are intellectually challenged, excited, and fulfilled by all the conversations we have in Matrix and the work we do out in the field for Decred. Have we hit the bottom? Hopefully. We don’t know. Will this be a better year for alts? Hopefully. We don’t know. There are lots of positive signs for Decred, building off of 2019. But the purpose of our comments was to convey positivity and even rally the community. We want Decred to be excited about 2020! But we know that price has everyone down. \n \nWhen I read the phrase “Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves,” I have a couple thoughts. First, we just aren’t a marketing firm. Ditto has done a good job of establishing itself as an anti-PR firm. We focus on executing (as you can see in the recap), we celebrate our wins, and we move on. We don’t have time or the desire to go around and pursue new crypto business when we’re already working with some of the best projects out there — Decred being one of them. \n \n“You sold your soul”: Okay, sure. And you got a lot for it! Just not a price increase. And as others have noted, PR shouldn’t be solely responsible for price. It’s not a silver bullet. \n \nWhat we’re doing is positioning Decred for the long term. It’s not as tangible as a line of code, but it’s just as important to Decred’s long-term sustainability.

However, IMO this new proposal should provide limited media training as most current community members and contractors have already been trained. There is a need for newcomers, and current members deciding to step in the spotlight, but budget for this service should be scaled down accordingly.\n\n- Decred's messaging, positioning, talking points: Before Ditto, this was a mess. Even if most of us who have been here for a while are really confident in the project and feel strongly about what it represents in the CC space, there was no concerted effort to identify how to translate those feelings to those who don't know about Decred. What we have now is a lot more convenient, concise and usable. However, I feel there's a limit to how much we can realistically refine messaging. Sure it will evolve over time, and I do feel a little upkeep is required as well, but if we change and revise these elements constantly, it will make it difficult to appear consistent in what we try to communicate. From this point I feel like budget on this should be kept to a minimum because once we have the basics in place, everything else can only brings in minimal value for at increasing costs.\n\n-Top tier placements: (I'm considering both articles, conferences or interviews). This is what Decred still lack the most imo and what can brings the most value to Decred from a PR perspective. The issue isn't content,  the community already produces an impressive amount of quality literature and possess a collective knowledge that is just amazing. But we need it to be more visible. We need outlets to take notice to the point they come to us for this content. IMO, if we continue with a PR firm,  this should be priority #1, because I feel there is pretty much nothing else that can be done to bring direct value/visibility to the Project for a PR firm right now.\n\n\n**What I find not valuable in what was delivered in he past:**\n\n- \"Side-effect marketing\" :  For example, quotes from project members in articles unrelated to Decred. This brings 0 direct value to the project and doesn't raise awareness in the public. It does raise awareness of reporters using those quotes in their articles,  but I believe we're paying a high price for this kind of side-effect marketing. If we want to go there, I would prefer if public awareness was the driving force so that that reporters feel they need our viewpoint on these unrelated issues and not the other way around. If we pay and position ourselves for visibility let it be direct visibility. I don't feel we're big enough yet to play the reputation card and expect a return on this \"investment\".\n\n- Social media \u0026 trending : We've had a lot of good hits in social medias lately with decent engagement from the community and people from crypto in general, but I don't feel like Ditto is a driving force for these. Their involvement is at best, on par with comments and initiatives from other (unpaid) members of the community, and I don't feel they have demonstrated their capacity to \"manufacture\" more moments like we've had. So I would leave this out of the proposal, and focus on assisting the community and members when we do get these moments. \n\nTo conclude, Ditto won't end the bear market and they can't move price by themselves regardless of what they say. I don't believe they have direct influence in community involvement and grass-root marketing. so I make the effort to not attribute them merit on these issues and not fault them on it either. However price **IS** important both in how much it affect treasury spending and what should be our priorities for the project.\n\nConsidering the current situation I will be voting no on this proposal at current figures, but I feel a scaled down version of the proposals with basic upkeep on previous work, and a focus on top-tier visibility is what a PR firm would be most useful to us at this very moment and price.","signature":"face1099e5da87afec037473de212e7ab1e2fd5176864801d397bc4577e7ebed83818ca1682eb9b6584948462275755c1a61ef46b247cd0d1c7b7269e5c1e80a","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"14","receipt":"3e8624522936e4682efbd04910dc40d5fc6a1e9b5f6f084a63cbc3ec7af971766da24fe486ee7f5e2aaf3ad563222e89236ab63af63461de09ebfd07d1965d09","timestamp":1578514110,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The main reason I'm active in the cryptocurrency space is because I believe that inefficient legacy organisations should be a thing of the past. The beauty of decentralized networks is that a high school kid with decent meme skills can have more impact than a legacy PR firm billing 17.5k a month. \n\nSecond the results are not there to justify the huge amount of money you guys are asking (over 100k total).
