I need to look at results, not at the amount of work performed or what I think about the good people working at Ditto. The only thing that matters, in the end, is results, and after 12 months I think we can begin thinking in terms of results and not just progress. $25k/month paid to Ditto is a significant amount even for DCR's Treasury, and while 17.5k is a nice reduction, it's still very pricey and we need to ask ourselves whether a professional PR firm is (still) worth it. And we all have to be careful about what is promised in this Proposal: like somebody recently quipped on Twitter: *PR/Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves.* \n\n**Full disclosure: I voted 'yes' for Ditto before, but I'll probably vote 'no' this time, and let me explain why, by way of commenting one some of the Proposal text:\n**\n\u003e At a high level, awareness and understanding of Decred has never been higher. From social media to events to media relations, Ditto has led communications efforts on behalf of Decred that have established it as one of the most well-respected (and undervalued) projects in crypto. And it makes sense for the most well established PR firm in this space to be working with one of the most reputable projects!\n\nThe above statement claims two things that seem to contradict each other, namely that DCR awareness has never been higher (because of Ditto) *AND* that Ditto established DCR as \"one of the most [...] undervalued projects\" (in other words, that DCR continues to be as \"undervalued\" as before, or more: keep in mind \"undervaluation\" is a subjective category). How can it be? How can awareness keep increasing and increasing (according to Ditto), without impacting valuation? How come this awareness had no significant impact on any metric: I don't know, wallet downloads, purchases at an exchange, follow on Twitter, etc.? All these things are either stagnating or down.\n\n In the world of crypto markets, still dominated by speculation, the awareness that something is undervalued should result in some buying. Speculators always try to predict the 'next big thing', obviously. So it'd be a miracle if awareness was increasing as much as you claim, with 1 year of price falling vs BTC. You must be proposing a new market hypothesis, the inefficient market hypothesis: awareness of undervaluation is increasing while the price keeps falling.\n\nWell, you then say that because of your work, DCR is now \"well-respected\", but I say it was even before, it was always well-respected, that I can remember. Even \"hardcore\" Bitcoiners made positive comments about Decred devs years ago. OK, respect, awareness - these are both a little bit ... nebulous ... very hard to measure - but what about something more tangible that could serve as evidence of this increase in awareness? Sorry, I repeat myself.\n\nI asked this same question on your previous Proposal (phase 2 I think) and I never got a good response: basically, what I get is you say you are feeling that awareness is increasing, but feelings or anecdotal stories are not sufficient, because there are other people who feel differently, and have different anecdotes, **we need something more tangible and quantifiable.** \n\nPlease be aware I'm not saying \"price should have gone up\". I'm only contesting your claim that you have created an all-time high in awareness. If your only claim was that you managed to get us good media, I wouldn't protest. I'd simply agree with that fact. What makes me suspicious is the narrative you construct in the Proposal: \"we boosted awareness to the max, the foundation has been laid, now it's time for the price to follow.\"\n\n---\n\nIn *Decred in Depth, Ep.11*, apropos this, Liz said (16:04 timestamp, it's on YouTube): *\"This is the most common question we get [...] Number 1 the most obvious measure of success is media coverage [...] Another metric we use is: is Decred mentioned in stories about governance? [...] In the last few month, one of the recent Decred Journal said that Decred Twitter's following has doubled, which is a huge testament [...] another metric I wanna mention, when you at events, do people know about Decred?\"*\n\nSo, you did manage to get us a few good media stories, the WSJ one, the CoinDesk one, and there's another one I cannot recall. That is a thumbs up from me. Yet we still didn't have enough to not be removed from Wikipedia. Not enough quality sources to keep a Wikipedia page. As for the governance thing, ETH is still dominating stories about governance, just as Tezos seem to be dominating the staking and \"upgradeability\" narratives. I know this is hard to change, but you mentioned that as a metric of your success. *\"Twitter followers have doubled\"* is simply **not true**. You probably meant something else (impressions?) - because across all platforms  nr. of followers has stagnated or even fallen. YouTube videos posted on Decred YouTube for instance, sometimes get 30, 50 views, sometimes 100 to 200, rarely 500. This is very low even for crypto. I know you don't publish these, but if it's true that awareness for Decred has never been higher, how can we explain such low viewership? As for your anecdotes/feelings, I talk to many people (DCR and outside of DCR, \"bitcoiners\" etc.) who tell me they don't feel any significant increase in DCR awareness. This is also the complains from many people in the #Trading channel, that they don't feel awareness increasing. So who is right? Feelings/anecdotes are unreliable.\n\nWhat metric should we use, then? I say** the only metric that is objective and hardest to game,** is the exchange rate, say, DCR/BTC, why, simply because it's the one that requires skin in the game, something that should be dear to Decred folks. Sure, one can say \"but there's been a bear market\". To that I say: well, in that case, if it's all up to the market anyway, then why do we need to spend Treasury on all this marketing, if it cannot have any effect on anything anyway? If we all admit \"price action is the best marketing\", then is spending a lot on PR/marketing reasonable? Moreover, some obviously knew how to do it well, some projects were doing excellent even throughout 2019, like Chainlink (no idea how they did it, but I hear it's word-of-mouth marketing, grassroots stuff). And again, I know this is not all on Ditto, actually,  I'm becoming skeptical about spending anything on any kind of PR/marketing at all, if it cannot bring any results: more on this later.\n\n(One note regarding \"grassroots/word-of-mouth\": I cannot go into this too much as it's going to be too long already, but one problem with paying so many people to do marketing/PR/tweet is that it stifles grassroots efforts. People think: if someone is already paid to do it, why should I do it? It creates a 'delegation of work' mindset. In coins that don't have professional PR/marketing, the community feels they need to mobilize. - Nevertheless, many good things happened on crypto twitter re:DCR, but wer mostly started by individuals who are not paid by the Treasury - ie. things that would have happened anyway... these are spontaneous, like the \"buy DCR\" quasi-meme that ignited on Twitter... you cannot force these things. When it comes from users, it's cool; when it comes from a PR or marketing employee, it's \"how do you do, fellow kids?\")\n\n---\n","signature":"b03bfe2f437582e0b994cc8249dedf59e94dbc3b49b8bfa819f1bd3a7fac91e6dd63759a361061d25760eb8e545a00eb12e253c5f8176774ba003737cc73c60c","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"5","receipt":"70fb9e99bc503d253d98277a9ac16e56a1f9e0e8321ac152920ef61017268d39bf01f65be06671466a110d3e49e358fcd0acac4c265633172bedb33f15f2c902","timestamp":1578437643,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

When I was the main moderator of the subreddit, I was told that price discussions must be removed because they are, quote, \"spam\". Later I managed to convince them DCR leadership to allow 1 price thread at a time. If you check other communities, price is discussed often. Like it or not, it's what's on people's minds, what they want to talk about. It's how they measure a project's success (of course more adoption = higher price in coins with limited supplies!) The fact that DCR tried to make price a taboo topic severely stifled community growth. I understand this was partially due to regulatory concerns, still, we were the only ones suppressing price talk. While I understand it can quickly devolve, we still need to address this elephant in the room. The Treasury, and the contractors' salaries, after all, depend on it.\n\nThis is supposed to be a store of value, after all, and not a charity for funding cool projects, art, and interesting ideas. If we constantly lose value vs BTC, it gives potential and current investors less reason to store value in DCR as opposed to BTC. A stakeholder is aware that a lot of value will bleed out via sell pressure coming from contractors, so **we must make sure all the sell pressure we add, does result in a counteracting buy pressure.**\n\nAlthough unfortunately, you chose to mention only USD price. DCR/USD is only a reflection, a shadow, and not the real thing. If BTC went to 100k, DCR would be at $200 or more automatically, without any \"increase in awareness\". \n\nBut consider that many of the stakeholders entered into DCR via BTC (there was no other way until recently) and that most volume actually happens in that pair (DCR/BTC): very little volume outside that pair. So if we look at that, we lost more than 2x (0.0045 -\u003e 0.0021) since you were hired. Again, I'm totally aware that we're in a bear market and that you were not hired to \"pump us\", but is this depressing performance on the market consistent with the claim that awareness is at an all-time high?  OK, enough about price, let's move on\n\n---\n\n\u003eLibra\n\nWe spent resources on placing our comments on Libra in the media. While the comments Jake made were very insightful, it's not the task of a #36 cryptocurrency to comment on some Facebook project that was only interesting to the US/EU regulators and to competing stablecoins. The claim that this somehow benefitted DCR is questionable. I don't see any direct benefit. There could be, very indirectly, like someone thinking: \"hm, this project lead made a really pertinent and insightful comment, so the project he's working on must be interesting and I should check it out\" - it's not impossible, but it's such a long shot and so indirect, that it makes me wonder whether it was money well spent; especially seeing how by now, nobody talks about Libra anymore and it's a completely forgotten topic already.\n\n\u003eThis is the year for Decred!\n\nIt's also the year of the Linux desktop, I can feel it.\n\n\u003eThe foundation has been laid, awareness is high\n\nRepeating \"awareness is high\" doesn't magically make it so! Where's the evidence? \"X amounts of articles/podcasts/videos\" is not proof of awareness increasing, only engagement and positive action is!\n\n\u003e\"**We are confident** the altcoin winter is almost over\"\n\n**Is a PR agency giving us technical analysis of the charts?** And with \"confidence\" even? Well, I don't blame you: lacing your Proposal with some *hopium* is a good marketing move!\nBut what are you basing this claim on? \n\n---\n\nThis is already too long, so to conclude, a **TL;DR version of my opinion**: Ditto has done good, especially when it comes to placing us in some top-level crypto media, but they are not cheap, the price has tanked to almost all-time lows, while some other projects still managed to rise during bear, we didn't. 30% price reduction is nice, and what I really like about your Proposal is that you started to talk about something that was a taboo topic in DCR circles (price): it's something that is on all investors/holders/stakers minds, whether they admit it or not. So articulating this, verbalizing this, is a big plus and shows awareness on your part. Still, I cannot get over the fact that you keep saying how awareness has increased to all-time high yet it's not reflected anywhere (except in feelings and anecdotes). Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves, so I cannot trust your promises or your technical analysis of the markets saying \"alt winter is definitely over\" (lacing Proposal with hopium to increase chances of renewal!), so while I like you guys, I have a hard time believing your promises for the future considering the above. I think from now on, I'll vote only yes for development Proposals. DCR was purely dev focused and no marketing initially, later we pivoted to marketing, even to things like Facebook/Google ads, then a PR agency, then a $300K marketing fund - and we've seen very little to no results in terms of anything measurable, quantifiable, like even a slight increase in metrics (especially in the metric that is hardest to Sybil: price). \n\nNot long ago in a conversation with another stakeholder, referring to us pivoting to marketing, I jokingly remarked that if we are going to \"sell our soul to the devil\", at least we should get something in return for it! In those Faustian stories, the person doing the pact with the devil is always rewarded with riches. But here it's not even that, we sold our soul and got very little in return. Not good enough. So perhaps better to go to our roots and be purely dev-focused again (or at least keep the non-dev expenditures to Education,  like video tutorials, guides, etc.), then we can keep that 'cypherpunk' image which many seem to value still.","signature":"3f0f67cbf7141a61e836ee3475e8122903e7fd2de4e1d3c88cf4b91f5a8a7f5961c3fd4c8485b9a94bb0f4bb69b6648c40663d4b8b75bf3c46fd481427aea501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"6","receipt":"b684995cb2c788978c05e721cfc0ec764d333c7804b459ba2f0c0887f2df3af90fb1b51abd9b30b1305ab4aa463b9e2d1fdce550d6e69f32dc0814d74d5d1101","timestamp":1578437679,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
