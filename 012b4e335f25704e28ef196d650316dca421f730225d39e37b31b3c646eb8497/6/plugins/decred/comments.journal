I need to look at results, not at the amount of work performed or what I think about the good people working at Ditto. The only thing that matters, in the end, is results, and after 12 months I think we can begin thinking in terms of results and not just progress. $25k/month paid to Ditto is a significant amount even for DCR's Treasury, and while 17.5k is a nice reduction, it's still very pricey and we need to ask ourselves whether a professional PR firm is (still) worth it. And we all have to be careful about what is promised in this Proposal: like somebody recently quipped on Twitter: *PR/Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves.* \n\n**Full disclosure: I voted 'yes' for Ditto before, but I'll probably vote 'no' this time, and let me explain why, by way of commenting one some of the Proposal text:\n**\n\u003e At a high level, awareness and understanding of Decred has never been higher. From social media to events to media relations, Ditto has led communications efforts on behalf of Decred that have established it as one of the most well-respected (and undervalued) projects in crypto. And it makes sense for the most well established PR firm in this space to be working with one of the most reputable projects!\n\nThe above statement claims two things that seem to contradict each other, namely that DCR awareness has never been higher (because of Ditto) *AND* that Ditto established DCR as \"one of the most [...] undervalued projects\" (in other words, that DCR continues to be as \"undervalued\" as before, or more: keep in mind \"undervaluation\" is a subjective category). How can it be? How can awareness keep increasing and increasing (according to Ditto), without impacting valuation? How come this awareness had no significant impact on any metric: I don't know, wallet downloads, purchases at an exchange, follow on Twitter, etc.? All these things are either stagnating or down.\n\n In the world of crypto markets, still dominated by speculation, the awareness that something is undervalued should result in some buying. Speculators always try to predict the 'next big thing', obviously. So it'd be a miracle if awareness was increasing as much as you claim, with 1 year of price falling vs BTC. You must be proposing a new market hypothesis, the inefficient market hypothesis: awareness of undervaluation is increasing while the price keeps falling.\n\nWell, you then say that because of your work, DCR is now \"well-respected\", but I say it was even before, it was always well-respected, that I can remember. Even \"hardcore\" Bitcoiners made positive comments about Decred devs years ago. OK, respect, awareness - these are both a little bit ... nebulous ... very hard to measure - but what about something more tangible that could serve as evidence of this increase in awareness? Sorry, I repeat myself.\n\nI asked this same question on your previous Proposal (phase 2 I think) and I never got a good response: basically, what I get is you say you are feeling that awareness is increasing, but feelings or anecdotal stories are not sufficient, because there are other people who feel differently, and have different anecdotes, **we need something more tangible and quantifiable.** \n\nPlease be aware I'm not saying \"price should have gone up\". I'm only contesting your claim that you have created an all-time high in awareness. If your only claim was that you managed to get us good media, I wouldn't protest. I'd simply agree with that fact. What makes me suspicious is the narrative you construct in the Proposal: \"we boosted awareness to the max, the foundation has been laid, now it's time for the price to follow.\"\n\n---\n\nIn *Decred in Depth, Ep.11*, apropos this, Liz said (16:04 timestamp, it's on YouTube): *\"This is the most common question we get [...] Number 1 the most obvious measure of success is media coverage [...] Another metric we use is: is Decred mentioned in stories about governance? [...] In the last few month, one of the recent Decred Journal said that Decred Twitter's following has doubled, which is a huge testament [...] another metric I wanna mention, when you at events, do people know about Decred?\"*\n\nSo, you did manage to get us a few good media stories, the WSJ one, the CoinDesk one, and there's another one I cannot recall. That is a thumbs up from me. Yet we still didn't have enough to not be removed from Wikipedia. Not enough quality sources to keep a Wikipedia page. As for the governance thing, ETH is still dominating stories about governance, just as Tezos seem to be dominating the staking and \"upgradeability\" narratives. I know this is hard to change, but you mentioned that as a metric of your success. *\"Twitter followers have doubled\"* is simply **not true**. You probably meant something else (impressions?) - because across all platforms  nr. of followers has stagnated or even fallen. YouTube videos posted on Decred YouTube for instance, sometimes get 30, 50 views, sometimes 100 to 200, rarely 500. This is very low even for crypto. I know you don't publish these, but if it's true that awareness for Decred has never been higher, how can we explain such low viewership? As for your anecdotes/feelings, I talk to many people (DCR and outside of DCR, \"bitcoiners\" etc.) who tell me they don't feel any significant increase in DCR awareness. This is also the complains from many people in the #Trading channel, that they don't feel awareness increasing. So who is right? Feelings/anecdotes are unreliable.\n\nWhat metric should we use, then? I say** the only metric that is objective and hardest to game,** is the exchange rate, say, DCR/BTC, why, simply because it's the one that requires skin in the game, something that should be dear to Decred folks. Sure, one can say \"but there's been a bear market\". To that I say: well, in that case, if it's all up to the market anyway, then why do we need to spend Treasury on all this marketing, if it cannot have any effect on anything anyway? If we all admit \"price action is the best marketing\", then is spending a lot on PR/marketing reasonable? Moreover, some obviously knew how to do it well, some projects were doing excellent even throughout 2019, like Chainlink (no idea how they did it, but I hear it's word-of-mouth marketing, grassroots stuff). And again, I know this is not all on Ditto, actually,  I'm becoming skeptical about spending anything on any kind of PR/marketing at all, if it cannot bring any results: more on this later.\n\n(One note regarding \"grassroots/word-of-mouth\": I cannot go into this too much as it's going to be too long already, but one problem with paying so many people to do marketing/PR/tweet is that it stifles grassroots efforts. People think: if someone is already paid to do it, why should I do it? It creates a 'delegation of work' mindset. In coins that don't have professional PR/marketing, the community feels they need to mobilize. - Nevertheless, many good things happened on crypto twitter re:DCR, but wer mostly started by individuals who are not paid by the Treasury - ie. things that would have happened anyway... these are spontaneous, like the \"buy DCR\" quasi-meme that ignited on Twitter... you cannot force these things. When it comes from users, it's cool; when it comes from a PR or marketing employee, it's \"how do you do, fellow kids?\")\n\n---\n","signature":"b03bfe2f437582e0b994cc8249dedf59e94dbc3b49b8bfa819f1bd3a7fac91e6dd63759a361061d25760eb8e545a00eb12e253c5f8176774ba003737cc73c60c","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"5","receipt":"70fb9e99bc503d253d98277a9ac16e56a1f9e0e8321ac152920ef61017268d39bf01f65be06671466a110d3e49e358fcd0acac4c265633172bedb33f15f2c902","timestamp":1578437643,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

When I was the main moderator of the subreddit, I was told that price discussions must be removed because they are, quote, \"spam\". Later I managed to convince them DCR leadership to allow 1 price thread at a time. If you check other communities, price is discussed often. Like it or not, it's what's on people's minds, what they want to talk about. It's how they measure a project's success (of course more adoption = higher price in coins with limited supplies!) The fact that DCR tried to make price a taboo topic severely stifled community growth. I understand this was partially due to regulatory concerns, still, we were the only ones suppressing price talk. While I understand it can quickly devolve, we still need to address this elephant in the room. The Treasury, and the contractors' salaries, after all, depend on it.\n\nThis is supposed to be a store of value, after all, and not a charity for funding cool projects, art, and interesting ideas. If we constantly lose value vs BTC, it gives potential and current investors less reason to store value in DCR as opposed to BTC. A stakeholder is aware that a lot of value will bleed out via sell pressure coming from contractors, so **we must make sure all the sell pressure we add, does result in a counteracting buy pressure.**\n\nAlthough unfortunately, you chose to mention only USD price. DCR/USD is only a reflection, a shadow, and not the real thing. If BTC went to 100k, DCR would be at $200 or more automatically, without any \"increase in awareness\". \n\nBut consider that many of the stakeholders entered into DCR via BTC (there was no other way until recently) and that most volume actually happens in that pair (DCR/BTC): very little volume outside that pair. So if we look at that, we lost more than 2x (0.0045 -\u003e 0.0021) since you were hired. Again, I'm totally aware that we're in a bear market and that you were not hired to \"pump us\", but is this depressing performance on the market consistent with the claim that awareness is at an all-time high?  OK, enough about price, let's move on\n\n---\n\n\u003eLibra\n\nWe spent resources on placing our comments on Libra in the media. While the comments Jake made were very insightful, it's not the task of a #36 cryptocurrency to comment on some Facebook project that was only interesting to the US/EU regulators and to competing stablecoins. The claim that this somehow benefitted DCR is questionable. I don't see any direct benefit. There could be, very indirectly, like someone thinking: \"hm, this project lead made a really pertinent and insightful comment, so the project he's working on must be interesting and I should check it out\" - it's not impossible, but it's such a long shot and so indirect, that it makes me wonder whether it was money well spent; especially seeing how by now, nobody talks about Libra anymore and it's a completely forgotten topic already.\n\n\u003eThis is the year for Decred!\n\nIt's also the year of the Linux desktop, I can feel it.\n\n\u003eThe foundation has been laid, awareness is high\n\nRepeating \"awareness is high\" doesn't magically make it so! Where's the evidence? \"X amounts of articles/podcasts/videos\" is not proof of awareness increasing, only engagement and positive action is!\n\n\u003e\"**We are confident** the altcoin winter is almost over\"\n\n**Is a PR agency giving us technical analysis of the charts?** And with \"confidence\" even? Well, I don't blame you: lacing your Proposal with some *hopium* is a good marketing move!\nBut what are you basing this claim on? \n\n---\n\nThis is already too long, so to conclude, a **TL;DR version of my opinion**: Ditto has done good, especially when it comes to placing us in some top-level crypto media, but they are not cheap, the price has tanked to almost all-time lows, while some other projects still managed to rise during bear, we didn't. 30% price reduction is nice, and what I really like about your Proposal is that you started to talk about something that was a taboo topic in DCR circles (price): it's something that is on all investors/holders/stakers minds, whether they admit it or not. So articulating this, verbalizing this, is a big plus and shows awareness on your part. Still, I cannot get over the fact that you keep saying how awareness has increased to all-time high yet it's not reflected anywhere (except in feelings and anecdotes). Marketing firms are best at marketing themselves, so I cannot trust your promises or your technical analysis of the markets saying \"alt winter is definitely over\" (lacing Proposal with hopium to increase chances of renewal!), so while I like you guys, I have a hard time believing your promises for the future considering the above. I think from now on, I'll vote only yes for development Proposals. DCR was purely dev focused and no marketing initially, later we pivoted to marketing, even to things like Facebook/Google ads, then a PR agency, then a $300K marketing fund - and we've seen very little to no results in terms of anything measurable, quantifiable, like even a slight increase in metrics (especially in the metric that is hardest to Sybil: price). \n\nNot long ago in a conversation with another stakeholder, referring to us pivoting to marketing, I jokingly remarked that if we are going to \"sell our soul to the devil\", at least we should get something in return for it! In those Faustian stories, the person doing the pact with the devil is always rewarded with riches. But here it's not even that, we sold our soul and got very little in return. Not good enough. So perhaps better to go to our roots and be purely dev-focused again (or at least keep the non-dev expenditures to Education,  like video tutorials, guides, etc.), then we can keep that 'cypherpunk' image which many seem to value still.","signature":"3f0f67cbf7141a61e836ee3475e8122903e7fd2de4e1d3c88cf4b91f5a8a7f5961c3fd4c8485b9a94bb0f4bb69b6648c40663d4b8b75bf3c46fd481427aea501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"6","receipt":"b684995cb2c788978c05e721cfc0ec764d333c7804b459ba2f0c0887f2df3af90fb1b51abd9b30b1305ab4aa463b9e2d1fdce550d6e69f32dc0814d74d5d1101","timestamp":1578437679,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

They are nice people and I have enjoyed working with each of them, but that's not really what's at issue.  If they were all regular contractors being paid regular contractor rates they would have 100% of my support.  However, since we are once again being asked to allocate extraordinary amounts of money to PR the results in my opinion also need to be extraordinary.  So far we have spent USD 300k from the Decred treasury on Ditto and this proposal seeks authorization for another USD 105k.  These are vast sums of money even if we were not constrained in any way.\n\nI'll offer a few broad critiques here and will expand in additional comments (for brevity) if asked to do so.  Before that, I would like to address a few issues in this proposal that put me off and highlight the difficulty of assigning performance metrics to disciplines such as PR or marketing.\n\n1.  The insinuation that the amount of Decred locked in PoS is relevant as a metric for gauging Ditto's success is rather absurd.  That trend was in place long before Ditto was hired.  While things like staking or even hashrate can definitely be influenced by the market's perception, our status has never got to the point where there are unknown new players that seem to be showing up and moving the needle significantly.\n2.  In a similar vein, having our PR firm market to us and make statements like \"Ditto is confident alt winter is close to over\" is equal parts disappointing and scary.  Nobody can forecast this stuff, and trying to blunt the impact of another large spend with a big huff of hopium and the prospect that good times are on the horizon is just straight up manipulative.  Nobody sane expected PR to make \"number go up\", even though I'm sure we'd all be patting ourselves on the back for making great decisions if it would have happened, but price, and more broadly market dynamics should play a roll in how we plan expenditures as that's just prudent.\n3.  There is a decent amount of buzz that has been generated around Decred by various new parties, for example; Chris Burniske, Murad Mahmudov, Checkmate, passages like:\n\"Crypto community and beyond: From Nic Carter to Murad Mahmudov, Decred has sparked the interest of so many people in the crypto community — especially the maxis.  We need to stay in front of these people!\"\nMake it seem as though Ditto has been the driving force behind those wins.  This is misleading in my view, and the notion that so-called \"smart money\" or institutions will have their investment decisions swayed by shrewd PR is in my opinion unrealistic.\n\nThe main value Ditto was supposed to deliver was PR, i.e. greater top tier media exposure.  It's hard to separate the opportunities that would have not come our way had Ditto not been pushing for them versus the stuff that we could have got on our own.  And whilst there has always been a feeling amongst many of us that we are largely ignored, we still did get some top tier media coverage even without professionals backing us.  The big change is that we are now seizing many opportunities that in my view are worthless and only being acted on because we're paying so dearly to have them brought to us.  Credit where credit is due there were some big wins with top tier media, as well as value that was delivered in other areas that I'm often critical of and define as \"scope creep\" e.g. social media work.  While this may have been explicitly authorized by the stakeholders I would implore my peers to consider how this is a slippery slope.  There's no doubt that Ditto is doing a bunch of stuff, however, my rough metric for evaluating the deliverables would be the delta between the quality exposure Ditto brings us versus what we can achieve without them.  Doing random podcasts with minor Twitter celebrities or having pieces published on sites that receive very little traffic is not the stuff we need professionals to capture.\n\nOn a similar tangent, the final topic I'd like to broach is that of community engagement.  I don't have a solution here and this is something that will likely resurface in the future.  My read is that having a class of contractors that are paid an extraordinary amount relative to their peers while delivering results that are decent in some domains and only average in others rightly causes alienation among the community.  If we're asking people to go out and engage, whether it be on Twitter or at real events, and they are doing it as volunteers or as individual contractors while a class of \"managers\" begins to emerge that is likely earning an order of magnitude more than everyone else on an hourly basis, it should be no surprise if people begin to capitulate and develop an expectation that; _Ditto's getting paid ten times more than everyone else, so they should do it._\n\nMy hope is that this doesn't come off as too negative, as I do want to be as constructive as possible.  While I'm obviously not for continuing on the same path we have been traveling I will continue to do my best to support Decred as well as the community and contractors that make it so special, and are the key to our continued growth and success, regardless of the outcome of any specific vote.","signature":"3ed45ccdd109715f55abf9f2aee949a5a4c620fd99b94bd42e003477743971fda1c86ee3b7d7024b6ff0e885f5de0d3e5f32b0d86757124e93aade295442a10e","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"7","receipt":"66bd9d9230586c01a2021228187549ed54b66d6e24739d39d003822ef80feff958332db7695c5566b74e75e98747cd8d7fb0788245fbc2d4b2202a47b1c04e07","timestamp":1578439398,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
