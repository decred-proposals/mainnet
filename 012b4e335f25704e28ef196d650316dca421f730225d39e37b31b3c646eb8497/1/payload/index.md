Ditto Communications Proposal for Decred: Phase 3

**Recap of the Past Year
**

[Ditto](https://www.dittopr.co/) has been a proud partner with Decred for one year. We were the first proposal to be approved on Politeia, which was a “contentious” bid against another PR firm. Six months ago, we were overwhelmingly approved to continue our work. It has been an honor to work with Decred. 

At a high level, awareness and understanding of Decred has never been higher. From social media to events to media relations, Ditto has led communications efforts on behalf of Decred that have established it as one of the most well-respected (and undervalued) projects in crypto. And it makes sense for the most well established PR firm in this space to be working with one of the most reputable projects! 

In 2019, we created a big foundation of broad awareness by definitively answering the question, “What is Decred?” More recently in Phase 2, we fine-tuned and evolved a messaging foundation to communicate Decred’s value proposition, created quality content to educate and bring valuable people into the fold, secured impactful media coverage, empowered the community to engage online, created a repository of educational resources to share with the world, and created a rapid response system so Decred could enter and own important and relevant conversations online.

In the spirit of transparency, below is a thorough summary of our results for Phase 2 (you can see our results for Phase 1 in our [previous proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04)): 

*Phase 1 vs. Phase 2 Coverage Comparison
*

The bulk of our Phase 2 proposal was focused on continuing our media momentum and building upon the solid foundation we laid in Phase 1. 

Our efforts paid off in spades, and we’re excited to report these highlights of Phase 1 vs. Phase 2: 

- Total media placements: Nearly tripled (275%) coverage, from 20 to 55 placements
- Top-tier coverage: Doubled from 10 to 20
- Interviews: Doubled (211%) from 18 to 38 
- Features: 150% increase from 6 to 9

*Interviews*
- Secured 38 interviews and expanded our bench of spokespeople. In Phase 1, Decred’s primary spokespeople were Jake, Marco, and Luke. In Phase 2, we added Akin, JZ, richardred, and Zubair. Akin has been very active lately, particularly with the mainstream media, as his corporate and government finance background and experience in Africa is of high interest to reporters - giving him credibility and opportunity to talk about Decred.
- 14 interviews (37%) were Tier-One, with reporters at outlets like CoinDesk, The Block, Fortune, and Robb Report. 
- We secured 4 interviews for Akin on his NYC media tour, which included Fortune, The Block, Pomp’s Off the Chain podcast, and the Chain Reaction podcast. 
- 7 appearances on the top crypto podcasts (details in the media section below). 

*Media Coverage* 
- In the last six months, we secured 55 articles for Decred, averaging 9 placements per month. 
- 20 Tier-One placements (36% of all placements) and 9 feature stories.
   - Crypto Tier-One: 7 total placements (2 features on the Decred Privacy launch, 5 mentions) in CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, and The Block, covering topics like governance, privacy, and commentary on Libra
   - Crypto Tier-One podcasts: 7 appearances on some of the most listened-to and respected podcasts in the cryptoverse
      - “Unchained” with Laura Shin - one of the most popular crypto podcasts globally. Also amplified via Forbes and the Unchained e-newsletter. JZ spoke with her about Decred and broke the news about the privacy feature. 
      - “Off the Chain” with Anthony Pompliano (2x - Jake and Akin). Pomp’s show just crossed 2 million downloads in December 2019. He’s a top crypto influencer who is now a Decred fan.  
      - “Chain Reaction” with Tom Shaughnessy (2x - Jake and Akin). Tom is the co-founder of Delphi Digital and highly respected in the crypto investment space.    
      - “Base Layer” with David Nage. Ranked 4.9 out of 5 stars on Apple podcasts. Reaches the institutional investor audience. 
      - “Messari Unqualified Opinions” with Ryan Selkis, who has been part of crypto since 2013, working for Consensys and CoinDesk before starting Messari, a highly respected research firm covering the crypto economy.  
- Mainstream: 6 placements across top-tier business and technology outlets like Forbes (3x) with commentary on Libra and the global digital currency race, CNBC with Libra commentary, and Mashable with Libra commentary. 

*Published content*
- 4 published bylines/op-eds in crypto trades
   - Two in CoinDesk: [Staking Isn’t Just a Way to Earn Money and it Shouldn’t Be](https://www.coindesk.com/staking-isnt-just-a-way-to-earn-crypto-money-and-it-shouldnt-be) and [It’s Time to Walk the Talk on Decentralized Governance](https://www.coindesk.com/its-time-to-walk-the-talk-on-decentralized-governance)
   - CCN: [Libra: Friend or Foe?](https://www.ccn.com/libra-friend-or-foe/)
   - Cointelegraph: [Secrets they missed at DevCon: What it’s really like working in a DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/news/secrets-they-missed-at-devcon-what-its-really-like-in-a-working-dao)

*Speaking & Events*
- Ditto worked with Decred to organize a range of events, from local Meetups to the bigger, more mainstream technology stages like Web Summit and CES. We:
   - Secured a high-profile speaking opportunity for Akin on the Digital Money Forum at CES “The Libra Effect” panel (January 7, 2020). This puts Decred in the company of moderator Michael Casey, who is the Chief Content Officer for CoinDesk, and the Head of Policy for Libra. 
   - Offered remote media support for Web Summit and Marco’s panel by creating comprehensive briefing materials. 
   - Coordinated Jake’s presentation on the crypto privacy landscape and Decred’s implementation to the SF Bitcoin Meetup (a first-ever for Decred), and Decred SF Devs Meetup at Coinbase. 

*Social Media*

A new goal and mandate for Ditto in Phase 2 was to grow Decred’s presence and engagement on social media, especially on Crypto Twitter, where the industry influencers have their conversations, and where newbies go to find out what’s happening. We developed a comprehensive social media playbook and reviewed it with a core group of community members who wanted to help with our efforts. 

We recruited and activated 35 community members to actively participate in organic Twitter engagement. Ditto researched and compiled a list of Thought Leader and Influencer Accounts by category with the community, allowing them greater opportunity to engage on Decred’s behalf. 

We launched a grassroots social media campaign in August 2019. Since that time, here are some major milestones: 

- Twitter engagement: From July to August, we helped to double impressions of the Decred project handle to over 5.6 million and engagement often includes resources and calls to action for new potential supporters. From [Decred Digest](https://medium.com/decred/decred-journal-august-2019-43626ee68ff): “Outreach has made a concerted effort to increase engagement on Twitter via quality content and education regarding Decred. This was demonstrated by project impression counts more than doubling from July to over 5.6M.”
- Helped coordinate broad social media campaigns on governance, privacy, and Decred in general as well as a campaign specific to crypto developers. For example: 
   - #Cryptodevs: A campaign to focus on building awareness of the unique challenges and abilities that come with being a blockchain developer as a way to get the blockchain developer and greater crypto community more exposure to Decred’s successful and sustainable model resulting in 44 tweets, reaching ~56K accounts by 27 participants. 
   - #decreddancechallenge: A campaign born out of one spontaneous dance became a hashtag and rally for Decred overnight, thanks to Team Ditto picking up the torch and branding the dance with #decreddancechallenge, resulting in 36 tweets by 20 participants from all over the world.

We hope that these results illustrate our commitment and understanding of Decred, as well as how to communicate its core values across a variety of audiences and channels. 

This humbly brings us to our third proposal for Decred.   

**What**

Ditto is proposing a communications campaign that builds upon the momentum and success of the past year. At a high level, we want to continue to drive broad awareness of Decred and its unique value proposition. This will be done through a strategic month-over-month approach to communications that includes cementing the project’s ownership of topics like governance and privacy, as well as through hard news announcements like Lightning Network and other proposals that have been approved through Politeia. 

We want to take the awareness we’ve built and trade it up for higher-impact opportunities that consolidate Decred’s position as a top project. In the next phase, we need to answer the question, “Why Decred?” Moving forward — and especially in the current market — we need to strategically position Decred so that your audiences understand and appreciate its long-term value relative to other cryptocurrencies. The quality of communications will be particularly important in this next phase. And at the same time, we’ll need to maintain a steady stream of coverage in the background to keep the crypto community involved and excited about Decred. 

Our Phase 3 proposal entails: 
- Evolving Decred’s positioning, messaging, and talking points
- Continuing month-over-month, high-quality media coverage, which also includes op-ed drafting and placement
- Amplifying awareness through smart, strategic community activation

In this next phase, we believe Decred should be focusing on the following target audiences:
- Tier-one reporters: From big podcasts to big crypto outlets to mainstream publications, Ditto will continue to utilize our relationships in the media and Decred’s work and vision to generate broad awareness and differentiate Decred from other projects.  
- Crypto community: There are two types of crypto community members: 1) those who already hold DCR in their bag and 2) those who remain on the sidelines. Decred needs to consistently remind the former why they should continue to hodl, and convince the latter that DCR should be in their portfolio.
- Smart money: As smart money — be it Family Offices, VCs, Funds or HNW investors — steadily comes off the side or looks to increase their position in digital assets, Decred needs to be top-of-mind.  

We are happy to answer any questions in response to the community’s feedback.

**Why**

2019 was a groundbreaking year for crypto. Facebook’s Libra turned crypto into the water cooler topic overnight and blew the lid off mainstream media conversations around crypto: what it is, how it’s governed, and who the important players are (could you imagine Decred being quoted in Mashable before June 2019?!). In Washington D.C., there were hearings on crypto and Donald Trump Tweeted about it! Can you imagine that 2-3 years ago? China announced their interest in utilizing blockchain — as did several other nation-states. While privacy has always been a topic of conversation in the community, it really caught fire in the second half of the year, both inside and outside crypto. And while some projects shut down, the crypto pie continued to grow, with corporations and institutional players like Fidelity entering from the sidelines. 

The crypto conversation significantly matured in 2019, and Decred was an important part of discussions around decentralized governance, store of value, staking, and privacy. Many reporters knew instinctively to include Decred in such stories, but the truth is that reporters in outlets like CoinDesk were attracted to projects that are bigger, have been around longer (many backed by big VCs) and have a semi-famous founder or lead developer (Zooko, Justin, CZ, etc.). As a result, even the most mundane actions coming out of projects like ZCash, Dash, EOS, and Cosmos got media attention. 

Pricewise, the entire crypto market took a hit — Decred included. DCR did experience a few unique wins, though: As Checkmate pointed out, DCR demonstrated a Power Law relationship with Bitcoin this year. It also saw a major spike in November after major upgrades to Politeia, while other projects like Dash and Zcash steadily declined throughout that same time period. While no one can say for sure what’s behind price changes, continued education and awareness have a role to play in ensuring Decred’s audiences understand its value and want to participate in the project.

In 2020, the competition will only heat up. The crypto space will continue to consolidate around an ever-shrinking pool of big names, and Decred will need to be smart and aggressive about keeping its (rightfully deserved) seat at that table. As the project continues to build and develop, smart communications will have an important role to play in flipping Decred’s status from an undervalued project to a valued and valuable project. 

The good news is that awareness of Decred has never been higher. More people know and (somewhat) understand the project. We can’t stop now! We believe Decred needs to maintain high awareness to prepare for the next wave of adoption and capture market share from anyone looking to enter the fold, from day traders to institutional investors, to everyone in between. Though it’s an open secret that many maximalists hold DCR in their bags as a hedge, we’ll need to keep the pedal down in 2020 to not only defend, but grow, Decred’s voice in the conversations (and the bags!) that matter. We need to keep the puck moving forward to ensure that Decred remains ahead of the curve, no matter what type of market we’re in. 

So, why Ditto? We’ve been a partner to Decred for a whole year. We’re completely integrated into the Decred community. We have a deep understanding of Decred and a daily (if not hourly!) rapport with dozens of community members. With our fingers on the pulse of the media landscape, we’re uniquely positioned between journalists and the community to keep Decred in front of the media day after day. We have proven that we can give strategic guidance, move fast, and listen to the community. We’re transparent, and as our bi-weekly updates show, we’re able to regularly deliver impactful results. 

And we love working with Decred!

**How**

*1. Evolve Decred’s positioning, messaging, and talking points* 

Messaging is where we got our start with Decred, and it has a no less important role to play as we head into Phase 3. Because what we are talking about and how we talk about it has to change, evolve and improve.

In coordination with the community, we created and significantly built out Decred’s foundational messaging platform throughout 2019. This document has served as the cornerstone of almost everything we’ve done, from rallying the community to engage on Twitter, to building the educational resources repository, to providing Decred spokespeople with talking points for interviews, to educating journalists on how Decred works. 

Ditto’s first action item if we are approved will be to re-evaluate how to talk about Decred depending on the audience and how to talk about topics like privacy and Lightning Network that relate back to the project. Something we have been thinking a lot about is using phrases like “digital money,” “mobile money,” and “digital currency.” We also want to cement how we talk about staking from an educational and practical use case perspective. 

It’s this type of message refining that will continue to best explain Decred and allow the community and spokespersons to own topics in crypto like staking in a way that everyone associates it with Decred. 

Ditto will work with the community to maintain, refine, and update the document on an ongoing, as-needed basis. We will solicit community input, develop drafts for review, present it to the community via GitHub, and collaborate to finalize and approve. 

*2. Continue month-over-month, high-quality media coverage, including op-ed drafting and placement*

From Laura Shin to WSJ to Cointelegraph to Forbes to Pomp, Ditto has produced both quality and quantity. At this stage, we can confidently say that every reporter in the crypto space knows who Decred is. Now that we have broad awareness in place, we see a need to achieve three simultaneous goals: 

- Expand Decred’s piece of the crypto pie by cementing its reputation in the broader crypto community 
   
- Expand the pie beyond crypto to include the smart money standing on the sidelines
  
- Solidify Decred’s association with relevant topics (privacy, staking, governance, etc.)

To achieve these goals, at the next stage we will focus on three broad buckets:

- a) High-impact, tier one stories

We will hand pick the highest-quality, most impactful media opportunities in tier-one crypto media (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, The Block, etc.) to ensure that Decred is securing feature coverage around releases and moments of importance to the project. We will also pursue tier-one non-crypto media outlets (Bloomberg, CNBC, Cheddar, Nasdaq, etc.) that are read by the smart money still standing on the sidelines of crypto waiting to get in on the right project. We’ll set a goal of securing at least one more big mainstream feature, similar to The Wall Street Journal story we secured in 2019. While these types of stories occur less often, they will generate the quality reliable sources Decred needs to consolidate its reputation long-term.

Some of Decred’s best conversations and content have been podcast recordings and in-person interviews at events and conferences. Therefore, as part of our high-impact outreach, we will both maintain Decred’s presence on the podcast circuit, and, similar to what we did at Web Summit, the World Crypto & Blockchain Conference, etc., continue to schedule on-site interviews for Decred spokespeople at events to maximize Decred’s time on the ground. 

- b) Steady drumbeat of awareness 

While our focus will be on high-tier, high-impact media coverage, it’s especially important in a bear market not to lose sight of the role that consistent crypto trade coverage plays in keeping Decred top of mind and in a positive light. Non-tier-one trades still have a broad crypto readership, many of whom are DCR holders. It’s important we keep them abreast of the good work Decred is doing, and Decred must maintain its foothold on the awareness it has earned over the past year. This will require that we consistently stay in front of crypto journalists to ensure that Decred is taking part in conversations around staking, governance, store of value, treasury spending, DAOs, etc. 

- c) Op-eds and placement

Ditto worked with the community on a variety of content last year, from co-creating and publishing thought leadership op-eds in CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, and CCN to crowdsourcing and placing points of view on breaking news of the day (Facebook Libra, China’s state-owned cryptocurrency, etc.) in mainstream media outlets like CNBC and Mashable. 

At the next stage, Ditto will continue to identify opportunities for Decred to produce content on a monthly basis. With the community’s help, we will create topic-relevant op-eds on staking, privacy, and other topics relevant to Decred. In some cases, Ditto’s in-house content creation team will draft the articles or points of view in coordination with the community; in others, community members can lead the way and Ditto can review/edit. Ideally, the output would be 1 piece of content per month.

*3. Amplify awareness through smart, strategic community activation*

In the past six months, Ditto has had the opportunity to work closely with Decred’s highly engaged and vibrant community. We successfully equipped community members to build Decred’s online awareness in an educational and impactful way. And while these efforts were previously ad hoc and distributed, now, numerous individuals who stood on the sidelines are acting as powerful, smart, educational voices on Crypto Twitter — and as a result, engagement is higher than it’s ever been. 

We’ve also worked closely with the community to build a master repository of educational content intended to educate Decred’s target audiences. That repository — which at the time of this writing is being prepared for publication on Decred’s website — makes it easy for journalists, crypto enthusiasts, investors, and anyone interested in Decred to find that information. 

The next step is to merge the community engagement and educational resources repository pieces together into a single combined campaign aimed at amplifying and educating. With our solid foundation of educational materials, we will build proactive campaigns around each topic (similar to the #cryptodevs campaign) to create an echo effect across media outlets and social media. We will activate the community to participate on social media by sharing key messages from the messaging document, as well as sharing links to the best Decred content around the web, pulled from the educational resources repository. 

Finally, the educational resources repository is not a static document — it’s a living body of work that needs to grow and change along with the project. Since we already have our finger on the pulse of the media, Crypto Twitter, and third-party content websites, Ditto will keep the repository up to date with the latest, best-quality content from around the Internet, be it a new blog post by checkmate, an op-ed by Jake in CoinDesk, or a Lightning Network blog post by matheus. And we’ll continually seek out opportunities to spread the Decred message outside the community and pull a growing number of players into the fold. 

**Who**

Since Trey Ditto, Liz Bagot, Margaret Huang, Leslie Ankney, and Anastasia Golovina have worked so closely with the Decred community over the past year, we propose keeping the team as-is in 2020. Our biographies are below.

**When**

Decred had a fantastic year on the development side: Progress on Lightning Network, mobile wallets launching, privacy implementation, and the DEX, to name just a few. But the bear market presents challenges to every crypto project, with most being forced to tighten their belts to weather the storm. In recognition of these challenges, and as our work evolves to become more targeted and strategic, Ditto is reducing its monthly retainer — thought this won’t sacrifice our level of engagement with the community. As we’ve done for the past year, this will be a 6-month contract with a simple 30-day out clause. Ditto proposes a monthly budget of $20,000 equivalent in DCR for the above services to be rendered.
