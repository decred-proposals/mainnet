Without such spaces where outsiders can follow and understand decision-making, there is a significant barrier between those on the inside making the decisions, and those on the outside. In that case the best that insiders can hope to do is to accurately interpret the needs of the other stakeholders and act in a way they think is fair.\n\nIn my view building a successful cryptocurrency movement requires acquainting many more people with the fundamentals the technology. Only on this basis can people act as effective guardians of the networks. The best way to achieve this is with a role people can productively play, and incentives!\n\nDecred's approach is excellent in this regard:\n\n- Granting stakeholders a quantifiable say in decision-making that cuts across every aspect of the project through both the on-chain consensus voting and Politeia proposals\n- Incentivising participation with voting rewards, for ticket voters.\n- Incentivising participation with treasury funds, for contributors who work on the project and generate value for the project and space\n\nAny project that wants to be resistant to social attacks should be pursuing the same kinds of aims. I think it would be very worthwhile to track where all of this activity is happening in the space and start developing a better collective view on what is going on.\n\nFor projects where it is not possible to identify such open public spaces, and where \"the team\" are effectively walled off from the community by handlers - that would probably signify more of a centralized/hierarchical/corporate production model. \n\nI have been thinking about how to build a resource like this, and I hope to put together a prototype for what that could look like in the not too distant future. I think the whole space could benefit from a clear overview of the attributes of each project, the tradeoffs being made, and links to key venues or sources.\n\nI see the social media analysis suggested here as a starting point, the data is quite easily accessible and standardized between projects, so makes for an easy entry-point to understanding some aspects of the  communities and how they organize (or don't).","signature":"0d707cf6a8f805f4b0ee6b7f1e28eba325de7d8b96a6af6fc23f0741b766e300b63bd81acfd0a8861afaf1a6aa855a4dcae65bc7e3f311652b0d530cdbe3be08","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"ab6aee356bc9d9579348bc914e2a727df0dc76db0816b12f531f7a01621f06d027625f803e2948cc0ac7df442f87d81a4969b6e902f806f03af972893bab9106","timestamp":1543272531,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let's assume this research project is completed, and we know how to improve Decred's social media presence. \nIf the new approach is consistent with Ditto's approach, the research would not provide much value. If it is not consistent with Ditto's approach, why do we hire Ditto if we know there are better ways to market Decred.\n\nThere are two research topics I have been thinking for a while, and I don't have an answer. I hope there are other people interested in similar topics.\n\n1) DCR's current market cap is $180 million. How do we arrive at this valuation? Is it because of DCR's governance model? Is it because half of the circulation is locked by POS?\n2) What are the use cases for Decred? Why do we need Decred and how Decred can be used in 3 years. I know this is up to the stakeholders, but it would be great if research can be done to show us the options.","signature":"41f12b3df4fd40d264870c542f1adeebbd14a657bff5c02aea8d0b74cf6309701daafab6b422abd2369d3fc651d392a41014e702019f958ce128886dd5df5d0f","publickey":"2ab21c9a6a138ff055181eccd82999b83a034299eaa21f8fd55d9e5232a4f3d3","commentid":"8","receipt":"2d8714c605c5925f08a0b8b10e32faa53e0e40834f6ecf210929db68a3af927f86a9ff0b62e6b1cf59831b6ba90f829cc6b07020095204a09b8ef41245b0db04","timestamp":1543369358,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Examples include [Jake at MIT](https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/jake-yocom-piatt-decred-blockchain-sovereignty/) giving a straight forward presentation, the fascinating ideas during the [Politeia Challenge](https://medium.com/@slgoss04/decreds-politeia-challenge-took-place-february-10th-at-the-hyatt-regency-in-austin-texas-482986b75a18) and even the classic [Politeia Use Cases EP4 of Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQYmLx0eTg) which aired over a year ago now.\n\nWe are using Politeia and dcrtime and it works great.  The success should be viewed like the Mars landing.  This is a very big deal and frankly other projects are missing out by not utilizing these tools and the practically free blockchain anchoring and pre-built authorization abilities in Politeia.\n\nA lot of other things are also going right.  A quick search of what good [readme files](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) should look like on open source projects or a deep dive into the code in the [politeia code](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui) illustrates we have solid repositories and excellent code commenting.\n\nIs the extended community interested in looking at how to better support the development team that has built these tools in advocating for their usage?  If so, are we interested in researching some basic questions?  Here are a few examples that could be looked at:\n\n1. What are projects today doing as best practice to attract usage?\n2. What do business integration companies working with other products today want that has not been built out (specifications? documentation? technical briefs? media/materials?)?\n3. Approximately how much effort would be required to build any of the examples shared in presentations (certification authorization, poa, etc...) and what are requirements (skills, assets, services)?","signature":"44a1bc733242fe0e897a82cc473720834f64aa3176125c3a34d963fb545d09dcf2d022a5774412979e63b9711639ad18b913fe4f9697aebf1da2b47d1a4ff500","publickey":"6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","commentid":"9","receipt":"ba2110b57a17750854f75247d7fc627ce82099f290bc561afeb1d91622828fa744c5e869a0764f88ca4a6033a4c692feeb50532576d13b3dafee1fbc4a66b807","timestamp":1543390301,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Research that helps us to understand this would be worthwhile.\n\nThe example questions are interesting, but without proposed methodologies it is difficult to evaluate whether they are the best questions to ask.\n\nFor this subject, I think I would want to hear from _potential users_ of dcrtime/politeia about whether they are interested in the features that this software offers. \n\nWho are these _potential users_? Well, I think that's something we should consider first in some depth. Who do we think could benefit from dcrtime? What kind of uses would we like to promote?\n\nIf we know who the potential users are, we could come up with a methodology that involves reaching out to those groups in some way, making them aware of dcrtime and what it can do - and _then_ asking our questions about whether they're interested and what the likely impediments would be. \n\nWith this kind of approach the work could serve outreach and research purposes at the same time.","signature":"b14884851e61bf3c1d096b4e3b368b4b6b7d13e37c8f566b4544f0a000aba1a3d33ae0e9a55eaa1b284a6df299b137b4a1ce4bf52a672313ad64be03c2a45800","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"12","receipt":"fe64bbc89cdbc3d87c53a179b64b015407ecffffeee5f616bc045f34ababd6638c2a73000662a18877a6d8987eb362b47b285a034ef96e957f4ca9e08d233608","timestamp":1543508974,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don't think it is possible to assess how well a project is governed without observing that governance in action. If you can't point to the locations where a project's governance takes place, participation is probably not open and permissionless.","signature":"fbdd3590a311af9a68133f0f38a2ad2fabdbec144c63b60bda286dd8402542aa8f76d43b2c16b26d64c493f05b0f5618dbace19e8b0e2ae18b9be725a5a6e808","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"16","receipt":"6a76100017cbfdd2b596ef8d520c29ff6a56efc5d2dbe503c7fe5b19361b380a166201ad0bf51d17d749007ba20aff03eeec2fa0fe15b39fcc7eaaf9b9de240d","timestamp":1543535164,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That's a good focus but I think it would make sense to also incorporate gathering information about some other aspects of the various blockchains/cryptocurrencies.

For instance, when it comes to \"Decred solves the problem of value dilution via contentuous hard forks\" - a counter I always read is: \"what is wrong with forking and then letting the market decide? Basically I'm suggesting researching the strongest skeptical or critical points that are common, so that we can then address them in the most effective way. Similar to what we did in the now defunct #FUDresearch , but not directed at specific FUD, instead rather at more general skepticism about Decred's value proposition.

Research possibility of repeating the airdrop, perhaps in perpetuity, and what Sybil-resistant methods would be available that do not require KYC. - Possibly implementation via NFC chips on passports (zero-knowledge) as described by Mike Hearn in 2014: https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2014/000574.html - even if the airdropped amount was minuscule, it would boost Decred's reach and network effects. This would greatly expand Decred's initial airdrop idea. The main question is the economics of it. My bet is that the gained network effect would cancel / outweight the negative effects of people dumping the airdropped coins. Perhaps study this in conjunction with the question why even free market, libertarian economist F.A. Hayek supported a kind of \"basic income\". What was his argument, why wasn't he worried about currency losing value if there was such an universal airdrop?","signature":"7852b9df013a5478eea85a4dda43bb8cc425abc97115025bad9cefef96bc218fd5165df1629b65086aec49ca91b68c0822bbe058ff35399c9ddfa0a423306a02","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"30","receipt":"767ed9395e96ef782c1eeea28d4892ed19f67a98e2f8895b51a0a05637748d6e457963eda6d3c551157a8b4bd2d3b2a310a56231aab98992d189e4d204753601","timestamp":1544143444,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Deleterious to network effects of nascent currencies wrt Metcalfe or (much better IMO) transactome-informed network capital theory (see Gogerty's work) \n2. A/B testing of different technical, economic or philosophical approaches (\"let the market decide\")\n3. An inevitability of entropy and/or finite social scalability as these networks grow and mature it is difficult to keep all stakeholders sufficiently aligned for optimal network health.\n\nAs such, protocol-layer fork resistance and effective public fora with voting mechanisms can certainly be helpful tools, but I suppose there is a question as to whether the so-called tyranny of the majority should be exercised in all cases. If there was a \"block size\" style civil war in Decred with no acceptable compromise in sight, is the status quo still the best situation in all cases?\n\nDisclaimer: I have an ongoing research project studying forks from a variety of perspectives and Decred's fork-resistance got a nod in the manuscript. Going to revisit it again soon.
