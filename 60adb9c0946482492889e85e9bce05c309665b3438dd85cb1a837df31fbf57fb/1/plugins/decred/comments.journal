Also, what prevents IDAX from delisting Decred later for \"lack of volume\" or similar reasons? Are you requesting this amount be paid up front, or after completion?","signature":"eaf879d1d1fa899c0344dd217c84c384eda5466ad17e48719161a20b41f3f8a80e81587a8aa462952739fc7a085c6739e07c23ddffac6766016db1cba305de04","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"1","receipt":"ad9a1d2e1111f661d0494dfbb4db0a5d3b891ad66ac313958c96b15c203e1e17115507dc0919d0d0359c1cfa0c207b10e6575f663a0ffca70b626170fddaed08","timestamp":1551189389,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
