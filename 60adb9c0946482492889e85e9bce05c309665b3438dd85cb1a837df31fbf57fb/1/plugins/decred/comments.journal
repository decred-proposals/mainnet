Also, what prevents IDAX from delisting Decred later for \"lack of volume\" or similar reasons? Are you requesting this amount be paid up front, or after completion?","signature":"eaf879d1d1fa899c0344dd217c84c384eda5466ad17e48719161a20b41f3f8a80e81587a8aa462952739fc7a085c6739e07c23ddffac6766016db1cba305de04","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"1","receipt":"ad9a1d2e1111f661d0494dfbb4db0a5d3b891ad66ac313958c96b15c203e1e17115507dc0919d0d0359c1cfa0c207b10e6575f663a0ffca70b626170fddaed08","timestamp":1551189389,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Any team should be able to do the integration within ~50 hours.\n\n\nAnd I fell odd about the even 1000 DCR number, how did you arrive at this ? \n\nAlso having never paid a listing fee (Even for binance) why do you feel we should pay for this ?","signature":"fa3fde57783d24316965d8de098fa4bc1d2496167785244e6f23f2f0d0b7e84b915e1751ea9941ffc0f7346686fdd3348211fba671488555122052cf72d84d0c","publickey":"d18e6dc2871b96d4e0966f3a5d95acc3c1024b7557b15d24597080e4daa68a66","commentid":"2","receipt":"542ac0dccdf28eafef2b4abb5c14fa95caa6e87c1de849c2c3af6076f6fac3c28e4f9fd57279dcabf9fbc4a877c8983ce4a98dd63dcd939d53d7564653564a0a","timestamp":1551206654,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
