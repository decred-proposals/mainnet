So that might need to be defined in the proposal. Perhaps there is some metric that can be used to define big enough? Or, perhaps it's not a binary, but a multiplier?

Part of the problem here I think, is that in addition to general resistance to paying for content, as expressed in other comments, Decred has never been, as far as I've seen, particularly focused on engagement metrics. So there's no precedent/formula to reference. Also, content like this is typically produced by existing community members or contractors that are paid in arrears (after the article is delivered). In that arrangement, the project isn't taking on risk that the article is hidden in Forbes somewhere, or that the author will just write one article and leave the project. If you were already a contractor, it is likely you could write this article and bill the Treasury for it, perhaps against the recently approved [marketing budget](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e).","signature":"84d6cabbec983f829b3783f75616963b54293e19ca1e76687b4edd4cf96ddf1cf85934b505d26dd9f9bd04839310884f7ae68fd85dd73c1ae3cf8bff909fb608","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"12","receipt":"7c45dcc3a9092d9d8db311236f37b53818f3e68082cf0b3648a5bac12a1448e8286b0917e501104a1f9a02ac33d36b8abc3bf3ebe539a5ec41911bb863e5330d","timestamp":1557636661,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Mea culpa and why I will revoke....I thought that Politeia as an experiment was a story worth telling, which was the motivation for the proposal. \n\nGetting earlier feedback may have spared you some time if you do revoke. However, I will point out that there are people in the project that advocate for having more of this type of conversation here on Politeia, where data isn't hosted on a 3rd party and is cryptographically verifiable. So in a way the content you're writing here is kind of a free meta article about submitting a (possibly) rejected proposal, which they will appreciate; as do I, I think this is actually an interesting idea to explore and am curious to see how it plays out. A larger concern is wasting stakeholders' time when they go to review proposals that are put to vote.\n\n\u003e After all, if the article sucked or it was put in a hidden part of Forbes or HuffPo, Politeia would be out 100 DCR...meanwhile, I would be out of any future opportunities.

Thanks for the offer/consideration re: contractor.  \n\nI am of the opinion that the Contributor Experience is going to be an important part of the marketing function of any DAO.

But the DCR payment is not just for me to learn how it is supposed to work, it is of measurable ROI to DCR b/c \n\n1) I will help others understand, through the story of Politeia that I proposed to write, how it is supposed to work so that high quality proposals show up\n\n2) I can highlight/make suggestions of Contributor Experience elements that, perhaps the community will consider should be executed.","signature":"494ffe5ccafb7c7c6fe2fe42ed06eff42b051b5bdf9b8ae1a180a6feb2883d1551d92a36879d189026755577115ff0541f1c8bac982ceb4c5ed2357673ba5908","publickey":"947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7","commentid":"14","receipt":"c9bdea6ac269946a8e3fcaeeb3456df35c82ad39ac6cc8b6f17da639d09995c488e5f3ab32631f094200df39308302c9e017b7b95b9aac1b8460f9c03c153302","timestamp":1557682662,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

For me, it's not a waste since the whole \"industry,\" if you will is a new one and I'm learning all along ;-)\n\nGiven the relatively scarcity of proposals, at the moment, it seems like a waste of stakeholders' time may not be the primary challenge right now, however, it is totally legitimate for down the road.\n\nI guess DCR will benefit no matter what. You are right. Since I am going to write about the experience of submitting a proposal to Politeia and either getting it accepted or rejected.  So, it seems like everyone should just vote against it b/c they will get it for free, right? ;-)\n\nI appreciate your nod to my sincerity and genuine interest in helping the cause. I suppose that is the reason why I would hope the community would vote in favor of it, because it values ppl who do want to genuinely contribute value, took the time to follow the proposal template, etc.  \n\nIt makes me think that maybe there's another avenue for would-be contributors...as in \"deliver value first, then get compensated.\"\n\nSo, for example, let's say my proposal does get rejected. I blog/write an article about it anyway and it generates some traffic, interest, whatever (it would be cool to have a referral link in Decredition that could track downloads stemming from my post).  \n\nThen, I could point to those number and either get tipped or some \"pay per download\" DCR after the fact.\n\nOf course, there's a risk there b/c if I write an article that generates a ton of traffic (for example) and ask for some comp afterwards, the community could always decide to not pay anything.  At the same time, that would certainly dampen my enthusiasm for future work, so there's some cool game theoretics there, right?\n\nAnyway, as you can see, I think about the broad concept of DMO/crypto-CRM (as I like to call it) a lot ;-)\n\nI'm probably going to submit to a vote anyway, because I am curious how this process plays out. I mean, I already paid my .1 DCR (sunk cost fallacy?).\n\nNo matter what happens, I'm cool with it, because of what I've learned about Politeia, DCR, the community, and crypto-CRM/DMO.\n\nSorry, that was a lot of a brain dump.

This is vetting consistent with the DCC process.\n\nHe has a proven track record indicating his ability to deliver results on this proposal. The cost associated is quite modest, but more importantly, the story he's proposing to tell is of great value for Decred to communicate. Politeia is uniquely Decred, and it's the mechanism by which we as a community determine what gets funded and what doesn't. The output and the process are both important, and Jeremy's telling of the story of the process could not only get Decred more awareness and reach in a tier 1 publication, it could provide a solid impetus for additional individuals and businesses to join our community.\n\nFurthermore, Decred is short on marketing talent and execution. We're in need of exactly what Jeremy proposes - people to see where they can contribute and jump in! We're a community of doers and Jeremy has already written multiple articles about Decred and now he's proposing this endeavor more formally. \n\nI think it's consistent with our ideals to vet and qualify as we've done to this point.

This proposal makes it hard to understand if you are merely doing an experiment of using politeia  or if you are genuinely interested in contributing to the project latter on.\n\nMost actual contractors have actually taken the opposite approach : (getting involved with the community first, discussing and contributing and then taking it a step further to become a contractor.) Almost a social equivalent of doing a \"proof of work\".\n\nThe cost of this proposal is \"relatively\" low, you have an interesting background and experiences and I may just take a chance and vote yes... still hesitating...,\n\nRegardless of the outcome, if you are interested in the project I would encourage you to get involved  with the community and make yourself known","signature":"5b8ad8cd7e891505c8d5db5fef9409af8d40a0ddb382ea3fb73aecaed6530d030e363da822c4033c4a45ad27480c6f1d58a4d32160a435a7012a3c5f83d1ff02","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"20","receipt":"7a16db8dacf1d6aefeefd02b7517d42a94ba792f7ce3b163eb653994854af482e29439f74333aa05e978fddb6d093b1bc40332b42992758a57d8b1bd59d1c406","timestamp":1558547303,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Based on the potential up and down sides, I am of the belief that it is worthwhile to launch this spaghetti and see if it sticks.\n\nThere is a notable problem with the proposal, however, which is that it asks for payout in DCR, rather than USD.  I admit that I should have pressed jer979 before putting the proposal up for a vote to change this, and that is my error.  The reason we have contractors bill in USD and get paid out in DCR is that it incentivizes the right behavior: deliver work and get paid at an average monthly exchange rate versus contractors sitting on work until the exchange rate goes up.  Would you be willing to agree to bill in USD, say USD 3,000 for the entire work, with the same 40/60 split on story completion and then publication?","signature":"00261c55c7a65718d809c9d01e5b34022172693893573e88e9834c2f13096ede3698e0d95fc4bec7d07ca4254955bc9fa0ce68e36f7d813941eb62256284e705","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"23","receipt":"72600bb24a86eaed88c83a7f741ddb372fe205a4bd9f9376eca0ca604df7df008abaa72ed980ff5c3baaa8e4e0fec6e40cdf37a99ba5c3f748c0365527925b04","timestamp":1558615782,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Shouldn't they be allowed to propose to be paid a DCR lump sum, and if they really deliver a big win for the community, then they can participate in a fully-aligned way in the value they've just created?  \n\n  -- What if in the future a contractor wants to live as a true Decred citizen, earning Decred, running a business within the Decred economy, and spending Decred.

Shouldn't they be allowed to propose to be paid a DCR lump sum, and if they really deliver a big win for the community, then they can participate in a fully-aligned way in the value they've just created?\n\nFor one, no proposal will double the value of the Decred economy. Barring some miracle (Decred Jesus, are you listening?). You seem to be eluding to paying in arrears (i.e. getting paid only for what you've already done)? That is the way the contractor system works now, but hourly. You're suggesting a performance element. Introducing performance pay is interesting, but presents risk. Especially for marketing tasks. How do you measure the impact of any one action to the \"Decred economy\"? In the modern surveillance capitalism model, you can actually measure this for things like e-commerce. But Decred is so privacy-centric it doesn't even track people on their website.\n\n\u003e -- What if in the future a contractor wants to live as a true Decred citizen, earning Decred, running a business within the Decred economy, and spending Decred. I know it's still a ways around the corner, but wouldn't we generally want to encourage citizens of this new \"digital sovereign\" to index earning, hiring, saving, and spending in DCR terms?\n\nWhile we're still a long way from this for Bitcoin even, the number of merchants does steadily grow. A true die hard could probably survive spending only DCR. This is unrealistic for most contributors for some time though. But something to be encouraged generally.\n\nAs for your suggestions for different forms of payment, I agree there is room for experimentation. The current model (USD-indexed rate) has strong support among \"leadership\" and much of the community, because exposing contractors to the volatility of DCR increases their skin-in-the-game, or some such Talebism. I does appear to have the intended effect much of the time, but also ignores the economic realities of many potential contributors, and keeps some good people out.","signature":"aa4f9bce530912e76695e78fde5d9240f991c1456fb3ec8ccd3be7d1d62851e3c32d9e54093d7cd3011fc3368f8add7552250db743b089c893fa7ad0cfd0bd01","publickey":"1690025d33db0ec5cfdb37e7054ed93c1b4327dd394ee7b593034645bd0c59b3","commentid":"32","receipt":"a9aef12d2c8235bf37a6d21fe85a40c8525d64830c7b0fc320846f7599bb5f6e363da968a968b3bc66c8d02fdca9c85cc31eff73a16cf9a5d00bf7be2e12f105","timestamp":1558773326,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As an example, when Trusted IoT Alliance announced it would partner with the Quantum blockchain project, the value of the Qtum token economy nearly doubled overnight.  \n\nLots of times when a small cap company announces an initial major BD deal, the price of the stock will double.  I know DCR is not a stock, but the principle can still apply.\n\nHow might this happen for Decred?  What about a proposal from a big systems integration company to integrate a voting app for a particular country's upcoming national election with dcrtime, to time-stamp all of the voting events to Decred's blockchain?\n\n\u003e You're suggesting a performance element. \n\nIn the example above, if the proposal from the systems integration company was to be paid 15,000 DCR lump sum, and the price of the token did double as a result of a successful implementation, it would certainly be a nice reward for the systems integration company to participate in the doubling of the value in USD terms of their 15,000 DCR .  Thus, by being paid in DCR, they are fully aligned with the value they are creating for the economy.

Something I have seen while overseeing contractor billing is that things like exchange rates and how those rates are calculated can figure heavily into contractors' behavior.\n\nBilling in DCR creates incentives that do not align well with delivering work in a timely fashion.  If a contractor thinks the exchange rate will go up in the near future and their invoices are denominated in DCR, they are incentivized to sit on their work and not complete it right away.  On the other hand, if the exchange rate is in a downtrend, they are incentivized to hurry and deliver their work product sooner, possibly sacrificing quality in the interest of getting paid out sooner.\n\nSimilarly, how exchange rates are calculated matters in the context of incentives.  If you use a spot exchange rate, contractors are incentivized to try to manipulate the exchange rate to receive a better payout, so we use the average of the exchange rate over the entire month a contractor bills for.\n\nFrom the perspective of avoiding complexity, it does not make sense to accommodate arbitrary payout terms.  The only reason we have been able to build the infrastructure we have is that we have been strategic about adding complexity.  It is incredibly easy to add too much complexity and turn a simple matter, e.g. billing for work, into a rathole.","signature":"3e1833148f3fc1dbc45b0839d2864750d744513ff26eafc83f8a2f80abfa542b8fc6629c31f4c80e16e2ca2237274b21ef7b7b67ec9f96cfb6d508b7582c0e00","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"36","receipt":"67ff3548377bec7a8d1c597d1c79fc5092829f6548268db6c8f89d7fb6d6c7114bd0295451b093dbb5e96b80fe4b23da6275f06a932525663ef0fcbe6f032e04","timestamp":1558809324,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
