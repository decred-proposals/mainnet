So that might need to be defined in the proposal. Perhaps there is some metric that can be used to define big enough? Or, perhaps it's not a binary, but a multiplier?

Part of the problem here I think, is that in addition to general resistance to paying for content, as expressed in other comments, Decred has never been, as far as I've seen, particularly focused on engagement metrics. So there's no precedent/formula to reference. Also, content like this is typically produced by existing community members or contractors that are paid in arrears (after the article is delivered). In that arrangement, the project isn't taking on risk that the article is hidden in Forbes somewhere, or that the author will just write one article and leave the project. If you were already a contractor, it is likely you could write this article and bill the Treasury for it, perhaps against the recently approved [marketing budget](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e).","signature":"84d6cabbec983f829b3783f75616963b54293e19ca1e76687b4edd4cf96ddf1cf85934b505d26dd9f9bd04839310884f7ae68fd85dd73c1ae3cf8bff909fb608","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"12","receipt":"7c45dcc3a9092d9d8db311236f37b53818f3e68082cf0b3648a5bac12a1448e8286b0917e501104a1f9a02ac33d36b8abc3bf3ebe539a5ec41911bb863e5330d","timestamp":1557636661,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Mea culpa and why I will revoke....I thought that Politeia as an experiment was a story worth telling, which was the motivation for the proposal. \n\nGetting earlier feedback may have spared you some time if you do revoke. However, I will point out that there are people in the project that advocate for having more of this type of conversation here on Politeia, where data isn't hosted on a 3rd party and is cryptographically verifiable. So in a way the content you're writing here is kind of a free meta article about submitting a (possibly) rejected proposal, which they will appreciate; as do I, I think this is actually an interesting idea to explore and am curious to see how it plays out. A larger concern is wasting stakeholders' time when they go to review proposals that are put to vote.\n\n\u003e After all, if the article sucked or it was put in a hidden part of Forbes or HuffPo, Politeia would be out 100 DCR...meanwhile, I would be out of any future opportunities.

Thanks for the offer/consideration re: contractor.  \n\nI am of the opinion that the Contributor Experience is going to be an important part of the marketing function of any DAO.

But the DCR payment is not just for me to learn how it is supposed to work, it is of measurable ROI to DCR b/c \n\n1) I will help others understand, through the story of Politeia that I proposed to write, how it is supposed to work so that high quality proposals show up\n\n2) I can highlight/make suggestions of Contributor Experience elements that, perhaps the community will consider should be executed.","signature":"494ffe5ccafb7c7c6fe2fe42ed06eff42b051b5bdf9b8ae1a180a6feb2883d1551d92a36879d189026755577115ff0541f1c8bac982ceb4c5ed2357673ba5908","publickey":"947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7","commentid":"14","receipt":"c9bdea6ac269946a8e3fcaeeb3456df35c82ad39ac6cc8b6f17da639d09995c488e5f3ab32631f094200df39308302c9e017b7b95b9aac1b8460f9c03c153302","timestamp":1557682662,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

For me, it's not a waste since the whole \"industry,\" if you will is a new one and I'm learning all along ;-)\n\nGiven the relatively scarcity of proposals, at the moment, it seems like a waste of stakeholders' time may not be the primary challenge right now, however, it is totally legitimate for down the road.\n\nI guess DCR will benefit no matter what. You are right. Since I am going to write about the experience of submitting a proposal to Politeia and either getting it accepted or rejected.  So, it seems like everyone should just vote against it b/c they will get it for free, right? ;-)\n\nI appreciate your nod to my sincerity and genuine interest in helping the cause. I suppose that is the reason why I would hope the community would vote in favor of it, because it values ppl who do want to genuinely contribute value, took the time to follow the proposal template, etc.  \n\nIt makes me think that maybe there's another avenue for would-be contributors...as in \"deliver value first, then get compensated.\"\n\nSo, for example, let's say my proposal does get rejected. I blog/write an article about it anyway and it generates some traffic, interest, whatever (it would be cool to have a referral link in Decredition that could track downloads stemming from my post).  \n\nThen, I could point to those number and either get tipped or some \"pay per download\" DCR after the fact.\n\nOf course, there's a risk there b/c if I write an article that generates a ton of traffic (for example) and ask for some comp afterwards, the community could always decide to not pay anything.  At the same time, that would certainly dampen my enthusiasm for future work, so there's some cool game theoretics there, right?\n\nAnyway, as you can see, I think about the broad concept of DMO/crypto-CRM (as I like to call it) a lot ;-)\n\nI'm probably going to submit to a vote anyway, because I am curious how this process plays out. I mean, I already paid my .1 DCR (sunk cost fallacy?).\n\nNo matter what happens, I'm cool with it, because of what I've learned about Politeia, DCR, the community, and crypto-CRM/DMO.\n\nSorry, that was a lot of a brain dump.

This is vetting consistent with the DCC process.\n\nHe has a proven track record indicating his ability to deliver results on this proposal. The cost associated is quite modest, but more importantly, the story he's proposing to tell is of great value for Decred to communicate. Politeia is uniquely Decred, and it's the mechanism by which we as a community determine what gets funded and what doesn't. The output and the process are both important, and Jeremy's telling of the story of the process could not only get Decred more awareness and reach in a tier 1 publication, it could provide a solid impetus for additional individuals and businesses to join our community.\n\nFurthermore, Decred is short on marketing talent and execution. We're in need of exactly what Jeremy proposes - people to see where they can contribute and jump in! We're a community of doers and Jeremy has already written multiple articles about Decred and now he's proposing this endeavor more formally. \n\nI think it's consistent with our ideals to vet and qualify as we've done to this point.

This proposal makes it hard to understand if you are merely doing an experiment of using politeia  or if you are genuinely interested in contributing to the project latter on.\n\nMost actual contractors have actually taken the opposite approach : (getting involved with the community first, discussing and contributing and then taking it a step further to become a contractor.) Almost a social equivalent of doing a \"proof of work\".\n\nThe cost of this proposal is \"relatively\" low, you have an interesting background and experiences and I may just take a chance and vote yes... still hesitating...,\n\nRegardless of the outcome, if you are interested in the project I would encourage you to get involved  with the community and make yourself known","signature":"5b8ad8cd7e891505c8d5db5fef9409af8d40a0ddb382ea3fb73aecaed6530d030e363da822c4033c4a45ad27480c6f1d58a4d32160a435a7012a3c5f83d1ff02","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"20","receipt":"7a16db8dacf1d6aefeefd02b7517d42a94ba792f7ce3b163eb653994854af482e29439f74333aa05e978fddb6d093b1bc40332b42992758a57d8b1bd59d1c406","timestamp":1558547303,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
