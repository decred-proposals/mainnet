So that might need to be defined in the proposal. Perhaps there is some metric that can be used to define big enough? Or, perhaps it's not a binary, but a multiplier?

Part of the problem here I think, is that in addition to general resistance to paying for content, as expressed in other comments, Decred has never been, as far as I've seen, particularly focused on engagement metrics. So there's no precedent/formula to reference. Also, content like this is typically produced by existing community members or contractors that are paid in arrears (after the article is delivered). In that arrangement, the project isn't taking on risk that the article is hidden in Forbes somewhere, or that the author will just write one article and leave the project. If you were already a contractor, it is likely you could write this article and bill the Treasury for it, perhaps against the recently approved [marketing budget](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e).","signature":"84d6cabbec983f829b3783f75616963b54293e19ca1e76687b4edd4cf96ddf1cf85934b505d26dd9f9bd04839310884f7ae68fd85dd73c1ae3cf8bff909fb608","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"12","receipt":"7c45dcc3a9092d9d8db311236f37b53818f3e68082cf0b3648a5bac12a1448e8286b0917e501104a1f9a02ac33d36b8abc3bf3ebe539a5ec41911bb863e5330d","timestamp":1557636661,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Mea culpa and why I will revoke....I thought that Politeia as an experiment was a story worth telling, which was the motivation for the proposal. \n\nGetting earlier feedback may have spared you some time if you do revoke. However, I will point out that there are people in the project that advocate for having more of this type of conversation here on Politeia, where data isn't hosted on a 3rd party and is cryptographically verifiable. So in a way the content you're writing here is kind of a free meta article about submitting a (possibly) rejected proposal, which they will appreciate; as do I, I think this is actually an interesting idea to explore and am curious to see how it plays out. A larger concern is wasting stakeholders' time when they go to review proposals that are put to vote.\n\n\u003e After all, if the article sucked or it was put in a hidden part of Forbes or HuffPo, Politeia would be out 100 DCR...meanwhile, I would be out of any future opportunities. IMHO, that's penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n\nIt would be penny-wise and pound-foolish only if Decred is a good fit for you and you decide to pursue those future opportunities. Which you can't find out IMHO until you start to contribute. You seem genuinely sincere and excited about the project. But tbh it's challenging and not for everyone. And you will have many other opportunities with your skillset and experience.","signature":"627f1292b768a868970ef3db5997addd1354b234b919db99482d3679539823ab65c734fadd2c095a06c471137471a8d9726704df5162065e22ab6c05ca142309","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"13","receipt":"a39bab16bd79d9041485613a6bcd469b711540d2d789ccdd4c5650887a506b9908b3616a1a67925aef5aa192412831e323684d52468a2e739a8f782f9d34c60e","timestamp":1557637991,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
