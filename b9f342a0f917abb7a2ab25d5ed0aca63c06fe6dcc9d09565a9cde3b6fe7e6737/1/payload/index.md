A Journey to the Future of Work- Telling the DCR story through Politeia
# What
The objective of this proposal is to increase awareness of Decred among mainstream tech and business audiences. 

The goal is to obtain a feature article about Politeia in a tier 1 media outlet while simultaneously positioning Decred as a unique and differentiated crypto project.

# Why
Two reasons. 

First, the power of the Politeia story. 

Second, market conditions are ripe for it.

Politeia is one of the most interesting and well-developed governance experiments in all of crypto-land. It represents a glimpse into the “future of work,” and an early example of what “[Machine, Platform, Crowd](https://amzn.to/2V0VWVw)” can look like when super-charged by crypto-economic incentives.

Its story deserves to be told from a business and marketing perspective. 

The article will be a “Politeia Travel Journal” from the perspective of a professional marketer who sees an opportunity to contribute to a project he finds appealing. It intends to be descriptive of a foreign place in much the same way that a travel writer would explain a distant land to his/her readers.

The article will: 

- outline the steps he took to navigate the Politeia process (which will be new and foreign to most readers)
- highlight the challenges he encountered along the way
- explain the process for submitting a deliverable for review
- illuminate the process for payment
- offer some lessons and suggestions for those who want to engage with Decred
- share some thoughts about the future of work

Essentially, the article will serve as a story about the creation of the story. (Very meta)

In addition to the uniqueness of the Politeia story, the timing for such an initiative is right. 

Skepticism and cynicism about crypto as an industry among mainstream audiences remains high. However, as the crypto winter begins to thaw, and mainstream investors and developers slowly return, an opportunity exists for top-tier projects to differentiate themselves and stand out from the crowd.

Awareness of Decred among mainstream audiences is essentially zero. The story of Politeia can serve as an interesting “hook” to introduce people to the core value proposition of Decred.

Furthermore, considering the relatively strong awareness of Decred within the crypto sphere, a non-technical story will serve as a project differentiator and perception builder.  This type of story will resonate with people fatigued from Bitcoin and Ethereum in-fighting. It may also serve as a catalyst for existing crypto people to consider investing, become HODLers, or possibly become a contributor.

# When
Since an article in a Tier 1 publication cannot be guaranteed, it is proposed that compensation be a 40/60 split, with the second portion being tied to article publication _within one month of submission_.

This is very much a “skin in the game” effort on the part of the proposer in an effort to align interests, while asking the DCR community to recognize the good-faith effort put forth in the creation process (as evidenced by the story creation process).

Upon approval of the proposal, the following timeframe is offered.

**Project Plan
**

- +7 days after proposal is accepted, a draft of story will be submitted to DCR community on Slack for feedback and commentary
- +10 days after proposal is accepted, a 2nd draft will be submitted to DCR community on Slack for final review
- +14 days after proposal is accepted, the story will be submitted to tier 1 publications
- +42 days after proposal accepted, proposer will submit proof of article publication for full payment or partial payment in the event that no article is published

If an article in a tier 1 publication cannot be secured, proposer will post to:

- [Never Stop Marketing blog ](https://www.neverstopmarketing.com/blog)(~10k monthly)
- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jer979) (14k connections)
- [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jer979) (6,822 followers)
- [Steem](https://steemit.com/@jer979) (315 followers)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@jer979) (1.7k followers)
- [Hyperspace](https://hyperspace.app/u/5c505f39be572d00069f312f) (14 followers)

If a tier 1 publication is secured, proposer will also post to these outlets after publication..

**Proposed total compensation:** 100 DCR

- 40 DCR for completion of article
- 60 DCR upon successful publication in Tier 1 outlet
