Why not Litecoin first? Is it more difficult to implement than BCH, or is it a best market decision issue that I am not seeing?","signature":"404c737ca8346b77e0d68d34a6189aaa35500ae763cb250c246b49b06664b017417ad0afd0a97b583a5d19bfc63e279b80e45968f62220d2b1301c04243a5704","publickey":"58270cbc020b58f49cd16253ccde81030a3efa51b431e46fc5799e2bbdb63ce4","commentid":"2","receipt":"e60bdbe3a1acd1b549e6477f0c89fac33e0869ef4867aa7049ac048b8f56a6cf2e9e1b00a5c64ba8e362d6d5a6be32fe95eb3a66c8b09d10c25dacb227e22503","timestamp":1609877996,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
