Decred in Spanish Marketing and Events Proposal

**Decred Latam Marketing and Events Proposal**

**What? **

This proposal is a continental effort of contributors in Latin America to grow Decred brand awareness, presence, and adoption in the region. The objective of this proposal is to have a dedicated budget for operations in Latam that covers marketing, creation of Spanish content, Spanish community outreach and operations in events across Latin America. 

A secondary objective of this proposal is to set a precedent of funding for a specific region in the world. We believe that this could be replicated in other regions of the world where there are strong Decred communities, and it’s a method that decentralizes marketing, while enabling local operators more autonomy to customize regional operations. This is a proposal to measure community sentiment over the work that we are doing in Latam, and to seek dedicated project funding.

The scope fo this proposal does not include Brazil due to language barriers. Furthermore, we recognise that the Brazilian community is several steps ahead from the rest of Latam in terms of DCR brand awareness, adoption and community size. 

**Why?**

Because 5 countries of the top 10 countries in the world where people own cryptocurrencies are Spanish speaking countries and also 5 are in [Latin America] (https://www.statista.com/chart/18345/crypto-currency-adoption/). As of today, we have a presence in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and we are looking to expand into Spain, Venezuela, Chile, Paraguay, Perú, Ecuador, Panama, Guatemala and Central America.

Furthermore, Latin America is a leading region of the world for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology adoption. From remittances, lack of financial services and notarization of digital information, to hyperinflation, there is a real need for  these technologies, and the time to promote Decred as the solution is now. 

**How?**

We are going to continue doing what we have done for the past year: Spanish content, marketing of Decred on social media, networking with key players in the region, headhunting talent, organizing and attending events. This proposal budget will cover everything from contractor hours, marketing materials (swag), travel costs and sponsorship/organization of events. 

**Who?**

This proposal will be executed by Decred en Español Ops: elian, francov_, adcade, victorarubin, luisantoniocrag, camilolwi and tomee. The team is distributed between Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. Decred en Español will headhunt more contributors in Latam, particularly in Colombia and Venezuela 


**General Marketing Strategy**

*Awareness - Adoption - Decred Expansion*

**Awareness:** Awareness and brand recognition of Decred will be at the center of our work in the region. The first target is to grow Decred’s presence among the crypto community that is already interested in digital currencies. The second aim is to expand brand awareness into potential new users of digital currencies. Our priority will be to target the existing community with a secondary focus on new audiences. 

**Adoption:** An intensive educational approach will be carried out by Decred towards Latam:

• Guides on correct use of Wallets.

• Use and understanding of Decred platform and blockchain.

• Brand awareness of DCR as Store of Value.

• Adoption of DCR as Medium of Exchange.

• Use and understanding of DCR for remittances and cross-border payments.


The idea at this stage is that new and existing users gain knowledge about the use of Decred wallets, DCR as a Store of Value and a Medium of Exchange are next level of adoption that we are looking.

**Decred Expansion:** The maintenance and the already established progress of Decred in Latam is sought thanks to the pillars that will be established in the previous stages.
 
The strategic plan of Decred en Español is created with a long-term outlook. Brand awareness is the first of our general objectives to grow recognition of Decred name among professionals and users of digital currencies.

**Full Monthly report:** the specific objectives of the established campaigns will be reflected mainly in the number of users, visits or scope and interactions on  social media. A monthly general report will be made to analyze the strategy in turn by means of metrics to evaluate the overall performance that has been obtained, with the purpose of maintaining or changing the strategic plan. Reports will also be made on the data collected monthly along with the reports of the proposal in general. Weekly meetings will be held for mutual agreement in the creation and evaluation of the campaigns that will created.


**User Support:** Decred user support format will be created as the first contact through social media so that they can efficiently solve technical problems and doubts about the project, redirecting to chat.decred.org for more technical or broad matters. 

**Contingency actions:** following expertise from DITTO PR on contingency action for social media we will maintain the same procedures in response negative interactions.

**Content creation:** we will place a lot of emphasis on this point, because it is key to carry out the first stage, the creation of content in format: video, audio, visual and textual with quality standards.

**Open source content:** one of our aims is to make open source content that can be translated into other languages in order for the community to take advantage of the content generated by Decred en Español.

**Digital Marketing:** in the area of ​​digital marketing, we have a simple approach with social media to propagate all content created from the events that are planned together with the native content from the team of Decred en Español. 

These will also be used as metrics for a record of strategic progress as well as a window of interaction for the community that includes from beginners to the most expert person on the subject of any gender and age.

Each social media has a specific purpose that serves as a strategy to diversify the information and share it with target audiences, allowing to reach more people from any sector, gender, etc. This allows Decred to reach for all kinds of audiences.

The purpose is to enable the expansion of the Decred movement, we want to emphasize the following goals:
* Grow audience keeping at least 10% engagement in all networks.
* Establish first contact connections with Decred’s new users
* Generate searches and captivate curiosity
