PlusBit-POS-App for Decred (DCR)

# **Introduction** #
So far, POS systems were being built using custom hardware, making them costly and less flexible. A new trend is emerging now. Business owners have started using tablets and smart phones as their POS terminals. PlusBit POS is an app based on Android platform, used by merchants and vendors for processing cryptocurrency payments. Make your tablet or smart phone Point-of-Sale (POS) system with PlusBit.

PlusBit is designed for merchants to be able to accept **Decred **quickly, easily, and securely. In order to further adoption of **DCR** we need to make it easy for merchants to accept it as a form of payment. This system will enable them to do so.

PlusBit eliminates the involvement of a third-party processor, allowing merchants to accept payments directly from their customers within seconds, in a secured and trustless environment. The deployment of the PlusBit POS system is anticipated to bring blockchain-enabled payment technology to the mainstream, while keeping the transactions seamless and cost-free.

Unlike custodial processors, PlusBit does not store or withhold any funds of merchants. It is an entirely P2P payment solution, with the convenience and benefits of a payment processor. PlusBit does not have access to merchant’s private key and money goes directly to their cold wallet.

Moreover, PlusBit doesnot get any fee from transactions. There is no monthly fee for merchant. PlusBit is completely free mobile Point-of-Sale app for everyone.

# **Advantages for merchants** #
According to our research, Decred has payment services for online shopping such as Cointopay and Coinpayments. However, DCR does not has "Point of sale" for real business. With PlusBit-DCR POS, DCR can have it's first own exclusive terminal! DCR ambassadors can extend payment network especially in LATAM, Thailand Turkey and Colombia.    

* **No Fee:** With DCR POS, merchants don't need to purchase hardware device. Also, merchants does not pay any mothly/annual costs. Morever, PlusBit does not get any fee from transactions. Completely designed for merchant adoption to accept DCR payments. We make the expense of merchants "ZERO".

* **Security:** PlusBit does not store or withhold any funds and private key of merchants. PlusBit does not ask merchant’s private key and money goes directly to their wallet. They have immediate ownership and full control of their money. Also, employees cannot control the coins.

* **Fast:** They don't need to wait sync like QT wallet. They get the payments quickly.

* **Global:** App supports multilanguages (En, Es, Tr, De, It, Ru), so merchants all over the world can use it. More language support will be added. They enter the sale amounts in their local currency (app supports 12 major fiat unit) and have them converted to an amount in Decred using Coingecko exchange rate.

As a conclusion, this project is designed for merchants to be able to accept DCR quickly, easily, and securely.

# **Why use this instead of a mobile wallet?** #

One of the main reasons a merchant would use this app over the standard mobile wallet would be to have an experience they are familiar with. It has been designed to be very closely related to credit card processing machines in this respect.

The main reason however, besides ease of use and familiarity, is the fact that this terminal is not a wallet. Several factors to consider;

* PlusBit only generates the payment requests to a wallet that the merchant controls on a different machine. This means that there is no control of the coins from the POS software. This situation works especially well when you have employees that may access this machine as well.
* Keeping your private keys offline is always a bonus!
* Your wallet may need time to sync.
* Unlocking wallet in front of customers is not safe.

# **Budget and justification** #

How much development cost, and what will the cost breakdown?

As a PlusBit company, we never get fee from transactions. Also there is not monthly/annual cost for merchants. The app will completely become free for everyone. This means PlusBit doesnot get any revenue. However, there is developer cost for us. So, we ask this fund from coin teams or community donation.

As a conclusion, what is the cost that you need to cover in order to go ahead with PlusBit app for coin?

Developer compensation: **$650 USD in DCR** (This is one time payment at the beginning and covers all the further developments, updates and maintenance).
