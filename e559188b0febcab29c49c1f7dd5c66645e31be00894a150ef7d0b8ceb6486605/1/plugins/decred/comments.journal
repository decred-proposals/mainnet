The third party, or the application itself, could be trivially compromised and feed the merchant false information.\n- The merchant will either need to insert a new DCR address for every transaction (incredibly inconvenient) or they will need to use a single address (really, **really** awful for privacy, particularly for a merchant using a necessarily public address). \n- The merchant will expect every customer to have a Decred wallet on their phone which is capable of interpreting a QR encoded invoice. AFAIK this software does not exist.\n- The system described uses on-chain payments. That means the merchant needs to wait for **at least** two blocks to be mined (~5-10 minutes) before they can have some level of confidence that the transaction is permanent. This is impractical in a retail environment. Advising people that the payment is safe in \"seconds\" is misleading and potentially dangerous.","signature":"3d5f831a32f4384a1b9d594a446ade50ab51e6fd8d3b088eb4cb0e823cbcb17b3b8f3ca320b6ae60272e32c64cd256338c9acc2c8b7669670fdb77649758b706","publickey":"237877644b69539b119287595e39e6c758a734d207dc24a47f78e231c04c6039","commentid":"9","receipt":"34d6fe4413d8f7b91a5a7eaa56527a0ca93a2fe383e77965b8e8175ca6b26196ab6a15fcac628002b43181470c96003547d5794c737adc2db0cf0b00a3ba0704","timestamp":1575121356,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A custodial wallet is a wallet in which your private keys are stored by a third party. Thus, you do not have full control over your funds, which makes ​these​ wallets a dubious choice. PlusBit is non-custodial payment service, it is not wallet and never hold your fund and private key and therefore are more secure.. Moreover, for merchants, using a \"wallet\" to accept coins is NOT a good solution. First of all, you don’t want co-workers to have access to wallets so you will want a receive only option. PlusBit offers this solution. Merchants never will be dependant for verifying its purchases.\n\n\n- Actually merchants will insert some DCR address at the beginning and then they will select one address for each invoice by using drop drown menu. But you are right, not for this version however in near future, we will change this and add the feature of automatic generation of new address for each payment. I agree with you.\n\n\n- Clients should use Decred wallet, otherwise how can they pay? Once QR code payment request is generated by merchant, clients scan the QR code and send the amount by using any DCR wallet. This is very easy step. Clients can pay via Decred mobile wallet, Coinomi, Exodus, Guarda, TrustWallet and more.\n\n\n- payments are confirmed between 15 and 45 seconds. But i agree with you here.

While a lot of projects design products using this feature, reusing addresses leads to serious privacy issues. In my vision, every cryptoproject needs to think and address it at the start.\n\nUser privacy: in order to generate a new address for every invoice, you probably need users masterpubkey, which means you can track every payment that the the user creates or receives with an address from this masterpubkey, including invoices made outside your app.\n\nThe Decred wallets don't have a URI to use payment invoices with amount and description. Therefore your users will need to use another decred wallet that accept your app invoice. At this point, we can't reach all decred users.\n\nPayments can't be considered secured before at least a few blocks are be mined (which takes an order of a few minutes).\n\nDcrData will remain forever, but using only this API, your service is being centralized, and if inactive, your application will be too.\n\nTL;DR\nI like the idea about DCR POS, but I think in this case Lightning Network works better from the users perspective. Maybe you can do in on-chain transactions, but you need a lot of work designing this system, think about security, privacy and use the best practices of crypto projects.\nAbout the proposal, it needs more details. Please search past proposals and see about how to write a good one, with more description about what you intend to do, about the team you'll bring to work on this and how many hours to implement it.","signature":"3e632c137d949e85484be38ffa289fb0d3771824bc1ba8d2d9bf61b4608d7b735f64e73e3f3f6879d68ca6e9684de65f8dcc8122eb26bfe22539b40d87d8f207","publickey":"0e0093a37c00d3ace30ccf165da000b9b842061ecdaa6f128bff48b5a63a1200","commentid":"12","receipt":"abffbcf2b4e6599dd92a6082c9fcc779cb5fb786bd9800acb5f7cedea25177493762855c21d60eeea82d5a2b4fd7cde39c1d3e9da0aa83d9c9871e361d4cbb06","timestamp":1575320716,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Merchants using your service will be dependent on a third party block explorer which is completely outside of their, and your, control.\n- Great to hear you will derive receiving addresses in the future.\n- *\"clients scan the QR code and send the amount by using any DCR wallet\"* - which wallets provide this functionality at the moment? I don't believe decrediton, dcrandroid or dcrios can do this.\n- Payments are not confirmed within 45 seconds. They may be observed in the mempool, but they are not **confirmed** until they are mined into a block, and another block or two is built on top of it. Mempool transactions may expire, or the same decred could be spent in another transaction which is mined first.  As somebody who is producing software for merchants, I  really recommend you get an understanding of this point - its pretty important!\n\nPersonally I will be voting against this proposal. Merchant adoption is a real problem, but on-chain transactions are absolutely not the solution. LN **could be** a solution, but that is still a long ways into the future.","signature":"ceb7b8302129b7427685a712b0ea6df953cf4f953f63fbc46ab4c55234c09ec74b34b01157816bc0430e6058f5d1a425e6b80c338ac3b5a9a50a3964a85e3e06","publickey":"237877644b69539b119287595e39e6c758a734d207dc24a47f78e231c04c6039","commentid":"13","receipt":"dd883bc2ad58186ea63a621d2044597ceb129da4bb9c09c3972b767c6ed2c6e3bdc6bfd382cb4e9142e3bc36f29954a0a9d1c0d1b618c2de083bfe2c04c45a00","timestamp":1575450507,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
