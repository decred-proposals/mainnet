We want to make merchant's expense zero. So, we dont get any fee from transactions and no cost for merchants/users. It means also no revenue from PlusBit. We just need to pay for our developers and we ask this fund from coin teams. \n\nWe have a roadmap  until 2020 regarding developments. Then, we aim to create one app which will include all listed coins together. After this, we will make it open source, we will not list any new coin and we will focus more adoption in our target countries like Turkey, Venezuela... of course we need here help of DCR ambassadors too.\n\nRegarding sustain stuff, please dont worry, we have enough fund, knowledge and great team for it.
