The third party, or the application itself, could be trivially compromised and feed the merchant false information.\n- The merchant will either need to insert a new DCR address for every transaction (incredibly inconvenient) or they will need to use a single address (really, **really** awful for privacy, particularly for a merchant using a necessarily public address). \n- The merchant will expect every customer to have a Decred wallet on their phone which is capable of interpreting a QR encoded invoice. AFAIK this software does not exist.\n- The system described uses on-chain payments. That means the merchant needs to wait for **at least** two blocks to be mined (~5-10 minutes) before they can have some level of confidence that the transaction is permanent. This is impractical in a retail environment. Advising people that the payment is safe in \"seconds\" is misleading and potentially dangerous.","signature":"3d5f831a32f4384a1b9d594a446ade50ab51e6fd8d3b088eb4cb0e823cbcb17b3b8f3ca320b6ae60272e32c64cd256338c9acc2c8b7669670fdb77649758b706","publickey":"237877644b69539b119287595e39e6c758a734d207dc24a47f78e231c04c6039","commentid":"9","receipt":"34d6fe4413d8f7b91a5a7eaa56527a0ca93a2fe383e77965b8e8175ca6b26196ab6a15fcac628002b43181470c96003547d5794c737adc2db0cf0b00a3ba0704","timestamp":1575121356,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
