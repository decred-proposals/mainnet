I personally am doing my very best to draw as much attention to the project as do what I can with my skillset. It takes alot of time and effort to develop these tools, which you may not find useful, but alot of people in the community seem to. As you can see, I did not add any billable items for my part in this project, it is purely for the web-dev and designers. In fact, on a non-billable to billable ratio in my own work, I probably only bill 30% of the time I spend working on Decred material to the treasury. I find myself on 1-2 podcasts per week, build community videos and meetups, post research on socials, discuss ideas on Matrix, write code for these charts and deliver the Our Network newsletter once a month --\u003e All non billed, free, zero cost, all paid for out of my own time because I want to deliver good work for the project. In fact I spend so much time on non-billable Decred work, I am struggling to spend my budget because i'm overloaded.

Seems like good value for the money. \n\nI'm wondering if you have any further thoughts around how you imagine traders will use these metrics. When I first joined the project, I totally had ideas of finding alpha in understanding Decred's unique ticket system, on-chain activity. I never got around to it, primarily due to barriers such as lack of data at the time (DCR had only recently launched on Binance and historical data was scarce), high slippage, and lack of infrastructure (at the time) to run bots written in python. Do you know of any traders already trading Decred with bots? Are they running into similar barriers I did? Can you speculate on the probability of traders using these metrics, and the avenues they would take (aside from traders in #trading using TA that presumably already use your stuff)?\n\nEven if the charts aren't actively used by traders, I think this is worth the cost. For current and future data-driven investors, general education, and premium \"top of the funnel\" content pulling people into the project--I distinctly remember Permabull Nino's articles being particularly fascinating when I was first going down the Decred rabbit hole, and it reflected well on the project that someone would be doing such deep, interesting analysis of the project.\n \n","signature":"2044cca7e4ffd50b5148da477e207149d5cd2f1f6e12d36173778cba72949249188ac1379972065096766b20a1640b551a7d326329d3e54ae975379cd0ecf00b","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"26","receipt":"286fd67a5d3be3cddeee2f857d9f281373a14005c40e8f95a470858c7666ee122d9571751224ec13dedda54f37a241ac95ff7a74ba44dcda82cb780b0fc51002","timestamp":1589940571,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Many firms and funds absolutely use these signals for trading and setting macro bias and whilst I do not have personal contacts, I do follow the discussions on socials and private chat rooms. These types of metrics certainly get a look in and I am excited to see once live, people sharing and using the tools. The likes of glassnode et al certainly get snipped and shared by high quality traders for BTC on the regular and I believe this is just another cog in that infrastructure machine dedicated to Decred.\n\nI agree, the quality of research from Zubair, Nino and others added a layer of quality that really shaped my original Decred dive.

Roughly speaking:\n\n1. Never forget that we build a _currency_, which is SoV and MoE, and _focus_ on that in our dev work (reliable and secure software with smooth UX) and outreach (message and targeting).\n2. Use DCR as _currency_ within our community. Contractors already do it by getting their paychecks in DCR. Extend that to receiving and sending tips and donations, fund small projects outside Politeia, sell your paintings for DCR like [@AGNFAB](https://twitter.com/AGNFAB1) does, etc.\n3. Train [ambassadors](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/48) and bring the message about this amazing currency to [real people](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#reach-people-to-whom-it-really-matters) who are tired of the existing system and are ready to try a better one.\n\nFor the last point, easy to get and share charts can help us demonstrate why exactly this currency is solid.","signature":"a2eccccf1d13465e798a224b90245df46c9ffdd5b4d0074d60dbc3ca22904b08a55b846eb936bab5a155d5136d889700f0994afeddde4d613eabd575ca957b07","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"52","receipt":"b66fe80e3245b9080821f232a2aabecd874c10cc2ca46836135ac0880e78bc36917cddb3d7ed6b2b6701c7989aa7b5669f3c88432107664c93d77a0e53ec7a06","timestamp":1590349089,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Instead I'd like to target people who deeply care about Decred's mission and principles (in the short term) and \"arbitrary SoV and MoE\" users in the mid-long-term.\n\nLong version below.\n\n#### Questions\n\nOpenness of deliverables:\n\n- Will the datasets generated by OnChain be openly available? If yes, in what form?\n  - Visualization is great, but having raw data is great too. It would support two use cases: other researchers could download and play with the data permissionlessly, and in case the site goes down/censored other people would have all necessary data to re-deploy it elsewhere.\n  - For example, I [requested](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrextdata/issues/187) this in dcrextdata but it seems to have no easy data download or an API. It is harder to add later if you don't plan for it.\n  - Here's a [prototype](https://github.com/xaur/social-media-data) showing how open data could look like and explaining the approach. The storage format is unusual and I'm sure it can be greatly improved, the PoC serves to show the principles.\n- What license or license family will the source code use?\n\nDevelopment - code reuse. I'm interested in minimizing the initial dev costs by reusing code whenever possible and future maintenance costs by not having the same thing done twice. In that regard:\n\n- We have quite a few charts implemented with the web stack by now: dcrdata, Decrediton, [dcrextdata](http://dcrextdata.planetdecred.org/) and soon dcrdex. Will OnChain reuse any of that code or build all from scratch?\n- Will OnChain reuse any code or APIs from dcrdata? If yes, which?\n- Will this require developing any missing features in dcrdata?\n- I understand the idea to not distract dcrdata/dcrdex devs for integrating new metrics into dcrdata, but did you consider forking dcrdata and build on top of it? It has storage, backend, websockets, charting, etc all figured out.\n\nDevelopment - content management. Implementing \"research blogs\" requires a content management and publishing system. One such system for collectinve blogging we have is Hugo-based [blockcommons.red](https://blockcommons.red/), which has very desirable properties of open source code and open content (Markdown texts and images stored in Git). Questions:\n\n- Did you consider simply publishing research blogs at blockcommons.red?\n- If not, what is the motivation to implement a separate platform?\n- How do you plan to implement it? Here I'm most interested in raw content being openly accessible and easy to clone (Git) vs paying for yet another closed easy-to-die database like [decredcommunity.org](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83).\n\nDevelopment - other:\n\n- Is there anything more specific than \"X years of experience\" and \"worked on project X\" for Pavel's development background?\n- Can someone share an outline of the tech stack and high level approach to be used? e.g. how will you store data on the backend, how will you cache it on the client, how will you make the charts fast (a known pain point in dcrdata)? I'd like to feel that the dev side of this project is in a good architect's hands.\n\nOperations and privacy:\n\n- Is operating the site included in the costs? If yes, for how long and what is the monthly cost?\n- Who will \"own\" site administration?\n- What data will the site collect from visitors? Please expand \"anonymized analytics\".\n- What invasive/tracking third parties will the site use? Will it include any third party scripts or fonts? Google reCAPTCHA? Will it take an \"easy route\" and hide behind Cloudflare (which is becoming a single point of failure and surveillance for the whole Internet)?\n  - I prefer websites that don't require any 3rd party requests and don't share their visitor data with _any_ third parties. It would be awkward to pay from Treasury for feeding surveillance companies the data of people interested in Decred. decred.org made active efforts to not do it.\n- Please elaborate what do you mean by \"Deployed with same standard as official Decred websites\".\n- Does this proposal include any content generation work like blogs, educational documents or videos, to be published on the site?\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Will there be a public API that researchers could query from their programs? (note that this is different from downloading an entire dataset)\n- Does \"DCR/USD volatility index\" fit into this project? I would like us to start including \"Decred as money\" users into the target audience of our messages and products. We keep avoiding them and focusing on investors and speculators, while \"electronic cash\" is the reason why crypto was started at all.\n\nI would appreciate if you could clarify any items asked above in the proposal document before it is \"signed\" by the stakeholders.","signature":"72f3f5041b7a31f947eead2277fa36a5faa88b6b5ceac123d155ac980be9243031b9d8c3a0bd93924b01ff288999339fa852c6947da3fe29b4b87bbb08b21602","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"54","receipt":"6d039528022abd7de935ca97502af892609ac90181c33850eff161ddca303d5608efa1e6cb080a892c091c77090b1eee1d8b928a003ab1fd5910fa0a32aafb03","timestamp":1590355858,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm getting less optimistic about spending on work that is not building our core products and that is not directly onboarding users (e.g. a possible \"Decred Ambassadors\" program). But it's not an issue for this proposal because I expect this product to be a good intelligence tool for informing stakeholders and for getting new people interested. I think this has more value compared to blog posts. Not because our researchers write bad posts, but because all our content gets very little views. Interactive and discoverable charts are fun and I expect that they will engage more people and yield images shared by people inside and outside of the Decred community.\n- Most team members have good track record of contributing to Decred and I'm confident about their skills. I'm not too familiar with Pavel and Stan yet, but since Checkmate will be responsible for overall delivery (I assume based on his ownership of this prop) it is less of an issue for me. Although it would be nice if they can chime in and say a few words about their background/vision/approach/plans for working on this project.\n- Proposing team sounds enthusiastic to bring it to completion.\n- Dual language support will force to lay the translation infrastructure into the foundation, vs hacking it in as an afterthought.\n- Price is good.\n\n#### Concerns and dislikes\n\n- If the \"Dark Mode\" is anything but trivial and very cheap, it should be out of scope for this MVP and could go in a follow-up proposal. It's good to plan for in the UI code though.\n- Amount of work might be underestimated.\n\nSpeaking of target audience, OnChain will serve everyone but I'd like to comment on the audiences pitched in this proposal:\n\n- This proposal mentions traders 5 times - even more than investors. I don't want to pay for helping traders get an edge. They are not building Decred, not doing ambassador work, not using DCR for SoV and MoE. Further, if their mode of operation is not \"minimize spreads, minimize volatility, maximize liquidity\" (which is a [useful service](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20190822-dissection-market-makers-for-decred.html#1-market-maker-is-doing-useful-work) done by liquidity providers), but \"extract profits from people who exchange for _real_, bigger spreads is good, more volatility is good\", then I'm strongly against feeding them with our precious and limited resources (on top of their existing profits).\n- I also don't see why we should explicitly care for \"institutional investors\" or treat them specially. I don't want to pay for pitching to hedge funds or anything like that. Not now at least. At this stage I'd like to invest in collecting more loyal early adopters and builders whose values are deeply aligned with Decred and who will not jump ship on next trouble.\n\nImagine that DCR collapses to $1. How many \"institutional investors\" and \"traders\" will quietly exit before the general public, and how many will stay with us to actually build the SoV/MoE/DAO? Mid-long term when Decred gets stronger I'd like to actively target arbitrary \"SoV and MoE users\" without any further specialization - people who want to _transition_ from an old broken system to a new better system, instead of squeezing more USD from their investement asap.\n\n#### Ideas\n\n- \"Save chart as PNG\" feature to help people share charts on the web. This will save time compared to making and cropping the screenshot manually.\n- Embeddable chart widget. Motivation is same as above. Maybe not in the initial release, but it's good to keep in mind when writing UI code and planning the API.\n- If you're after exposing the overall \"health\" of the network, consider presenting important off-chain metrics like node count, hashrate, trading volumes, amount of active GitHub contributors, etc, and/or incorporating them into derived metrics.\n- \"Decred OnChain\" does not reflect that the site will also take off-chain data into account. A bit more generic title like \"Decred Metrics\" would capture that. It's not a big deal though, and \"Decred OnChain\" is a good-looking title.\n\n---\n\nSince this comment took a few hours, I'll \"do what I [preach](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#value-transfer-network)\" and post my tipping address: DsomCEmgmrYpvLmNCRMCpEzrgvtKtfKiDse","signature":"e4b2344dfeac5fab09b1dc0a0ad380b0a895d4bb05d98d90b04ddcacc2fc5f5b1f5365276ec7f8429ad27ffecd170f407eb70533d0cf715f6c8e4c15dd21c10f","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"55","receipt":"81cc4a964c4af3fe3b0b63844262a3afd9fe78567ea3740022c4881183b9a182120fe30ea809482ef7a7a429686f0dd605e06acc86f8a7d752b8c780ac310f02","timestamp":1590355964,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I will try to answer succinctly what I can and will pass on the technical queries to the team to respond to.\n\n1. Datasets are all generated via aggregating coinmetrics + dcrdata apis. All code is open source and already written, as are the calculations. I would also like a csv download option and this can be built in (either this iteration or the next). All code for charts in in python on my github\n2. Research blogs - blockcommons is focused on governance aspects, this will be data driven. Different field, different aesthetic, different site\n3. Dev and Privacy - I will leave for Pavel to answer.\n4. Features - yes we can build volatility metrics. The reason for this site is we can go down any data driven path we choose. Dark mode is already coded into the chart suite and design has taken this into consideration. It could be something pushed to a later phase if required and just install the bones now.\n5. Investors and Traders - These are people, stakeholders and market participants like everyone else. They all operate on quality information. Flip this around the other way, if no investor or trader uses our data, then it is not worth much. We cannot influence who enters or exits, we simply aim to provide the highest quality data and research for anyone to use. They are a target audience because they are everyone who touches the asset as an investment.\n6. Ideas - PNG is available for plotly, the charting package, embedded charts is a good one, there is no limit to what metrics we display, limited only by our creativity. RE the name, We like Ammars idea of Decreducation to add some fun to the mix.","signature":"01e75e5f07e880cabd9be42c86bc8f1dba22bac50554b45318848581be67d03419311a9eb6bd37591ed5ab7fd0a2e27497a930281756ed6631a7aede28064f00","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"56","receipt":"a76334b99f95d6fcd8905a7ad94044ffb3185206bc87a92b7b3812a0f556a11c7a43fea88df7aab0401ca954595dd58b22c431817d53bb75b6d3689e8712450c","timestamp":1590360262,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Improving data visualization has been discussed a few times in the past since the research work has picked up, though nobody has yet followed up on this. So all in all I’m supportive of this proposal as I think this should greatly benefit all research efforts. Providing some bits of feedback:\n\n- On the UX side, the benchmarked sites are solid examples. The design drivers for meeting the listed objectives should likely be around the quality of presenting the research data, both in terms of what the experience of working with a single chart/research piece and its drawn components is like; as well navigating (and managing) an always scaling archive of research. \n- Reviewing the wireframes, on quick glance there's quite a lot going on there in terms of details which draws away from the focus as well notably  \"stakeholders vs investors\" macro tags seem like an obscure way to base the structure off. Unless there’s good reasoning behind it, I’d consider basing that off simpler and more traditional structure or keep it intentionally undefined and simpler until good reasoning can be worked out (e.g. based on the actual content populating the site). \n- As this seems very much like an MVP in nature,  I would recommend to ditch the dark and light mode + language support and put that time on purely working out a better UX – whether it's by doing more research to build up understanding on the use cases; doing validations with other contributors and leaving time for iterating and experimenting where needed. \u2028 \n- There are no concrete details on how this project will be maintained or followed up on, besides additional feature ideas. Correct me if I’m wrong but just maintaining it should be a chunk of regular work? \n- On the components – I’d recommend working with the piui https://decred.github.io/pi-ui/, as there’s also a bit of relevant work done on the dcrdata regarding various charting components, taking into account accessibility on color blindness, etc. https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/139 . My understanding is that the piui is the furthest developed of the different dcr gui’s, and there's attention and active work on expanding its use and improving it, ie. implementation to decrediton. Makes sense to base work off that, as in that way you'd also contribute to growing the ui and design assets for common use.\n\u2028\nWhereas I think the pricing for the scope of work is fine for the delivery, I find it problematic the way the hourly breakdowns and the team are presented. On the UX side, half of the items have a 3x variation range. Comparing with the dev work, which has no breakdown or descriptions of the work being made. This gives off a lot of uncertainty. Imo its fine to serve a pricing either as a fixed, value based, hourly or other methods, but either way should be done a bit more clarity. \n\nRegarding designers and front-end devs, there's no portfolios or case studies. Even a small portfolio of at least some 3-5 case studies on relevant and successful projects, which one can proudly stand next to, will tell a lot about the match and competence. Listing years of experience / unnamed project with big numbers / illustration work while proposing to work on ux and data vis. only leaves the reviewer a vague assumptions. Don't take this as anything dramatic though, the critique is meant to root a better practice for design matters in proposals.","signature":"a65ebbed2c5c56f669c9e6658ce6cf0174c870bc671e70c91b0a4fe99e47e7543d23769131ecc3e88762538fab430f749c17bdb353e70cf3361d18036566ae0f","publickey":"db0979d1b10a1180ceb3bc497132a98ea3d40ecbac1d2b8a1ab687039721146c","commentid":"61","receipt":"115f2c843663adc9468a12454b0551b6b373d684c9ff1d0a29847caa16b377c291adbae51823037f7eb432ccd7d6870e1f06d6bf76e6d368e1df467efd75a702","timestamp":1590413201,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
