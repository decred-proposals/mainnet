I personally am doing my very best to draw as much attention to the project as do what I can with my skillset. It takes alot of time and effort to develop these tools, which you may not find useful, but alot of people in the community seem to. As you can see, I did not add any billable items for my part in this project, it is purely for the web-dev and designers. In fact, on a non-billable to billable ratio in my own work, I probably only bill 30% of the time I spend working on Decred material to the treasury. I find myself on 1-2 podcasts per week, build community videos and meetups, post research on socials, discuss ideas on Matrix, write code for these charts and deliver the Our Network newsletter once a month --\u003e All non billed, free, zero cost, all paid for out of my own time because I want to deliver good work for the project. In fact I spend so much time on non-billable Decred work, I am struggling to spend my budget because i'm overloaded. Do with that what you will.\n\nI appreciate your perspective, and the ticket vote is what counts end of the day. This project is for a budget to the web-development and design, not the research. Please base your ticket votes on that side of the equation, not on what you think of myself and Nino's work as a whole.","signature":"f7e96e1e7bf52eb1791f6d6e427b9ed1de45bf6e9893a59c6e9b3bb690aaa259954fea93e2bc6bf6bdaaa0d887ab7ae9bab4ec451ad2f8b5bc1646ebb9252b0a","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"13","receipt":"ed14de7d287cd1ceec173a210a48ebe646f0bb79c65712b84b8303c3e77fb152e542e5c2d3bbd609d01901973a04f0ae09f9ad1e4312692c2fb21010317c7f01","timestamp":1589833822,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
