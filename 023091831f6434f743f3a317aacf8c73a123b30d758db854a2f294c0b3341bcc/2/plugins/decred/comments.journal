I personally am doing my very best to draw as much attention to the project as do what I can with my skillset. It takes alot of time and effort to develop these tools, which you may not find useful, but alot of people in the community seem to. As you can see, I did not add any billable items for my part in this project, it is purely for the web-dev and designers. In fact, on a non-billable to billable ratio in my own work, I probably only bill 30% of the time I spend working on Decred material to the treasury. I find myself on 1-2 podcasts per week, build community videos and meetups, post research on socials, discuss ideas on Matrix, write code for these charts and deliver the Our Network newsletter once a month --\u003e All non billed, free, zero cost, all paid for out of my own time because I want to deliver good work for the project. In fact I spend so much time on non-billable Decred work, I am struggling to spend my budget because i'm overloaded. Do with that what you will.\n\nI appreciate your perspective, and the ticket vote is what counts end of the day. This project is for a budget to the web-development and design, not the research. Please base your ticket votes on that side of the equation, not on what you think of myself and Nino's work as a whole.","signature":"f7e96e1e7bf52eb1791f6d6e427b9ed1de45bf6e9893a59c6e9b3bb690aaa259954fea93e2bc6bf6bdaaa0d887ab7ae9bab4ec451ad2f8b5bc1646ebb9252b0a","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"13","receipt":"ed14de7d287cd1ceec173a210a48ebe646f0bb79c65712b84b8303c3e77fb152e542e5c2d3bbd609d01901973a04f0ae09f9ad1e4312692c2fb21010317c7f01","timestamp":1589833822,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Seems like good value for the money. \n\nI'm wondering if you have any further thoughts around how you imagine traders will use these metrics. When I first joined the project, I totally had ideas of finding alpha in understanding Decred's unique ticket system, on-chain activity. I never got around to it, primarily due to barriers such as lack of data at the time (DCR had only recently launched on Binance and historical data was scarce), high slippage, and lack of infrastructure (at the time) to run bots written in python. Do you know of any traders already trading Decred with bots? Are they running into similar barriers I did? Can you speculate on the probability of traders using these metrics, and the avenues they would take (aside from traders in #trading using TA that presumably already use your stuff)?\n\nEven if the charts aren't actively used by traders, I think this is worth the cost. For current and future data-driven investors, general education, and premium \"top of the funnel\" content pulling people into the project--I distinctly remember Permabull Nino's articles being particularly fascinating when I was first going down the Decred rabbit hole, and it reflected well on the project that someone would be doing such deep, interesting analysis of the project.\n \n","signature":"2044cca7e4ffd50b5148da477e207149d5cd2f1f6e12d36173778cba72949249188ac1379972065096766b20a1640b551a7d326329d3e54ae975379cd0ecf00b","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"26","receipt":"286fd67a5d3be3cddeee2f857d9f281373a14005c40e8f95a470858c7666ee122d9571751224ec13dedda54f37a241ac95ff7a74ba44dcda82cb780b0fc51002","timestamp":1589940571,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Many firms and funds absolutely use these signals for trading and setting macro bias and whilst I do not have personal contacts, I do follow the discussions on socials and private chat rooms. These types of metrics certainly get a look in and I am excited to see once live, people sharing and using the tools. The likes of glassnode et al certainly get snipped and shared by high quality traders for BTC on the regular and I believe this is just another cog in that infrastructure machine dedicated to Decred.\n\nI agree, the quality of research from Zubair, Nino and others added a layer of quality that really shaped my original Decred dive.
