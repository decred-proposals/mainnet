Decred OnChain - A Research and Charting Resource

## Proposal Objective

A growing suite of *Decred's OnChain analyses are available, but they are spread across many channels in static form. It is desirable to bring the community live, interactive charts and analysis on a regular basis and consolidate the on-chain knowledge and research materials about DCR data in one coherent location.*

This Project aims to create a **live, interactive website that displays on-chain and performance metrics, charts, analysis and research.** The work completed by @checkmatey_, @permabullnino will inform the MVP product however any community analyst may contribute following discussion and PR merging. This resource will provide the community, traders and stakeholders alike with reference location for data driven insights and aims to be a complimentary resource [https://explorer.dcrdata.org/#](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/#) and [https://decredpower.com/](https://decredpower.com/).

The website will be desktop and mobile-optimized and will use the official branding of Decred.

**Objectives summary:**

- Central location to host data driven insights in the form of interactive **on-chain performance charts,** supporting documentation and research blogs to inform and grow the community knowledge base.
- Tool for **retail** and **institutional** investors, **traders** and, importantly, **Decred stakeholders** to provide data driven insights for making informed governance and investment decisions.
- Draw increased attention to the Decred project from community sharing data/charts in social channels, traders finding edge and bringing trading attention and providing a high quality resource for institutional research firms (e.g. Delphi Digital, Glassnode, BraveNewCoin etc)

### Motivation

A common piece of feedback from the community is 'where do I find this chart live?'. It is also commonplace for institutional newsletters and research to refer to outdated or simplified charts available in the public domain or misrepresent information by direct to application of 'BItcoin knowledge' to Decred, missing the nuance.

Permabull nino notes this in his Phase2 proposal currently under discussion:

- *Feedback was very positive for the [Decred On-Chain: Macro + Micro Outlook](https://medium.com/@permabullnino/decred-on-chain-macro-micro-outlook-12a26930623e) piece. Major takeaway is that there's appetite for charts, charts, and more charts on a more regular basis*
- *There's a big appetite from less technical folk to have Decred on-chain tools at their finger tips*

With respect to traders, there is quantifiable market edge to be found in arbitraging on-chain performance metrics for Decred (and any chain for that matter). By providing live accessible data and charts, traders can better take advantage of this and it is hoped this arbitrage can be an additional source of exchange liquidity and price discovery.

### Description of Website to be Delivered

This proposal aims to deliver an MVP product including the following:

- Landing Home Page with directory to interactive chart pages and research
- 5 MVP charts with associated short form blurb about each metric
- Curated research/learning hub with more detailed analysis supporting each metric is housed
- Dark mode and Light mode
- Dual language support for English and Spanish

Examples of similar websites developed which give a feel of what is possible are:

[http://charts.woobull.com/](http://charts.woobull.com/)

[https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/)

[https://digitalik.net/btc/](https://digitalik.net/btc/)

[https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=addresses.ActiveCount](https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=addresses.ActiveCount)

Charts are currently envisioned to fall into three categories:

1. **Pricing models** - block subsidy models, 142-day ticket sum, S2F model, Realised Price
2. **Oscillators** - Mayer Multiple, NVT/RVT, Miner Pulse, Puell Multiple etc
3. **Performance metrics** - Security Curve, Difficulty ribbon, 142-day Transaction volumes, transaction volumes split into regular/ticket/privacy etc

An MVP set of charts have been spec'ed out by Checkmate which will be presented on the first iteration of this website. Additional charts and research are in the pipeline, but this MVP set will give a good feel for what to expect. Each chart will have a higher-level explanation (for non-analyst) and direct viewers to a more detailed research piece (for analysts / chain "nerds").

See specified charts here - [https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/research_articles/checkonchain_charts/checkonchain_charts.md](https://github.com/checkmatey/checkonchain/blob/master/research_articles/checkonchain_charts/checkonchain_charts.md)

The website will be developed open-source and modular in design to enable faster iteration, community involvement and speed up the delivery of additional metrics a research in the future.

### Wireframes and UI/UX Concepts

**Sample analyses chart and chart interaction in Adobe XD** *(Note XD is pretty buggy about making interaction animations, but the main idea is there)* - (https://xd.adobe.com/view/10a42566-05fe-4bc1-6a00-8aaa2b6143f7-6695/)

## Timeline

If the proposal is approved, we aim for following delivery schedule

- Week 1-4: Finalization of design
- Week 2-4: Preparation work of the website
- Week 4-8: Implementation of the website, mainly desktop version
- Week 8-10: Website optimization for mobile
- Week 10-12: Finalization and integration of anonymized analytics

Python code back-end for the charts via plotly has already been largely developed by checkmate and thus only need modifications to integrate with the site.

## Budget

We disclose a transparent budget divided into individual pieces of work with respective amount of time required for delivery by our estimation.

1. OnChain charts, analyses and research will be completed as part of Checkmates existing Phase 2  proposal, thus having no additional cost. As discussed in Matrix Chat #Proposals, it was determined that this website was a sounder pathway than implementing charts in the explorer, aleviating load on dcr-data/DEX devs and allowing for faster iterations - **0 USD**
2. UX and UI design (Phase 1) - **3,000 USD**
    - 5-10 hours for product specs
    - 10-30 hours for high fidelity prototype
    - 10 hours for the production of the assets and optimization of the size of the assets (website load performance)
    - 10-20 hours for UI design and specs for the design library (focus on charts design)
    - 10-30 hours for fine tuning
3. Website development - **4,800 USD** from A to Z *(start to deployment)*
    - 120 hours of work from A to Z
    - Deployed with same standard as official Decred websites
4. Other work - 0 USD

**Total requested budget  7,800 USD**

## Envisioned future

The team has discussed possible future development of this portal for community discussion:

- Landing page expanded with a dashboard of metrics, similar to the explorer but covering a greater scope (also alluded to in Permabull Nino proposal Phase 2)
- Additional charts and metrics developed by researchers/analysts as they are created in the future.
- Embedded video explainer sessions similar to [https://youtu.be/NOyyAx6Ab_0](https://youtu.be/NOyyAx6Ab_0) and even a location for hosting live community AMA sessions/virtual meetups like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_COE9A-t3I&t=268s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_COE9A-t3I&t=268s)
- Community-driven blog or regular newsletter
- Additional language support
- Possible to add metrics for other networks like Bitcoin as an attraction for outside audience

We are happy to answer any questions from the community and look forward to the vote!

# What is it Called?

The working title for the website is the hyper-intuitive **Decred On-chain** however we seek community feedback on more creative names and ideas on what the site could be called.
