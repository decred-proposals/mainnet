Also, overall quality of your videos have room for improvement. \nBut I do want to encourage you to consider other options, for example creating Russian subtitles for videos created by Exitus and content by Decred Drive. \nI also looked at your articles on Medium, however I can't judge their quality since they're in Russian. They have low or no claps, unfortunately.\n\nOne of the best articles I've recently read about Decred and Sound Money is this one:\nhttps://medium.com/@Ammarooni/why-we-need-decred-an-inclusive-approach-to-sound-money-db2f990c107b?source=bookmarks---------2------------------\nIt would be awesome to have it translated to Russian.\nIt would be awesome to translate it to Russian","signature":"3eb7cdde94329069e3a056096c956a22afd9e95692d448d799995dfa3d97913a96e69af05312848b93c859c9b1a9af92d54b5f230838878de4dbe78da5e16004","publickey":"ab30c62fdee8ec6e89429481acd652a3501d166383ffd46b57fd9d65a4d2b138","commentid":"5","receipt":"ff3ccd128a9d592ec99f0b3f02543eefb19fcc880d1ae438d56f4eaa4d4a8d9aea2245a8562a3d962b68bae4a158dfcd8129d2cdfc7685d3ec0609242e6e5e0f","timestamp":1592767099,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
