Content Production for Decred in russian

# Summary

My proposal presumes funding for 4 months of video and text content creation/translation about Decred project and community in russian language. I am convinced there is high demand for this type of content based also on my own experience, since there is quite a little of this content on youtube now (most of it is outdated) and russian crypto community is pretty big. This will help educate and engage new and different type of newcomers.

# Why

As already mentioned above, russian community is pretty big (second language of the internet after all) and there is a noticeable lack of information. I intend to provide all the relevant and necessary information, including beginner guides, news updates, translating and explaining(when neccesary) other contributors' work.

# Goals

My aim is to deliver good quality, useful and interesting content for russian auditory. 

As long as the best quality and informative videocontent about Decred *(in my opinion) *on youtube is made by [exitus](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/95cfb73254a032b2c199c37bb499d6f172d044b1f38016279c5bbca6572251f0) for now, first of all, I intend to adapt all the content (with some exceptions like few old news updates that I missed before) he makes every month to the russian community.  I’m also planning to keep making my own content (I mean not only voice over), but since exitus makes good quality instructional/educational videos as well, I will make them less often, however I trust sometimes it's better to explain something with my own words. 

 I’m also going to translate articles from other Decred contributors, like Checkmate, Permabullnino, Richardred and others on my medium account.  And of course the articles mentioned in the video content in high priority.

I also consider posting this content at pure russian social networks like vkontakte, but I hope to get some more feedback about it first.

# How

This work generally includes:

- Translation
- Gathering relevant Content/Data/Research
- Filming
- Editing
- Feedback + Finalization
- Dissemination

# Who

I am a humble russian stakeholder since 2017, who was inspired by the work of other Decred contributors.

I have been making Decred related content for a while now. You can see [my youtube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjXbEDeyhhj2bH2t_eGKGA/videos).
And my [medium account here](https://medium.com/@ivandecredfan).



# Cost:

I will spend 20 hours a week working on video and other Decred related content.

At a rate of $25 USD/Hour this comes out to $2000 per month paid in DCR.
I also seek to be compensated for 1 month of work.

# When

Starting immediately and lasting for 4 months, after which I will create a Proposal for Renewal.
