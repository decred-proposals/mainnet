I am glad to see that you are taking another swing at it, but there are some problems with the proposal the way I see it.\n\nFirst of all, your proposal has changed very little since the last time you submitted it. You've borrowed the template for Exitus, but in your case you don't follow through with it, as the examples of your work I've seen include little in terms of scripting (as most of it is translation), filming (recording your screen), editing, and especially feedback and dissemination.\nYou received a lot of feedback regarding showing and proving your skills, and while you have indeed created some video explainers on Decred, they are mostly narration-style, which in my opinion is a bit sub-par. A good chunk of your video contribution has been translation of Exitus' work, and not original content creation. What's more, we are yet to hear from other members of the RU Decred community to see if your work is any good, since most of us do not speak Russian.\nFor this, I'm going to echo some of the past feedback you had received: it feels like you threw together some content mostly through* translations*, just enough to show that you can deliver (at a quality which, for now, is not evident) but expect to be paid like a *content creator*.\n\nI may be wrong, because I'm not present in all Decred channels all the time, but I don't see your presence in the Decred comms, asking for feedback like our writers do, or sharing the content you've created with a wider audience.\nYes, Exitus' work at the very beginning had few views, but he more than made up for it by hustling like crazy, promoting his work on social media, injecting his content into relevant conversations and asking for and taking feedback from people on what to improve, the quality of his deliverables and what they'd like to see made next, none of which you have done so far, from what I see, but please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nMoreover, I feel that stating your intention to work for Decred calculated as an amount of hours per week puts more emphasis on how much time you're willing to spend on Decred-related work as opposed to the level of quality you're going to deliver. Burning time is easy, but the Decred stakeholders are sensitive about how Treasury funds are spent. IMO the focus should be aimed at figuring out what the most valuable Decred-related content in order to spread it to people, instead of looking for just about anything Decred-related to fill a time quota, and at the moment, though there are new articles being produced, I doubt you will be able to find 80 hours worth of translation material month after month, which leads me to believe the quality of the source material you'd translate go way down, which is something I wouldn't support.\n\nFinally, the most severe problem with this proposal is that it's very heavy on translations. Right now there is an effort underway to cluster together all translation efforts under one proposal, which is why I feel that an proposal for a single language will soon make no sense, not to mention the fact that *no Decred contractor* is just a translator.\n\nTherefore, if you wish this to remain a translation proposal I will vote no. If you want to create content, follow in Exitus' foosteps, but most importantly engage with the community and the crypto social media, especially in your home country, because creating content no one sees will not gain you any following or recognition.\n\n\n","signature":"6ac2d3dc32a76e8d3e295f6e1571564fcdc8a7e57b4059e9cd4fefc2230d21ac9324389f6ec9e9e71c6b8a7015d511751fc152edd0f1d6dab7d2b5f915dbd205","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"13","receipt":"e7e7806602b7112257cef63d15034fcbe04c6e69834d3c352d8baac1a0e63e0c0afe4d144ac3a4352b089b30f52177fbb939125ba6dcf69bc981e411c168610c","timestamp":1592899617,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But the point is, that I intentionally switched to this after getting feedback last time, and later on matrix, that there is more than enough content already, and it would be better if I started to adapt the existing one.\nSpeaking of proposal, It mentions not only what I have already done, but also what I am going to do later. (I also have to note, scripting is not written there, for now)For example I can’t make filming right now, while I don’t have a proper camera.\n\n\nAnd your words about editing and time are quite offensive\n\n\nMaybe it doesn't seem so, but translating exitus' work takes a lot of time. Much more than making my own content. As long as you've touched upon it I will explain, that to make good quality translation I must listen to his every video several times, while writing down everything he said, \nthen translate it into Russian in writing form, then voice this text and not just in one piece, but in a bunch of small fragments, then edit it all, while sometimes I have to voice some pieces again, so that they fit timing better.\n\n\nRegarding my presence, the main problem is that my content is in Russian. If I come in chat rooms and ask English-speaking people to rate my video, translation of an article, or something else, that would be strange at the very least. While the Russian matrix chat is pretty dead now. Same with reddit, \nI had thoughts of posting notifications on main decred subreddit, but I decided that this was not the best idea and disrespect for everyone else.\n","signature":"e7efd0eb3477a23fd4c6dcc3ee4a8f3eb7a4c2cd6c5a614e4e82843b77d11e896760eede54e10c5140e74fe5f2a1c51f2464aaa3ad1a7e21477315a088e43b00","publickey":"c98646cf771f1c2fbbf2e81524ad6ea4f2d4e1acd72d7e2de7084a5cb5e09661","commentid":"14","receipt":"da1260261672948bd09b323939b93a69c23568c965fa25b4678514e8bf79535dc3965646140b2b8ef77bef6b40f4310aeada7fbb572e8e3ae7cd58dc22698f02","timestamp":1592909703,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
