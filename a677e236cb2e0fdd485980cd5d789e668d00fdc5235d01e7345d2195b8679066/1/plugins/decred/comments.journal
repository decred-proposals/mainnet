Easy yes for me after what you have delivered in phase 1, keep up the good work!\n\nBudgeting some time to help with getting new charts up on dcrdata is a great idea. I saw that you discussed it with the dcrdata devs in the relevant channel and they seemed ready to accommodate these new features. Might be worth adding a note about that in the proposal, or they could comment here.

I like the creation of specs and git issues; this is a real value add IMO, contractors are looking for work to do and scoping requirements and getting them ready to be worked on fills a great need. Your research has been amazing, and I refer to it all the time. I do think the risk you have identified is valid and it can potentially slow down your progress, do you have any ideas on how you can mitigate the risk of time due to the complexity/learning curve of of dcrdata? I do like the fact that the charts are being incorporated into dcrdata, it will increase its value as a one-stop-shop, but having alternatives that are easier to use for charts and analytics would be great and would allow for more participation.","signature":"5e5254e81d4f96aadbc11044a839c3695e6f247a448d1a1ad611aad6fbde3a7e66e5c7c87b80d7e4ac56effc914c0e4e602677a87aecfb64af2e97be970c270e","publickey":"c9eb83aa5260d858148a6d463b1e7ba458b06afc5eca5deeb5519e29b9791294","commentid":"14","receipt":"9b56e2d959b0b64774637f8b88e0d0a9440a4ead01807e047a43fbfa5b6b27f159ebd041681fa83d4587840ea9046f9847a8cbcfaf42c1418aeae0906fb12a0b","timestamp":1580850708,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
