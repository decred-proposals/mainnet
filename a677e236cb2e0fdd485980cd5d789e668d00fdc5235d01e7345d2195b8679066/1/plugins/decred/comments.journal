Easy yes for me after what you have delivered in phase 1, keep up the good work!\n\nBudgeting some time to help with getting new charts up on dcrdata is a great idea. I saw that you discussed it with the dcrdata devs in the relevant channel and they seemed ready to accommodate these new features. Might be worth adding a note about that in the proposal, or they could comment here. Proposals require support from the other contractors who are necessary to complete the work in order to be valid.","signature":"c4f7085bb5705e8974ac96ef7bf776753bfd9b729ef1734a14f305e430c48d916eae63e961f74a0805427d54434c5433c47bce782ad4de768a74e39ad2d8a50c","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"e9fdb173fab381e4c62999beb5af13b1902b93074c7c9b856884f04412e764cd3a25e3061c9efc0ddc99b8e5d5bb5dca00a056dd23d62e74cfcfd0d3817fe108","timestamp":1580745379,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
