Easy yes for me after what you have delivered in phase 1, keep up the good work!\n\nBudgeting some time to help with getting new charts up on dcrdata is a great idea. I saw that you discussed it with the dcrdata devs in the relevant channel and they seemed ready to accommodate these new features. Might be worth adding a note about that in the proposal, or they could comment here.

I like the creation of specs and git issues; this is a real value add IMO, contractors are looking for work to do and scoping requirements and getting them ready to be worked on fills a great need. Your research has been amazing, and I refer to it all the time. I do think the risk you have identified is valid and it can potentially slow down your progress, do you have any ideas on how you can mitigate the risk of time due to the complexity/learning curve of of dcrdata? I do like the fact that the charts are being incorporated into dcrdata, it will increase its value as a one-stop-shop, but having alternatives that are easier to use for charts and analytics would be great and would allow for more participation.","signature":"5e5254e81d4f96aadbc11044a839c3695e6f247a448d1a1ad611aad6fbde3a7e66e5c7c87b80d7e4ac56effc914c0e4e602677a87aecfb64af2e97be970c270e","publickey":"c9eb83aa5260d858148a6d463b1e7ba458b06afc5eca5deeb5519e29b9791294","commentid":"14","receipt":"9b56e2d959b0b64774637f8b88e0d0a9440a4ead01807e047a43fbfa5b6b27f159ebd041681fa83d4587840ea9046f9847a8cbcfaf42c1418aeae0906fb12a0b","timestamp":1580850708,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

For dcrdata, it is just a process of taking me from early coding experience to enough skill to dissect dcrdata. Once I get going, it will be all good, and Richard-Red is going through the same process + have the devs to bounce ideas off.  The main mitigation is that I just wear the time taken to upskill and in lieu of data driven research during that time, I can still develop armchair philosophy concepts to keep the content and outputs consistent.\n\nI agree, building out dcrdata charts will be a community wide benefit and I hope this will be the genesis of increased attention from outside and an attraction for new contractors.","signature":"80cebe68ea05e4c1f71639c7100d5a4e332e264b37867af255a1f7fb38f10e5dbfd91283a1665753fc8da693b4cfbca691deacd17b61f1160d19dec325a94a00","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"16","receipt":"f4640be0f916f0427d45c7c9c98a1eee1acbdd18bbbc9ad4bf9f777e7d2b01ecbeccf7b5aebb057fad7d44c94babe9bca7fd44039eece42edb0bf024b63b250a","timestamp":1580888549,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Furthermore, as somebody who has spent a substantial amount of time interacting with Checkmate, I feel very comfortable saying that he has some of the most unique insights on Decred / the crypto space at large. I very much look forward to seeing where his philosophical exploration takes the project.\n\nLastly - as a fellow researcher, and somebody who has found inspiration from other researchers within the project (such as RR, Ammar, Zubair, etc.), I think it is important to keep pushing the envelope on the research front. None of this research is standalone, it all is tied together and is highly complementary. On-chain analysis and philosophy is not only an emerging field within crypto, but also particularly for Decred. If we aren't going to incentivize passionate people already within the project, with a proven track record to do this kind of work - then who will?\n\nThat is all, and you have my full support hermano.\n\nNino","signature":"a7cf25d64bf882077de4bf8d4f556565ec8afd00dcafdd5ab43131da77944d4d3e3a0e08abc5d147dbab63640106163a130f1cac230e0ec0a1124755ac56630c","publickey":"8f9fa531b543c6e0b805a1abcc858400f8316cd937785c40e36f4d05171e83b5","commentid":"17","receipt":"37bf920a9391d61973fff47b3fb3bcfe42e0b604676133917bc6ff339e97d0240fa23ef1588b5d7a44c00c29693dbb24f90a0a97abf149594ec94dd5ee307402","timestamp":1580935476,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
