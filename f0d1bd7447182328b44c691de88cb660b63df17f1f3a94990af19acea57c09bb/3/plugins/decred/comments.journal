If I'm not mistaken only one of four fields of focus of his research is related to \"fractal identification\"\n2. If approved, Checkmate would ideally be one of my top sources for consultancy - he's a beast\n3. This work is highly complementary to his - when he identified the monetary premium relationship I for one wasn't surprised, as I had been sitting on my on-chain data already that proved to be very coherent. A lot of the work I've done can help lighten his load if anything so he can dig deeper on other topics. I think there could be a lot gained from both of us publicly working on this - Decred's chain has so much yet to be uncovered, and we can help each other dig deeper into it\n4. The detail I will be able to provide surrounding this _particular_ topic is tough to beat if I'm going to be honest - as far as I know I'm the only person who has been studying DCR ticket data as it relates to identifying market tops and bottoms for as long as I have \n5. If the community prefers to wait before approving a proposal like this, I have no issue with that at all.

It's not that I don't think your work would be valuable to the furthering of Decred, I just want the community to be careful about the following... **It would serve the Decred community well to not get in the habit of funding proposal owners for _past work_**. \n\nSeems like lots of community members are coming to Politeia to be compensated for _past work_. But **how does the community truly know a) how much work has been done in the past, and 2) what the value of this work truly is?** Permabull writes,\"I’m proposing work that has already been completed.\"and **It took me 12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it, all without pay.....** -- \u003eWhile the work Permabull has done is greatly appreciated, **He did all of this work out of his own free will at the time. My point is, he did not expect to be paid for this work at the time.**. **Because he did not intend on being paid for it at the time, it strikes me as slightly disingenuous to request funding for this work at a later date.** This feels very confusing and fuzzy to me. It would be different if the proposal did not reference work done in the past and simply laid out work that will be done in the future.\n\nI hope that we, as a community, can be careful about people coming to Politeia claiming to have done valuable work in the past, and then asking/putting out a **high price-tag** because of what they've done **in the past (while they were not expecting to be paid**.\n\n**Maybe the rules should be**: 1) If you do work and don't intend on being paid for it at that point in time, then don't ask to be paid for it later (there was some other incentive for you to do that work). 2) If you intend on doing work for the DCR community in the future, then then set out a plan, wait for the community to approve, and you will potentially be funded at a future date.  \n\n**In my opinion, it is crucial to recognize that it is unsustainable to continue paying contributors for past work**. My guess is that Permabull did this \"12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it\" because he is a HODLer of DCR. Sometimes that is incentive enough to do things. \n\nLet me be very clear: **I think Permabull can do valuable work and should be paid for future work, _but the price tag should not be higher because of the work that he has done in the past_. Although we appreciate past work, it is not the duty of the community (network fund) to compensate work that was done while the worker (Permabull) was not anticipating compensation.**","signature":"25630d95071b2d5095c152aab6fcb436caf7bbea25f410606392bf7be902d0262ff4af8b202dfc0e30b58e3190c9995c8b5a4e6e609584aa827c8430113cd00a","publickey":"d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec","commentid":"4","receipt":"2a85d7c1ce70c3b12e4244d8db4a59321a3f45b69884082eb1e03fad1fa6b43752d0e09e51526e80ce41e4d9453661624e5fa0179fdc01a0680575f674aca80a","timestamp":1567803358,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I expected some people to give pushback on the cost of the proposal. If people think it's too high then that's fine - but I'm not going to give this away basically for free. From an incentives perspective it just doesn't make any sense.\n2. The cost is high due to the opportunity cost portion - one portfolio adjustment to my DCR holdings based on this info can easily net me the full proposal funding amount in a single go of it. From my perspective, this proposal is cheap (I know for some that may be hard to believe, and that's fine).\n3. I'm not sure I follow your knock on coming to the table with work that's already been completed - to me it seems that it would be best to show up knowing the value of your work, and a completed product. But maybe that's just me.\n4. I don't need to do this work, I've been self employed for 2.5 years now and haven't needed a dime from anybody to stay afloat. However, I believe this work going public would be incredibly valuable for the project, and thus this is something I WANT to do. Point is I don't need the compensation, and I'm not begging for money just because \"meh worked for 20 months\", although it is something for people to consider. I know my work is high quality.\n5. You get what you pay for.\n\nHopefully this perspective helps.","signature":"dd5d2d21ef9e3cd4195e662cdb824915419a2d4d68111c4dae6e3364d4d612a8b1b3afb41ea6b4fb29ee5096e9d817161507e5652f899817c8b5589ce5136108","publickey":"1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731","commentid":"5","receipt":"d82d6abc622f31107364e52c809c6991d7da4e26a0d44160ae8a07b9a3d93072ffe8f9da2dd76ccb51ea5db3cbfb787df17119cb1ff12ac403320c50d845a80b","timestamp":1567804540,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is an important, emerging issue (contributors coming to Pi for payment), and I appreciate that this comment articulates a viewpoint other stakeholders have as well. As a contractor in the trenches, who is considering a similar proposal myself, I am naturally inclined to support this proposal. However, I’m more inclined to see the project be financially sustainable. And I’m open to the idea that this isn’t the best way to fund work. Below, I’ll hopefully provide some useful context by offering my personal take on the concerns raised.\n\n\u003e It would serve the Decred community well to not get in the habit of funding proposal owners for past work.\n\nSo in the current contractor system, which has been successful in bringing us to this point (including building Pi), independent contractors bill in arrears for all work. And they’re given the freedom to work on whatever they want. In return for this freedom, the DAO gets a screaming deal on labor. As @muststopmurad and others have noted, no other project gets as much done for as little money. Paying only in arrears is key to that. By only paying for clearly demonstrated value, with contractors taking on the risk of work not being valuable enough to invoice for (which is often, actually), the project can reliably reward the wins. Contractors coming to Pi asking for payment is arrears can be seen not as something new, but as an extension of this model. But instead of invoices being accepted or rejected by those that control the dev fund, based on their view of project priorities, that power is being ceded to stakeholders. I can understand why stakeholders would be balking at this. But I fear they could be killing the golden goose here. If highly skilled and experienced professionals such as permabullnino can’t be compensated for work that has clearly proved valuable, the incentive to work in the DAO is greatly decreased. \n\n\u003e ...it strikes me as slightly disingenuous to request funding for this work at a later date. This feels very confusing and fuzzy to me. It would be different if the proposal did not reference work done in the past and simply laid out work that will be done in the future.\n\nThis mix of past and future seems strange to me on one level. But in the context of the current transition we’re in (as detailed in above answer), it makes sense. He’s billing in arrears, which contractors are supposed to do generally. And also proposing a plan for future valuable work, which sweetens the deal for stakeholders, and perhaps soothes concerns over billing for past work (just speculating here, have never met permabull). In short, this expresses well the ambiguity of the process right now, which is in flux. \n\n\u003e 2) If you intend on doing work for the DCR community in the future, then then set out a plan, wait for the community to approve, and you will potentially be funded at a future date.\n\nArguably this is primarily what he’s doing. If this proposal had not mentioned billing in arrears, and simply used the past work as evidence he could deliver in the future, would you be voting yes on this? $16 for future work seems like a good deal to me. Then again, it’s hard to predict the value of work in advance… There’s risk he won’t deliver, risk the work will be delivered but won’t be used/valuable in the way he speculates it will, etc…If only we could just pay for what is delivered, once we have a clearer picture of the value the work delivered…which brings us back to, paying in arrears:) \n\n\u003eLet me be very clear: I think Permabull can do valuable work and should be paid for future work, but the price tag should not be higher because of the work that he has done in the past. \n\nWell, it does appear your comment has knocked $3k off the price. I do think that price discovery is very hard in cases like this, and that stakeholders could use Pi to negotiate. The main concern I have is that stakeholders may not want to spend their scarce time doing the hard work of valuing and negotiating every contractor’s work (and this is just the beginning). \n\nTo be clear, I’m not convinced this is the right way to go about this. But it is in accordance with the general plan of shifting control over the treasury to stakeholders. And I think permabullnino is providing value and following expectations as best he can.

This is in many ways ideal for the project, because the worker bears the risk and the stakeholders have a clear decision to make about whether the outputs, which are already known, are worth the requested amount. We want people to show up and do some substantive work before asking for payment, it's only fair that we pay them in arrears when the work is good.\n\nI do see a potential issue here with attaching a price to a piece of research work that is yet to be completed/published and is defined by a set of bullet-points. In the case where the work is delivered to a standard that everyone is happy with, it's obviously not going to cause a problem. In the case where there is a dispute between the worker and whoever is approving their invoices about whether the work has been adequately delivered, this kind of loose specification could be problematic.\n\nMost contractors working on Decred bill for their work at an hourly rate. When their invoices are being evaluated this anchors them to something tangible, number of hours worked. While this is not perfect, it offers a basis for dispute resolution: \"Does this deliverable represent X hours of work?\"\n\nI'm not suggesting there would be any issue with permabullnino's work specifically, but in the case where there was, the dispute could only be addressed in terms like whether the \"Evaluation of market cycles using HHP\" had been adequately addressed.\n\nCheckmate's recent proposal had a similar issue but to a lesser degree, as it was anchored to the idea that it was for 3 months of work. Checkmate explained that their contributions up to that point amounted to 1 month of work, so that gives a reasonable basis for an expectation of what 3 more months of work should look like. Checkmate also has a fairly constant presence, which also helps to make 3 months of their work time seem more tangible.\n\nWith this proposal the timeline of 3 months seems more incidental. It is not clear to me what the deliverables will look like, how many articles and how in depth they would be as compared to permabullnino's previous output. The first version of the proposal had a split of $3K for previous work vs $21K for future work, but now that's gone and it's not clear how much new work we should expect to see for the $16.5K to have been earned.\n\nI don't see an easy or obvious answer for how to handle these scenarios where the person making the proposal is not an existing contractor with an established hourly rate. In this case, as the work is already done and permabullnino just needs to \"put pen to paper\", some more detail on what kind of output to expect might be the best way to address the issue. For projects where the research is yet to be completed this would be more problematic, as it can be hard to predict how long a piece of research will take or where it will lead you.","signature":"9bf6daa03127eb6b03d95bb5f483c0509b9ae122ce1dd42451498cfcd55b14ca831ac57d9e81086041e215eb5e4bf105a3f4a28e32f12273f34f442b73599e00","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"15","receipt":"055243c7003f5299a005d26b577f122fab828c72e65483840715b63c403c355cb936fe3b9a86d5053a9bff764b58c5eedf5c58188a9ff0e87cda94045eac400a","timestamp":1568199339,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Funny enough, I thought that showing up with (1) work that I already knew was valuable/completed and (2) bullet points which define the topics to be discussed would be positives. However, it seems these things have muddied the waters for people a bit, which I will consider in the future.\n\nI totally understand people's concerns, and as a stakeholder I'm a huge fan of the attention to detail when it comes to dishing out funds from the treasury to fund work (especially for someone who isn't currently a contractor).\n\nIn all honesty, I get very anxious about asking people for money, which is why after some pushback for the initially requested $24k I lowered the amount down to $16.5k within 24 hours. In retrospect, asking for less and overdelivering is more in my comfort zone anyways.\n\nAs for past and future work - I know some people got chippy about me mentioning the amount of time I've put into past work, however I do think it's worth mentioning. When I started looking at DCR PoS on-chain data, nobody in the on-chain analyst community was looking at it or just in general going about looking at DCR on-chain data all wrong. A lot of my work was from trial and error without any other analyst's work to refer to. Fortunately moving forward, I have Checkmate available for ideation / inspiration. But the point remains, until very recently my work has been built from the ground up (which required _time_ and effort), and although it's \"past work\" it should be considered as a part of the proposal ask. \n\nNow, the 3 months requested in this proposal is partially incidental, but also somewhat necessary - I want to go into as much detail as possible and deliver the message with a level of quality that the Decred community is accustomed to. If I have to rush everything out the door within a shorter timeframe it might be more of a hack job. As you can see with my past work - I generally do not write quick reads.\n\nLast of all - like I mentioned previously, I hate asking people for money. I'm also very honest with myself, if I don't think I've delivered on my promise I will know it. If people like you don't think I've done my part, I'm open to discuss the payment. However, I will do everything in my power to make sure this isn't even an issue by pushing out the best research I possibly can.","signature":"4e6c706450086b6d1e09fd098f9002cc184f30641e8f91714dd60178a6b458f7ea0eedb2c660e6b79fd32e7869cf1083d9dd15ccc817fb11174de7c00356a801","publickey":"1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731","commentid":"17","receipt":"3de96e320afd51e7f2e70ced040fcdf3545df94e4f67429c2b25c132ea42091e4598605d43abd68be93e8fdc3e11d1634804e803cb25f9ceee2cff9c6ecc3103","timestamp":1568216243,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Contractors' individual hourly rates are not published, and it is not fair to expect prospective new contractors to define their work in these terms on the public Politeia platform if they are not comfortable doing so. My comment is not directed at your proposal specifically so much as the general issue it has landed in the middle of :)\n\nIn this case if the amount being requested reflects some component of work already published I think it makes sense to quantify that. Also I think an estimate of how many articles to expect and whether they are of the same sort of length as your previous work would fill in some blanks in terms of what to expect.","signature":"7c0dda7516f571ab526367a30c12c4aabc67d48c130172e43d08ea07f80a5f3ae5f72f4330c73138397e0926dcd0fe6be7aaad74c4c489ca48b9400fb455a007","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"18","receipt":"453fc9a5ee3fd740cafbcea7cd87d24ecfc327f47aec977c2b8538d05727a215f92379feec8002a6c45cb69f183c0f6e48a402c66ede261a03e2a20faf9fed0d","timestamp":1568221318,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But I'd say $3k-$3.5k for my previously published work specifically related to Decred (3 articles), which puts a per article value of $1k to $1.2k. \n\nWith this in mind - this project will have a minimum of 4 articles, and possibly as many as 6. The average length per article will be around my usual publication length (maybe even higher). Given the nature of the work, I'd say the value on a per article basis would be closer to $1.7k-$2k. If we assume I just land in the middle with 5 articles, the value of the articles in total would be around ~$10k. Past and future work considered, the remaining ~$3k would be allocated to previous research (which is where the ticket data findings mostly will come from) and future research in the 3 month project period (which will keep HHP work up to date, and include any additional findings related to HHP during the project period).\n\nBut like I've said, I'm not an expert at valuing these things on a per output basis in terms of how the contracting system does it and will probably be able to give better approximations with more experience","signature":"bf3e7bcd2aa484c2d0a9d32dfe7fa65f8e0da4a4ef9eb48be8fbdbcd9309468ee9339d28393d723f7d121162c3501475cf4c98b6473969703d84afaeacd49e04","publickey":"1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731","commentid":"19","receipt":"297f3d000d5f54c7081a5ba6ba46fd9090bee73b2fa71c13f3af54d826dd3e4acb2a2f8fdf083589c508f39b82c42f70d549a9171dfe983fecb5f60fde42e20f","timestamp":1568233476,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Have been a fan of Permabull Nino's work since I joined the project about a year ago. As I was going down the rabbit hole, his in-depth articles and analysis on the ticket price were yet one more fascinating tangent to go down, which taught me a lot about a complicated ticket system, and propelled me further down the rabbit hole. I think this aspect is important to note. Part of what sucks people in is just seeing really high quality work like this along the way. It teaches you a lot about the technology, but also acts as \"social proof\". The fact that someone obviously intelligent spent so much of their time obsessively going down this tangent nobody else was going down, and returned with deep insights and enthusiasm (and trading profits apparently), says a lot about the project. \n\nAnother thing to consider is a lot of work that isn't always visible. As a die hard supporter of the project, Permabull Nino has I assume had countless conversation/debates, for instance, with a lot of other intelligent, and sometimes connected people (e.g. muststopmurad). The value of that evangelism is harder to quantify, but shouldn't be discounted. Indeed, yesterday, his work was cited in another [investment thesis](https://medium.com/@wallyhansen/decred-an-investment-thesis-bf9ba3cd1042). To get a better sense of Permabull Nino's character, journey, and experience with the project, I highly suggest checking out his recent [Decred in Depth podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxECplK3kAs), an activity he was not, afaik, paid for. \n\nI do think there are valid concerns about if this is the best way to fund work moving forward, which I explore in my [response](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f0d1bd7447182328b44c691de88cb660b63df17f1f3a94990af19acea57c09bb/comments/4) to decredphilosopher's comment. I'm happy to see this discussion on Pi actually, as it will help evolve the system moving forward. I do think that voting yes on this is the right decision though. It's following the expectations put forward by the project (fuzzy as they are), offers good risk/reward, and either way gives us more data for future decision making.","signature":"06602c1ec95095cfdaab645e87da65d42e69bac4ce292011e91f7601b2cd9ed3c704f9fed9408803721b44cbd051422d91a5c884353e79664fa8cb9ae524cf09","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"21","receipt":"fe819f4197a7cd4d05397cfd772f3fea7b94ca66ae825c23942201c16b1eb2e54ca0caf3b7ad10f09132c481f50890839d6dd7a0135b21f638fce29fb8e84101","timestamp":1568308258,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I liked that part about fork risks \"am i looking at the right ledger\", \"does value change depending at what ledger im looking at\" in particular. I think splitting that is of a more importance than splitting community. Tho its pretty similar. Imo community is very important in the begging stages but with an adoption it should play less and less role. US dollar or UK pound dont have communities. Sound money shouldnt have communities. Thats where I think bitcoin will always get stuck with its community coz it depends on it due to fork beefs. And decred can actually outgrow its community thanks to fork resistance and depend only sound governance not a community. Just my POV. \nAnyway can you match checkmatey price tag at $12500? :) I will vote yes in a heartbeat! I mean i will vote yes even at $16500 but i think it would be more fair for checkmateys prop and his future work and he wont have side thoughts that he should have completed research and get a better deal after most of the work completed. I can be wrong tho","signature":"2e8c7d66bb6be471617d061071cc3b71adacfaeddc9e4722653ca5ea6545abb1f9217dac83af65625882800fc8760f1123857e73538c2f33140aa35301d31e0f","publickey":"f72039032f4b6e6ff2bbb9655c1859c195d143af330af2910c43f237d494ec8d","commentid":"24","receipt":"c11b0068d2c68178b4f3d80bd5861b7d9cbe9e18b70e2e96f67a35ac695a4c8df374ce0bd5968b12b08b8ae928d2f327ccb1e2e4322358693ae228c5d4c35b09","timestamp":1568363530,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As far as skin in the game goes, he has proven it undoubtedly. I see Nino and myself working collaboratively in the future to take this to the next level for the project.\n\nI also respect the stakeholder position that the work done to date is part of a personal investment strategy and therefore questions what is 'fund-able' by the Treasury.\n\nI see stakeholder reservation for payment for past work (similar to my own proposal). I believe that request for an in-arrears skin-in-the-game arrears payment is acceptable so long as it is clear what is included in that fee and that it represents the minority of the total budget (e.g. I requested 2k arrears out of 14k total). \n\n**The primary reason I believe Decred should support SOME value of in arrears payment is to attract the the best analysts who are willing to commit risk and time upfront as well as set community expectations of value for money. The proposal should however be dominated by an outlay of further work to be billed against. **\n\nNino, you have clearly established WHY the work has value and your papers to date speak highly to this. I believe the 16.5k asked is a fair value for your expertise and what you bring to the community. \n\nWhat I would like to see for clarity is:\n- The breakdown of what is in-arrears and what is the remaining budget you will be billing against.\n- The specific deliverables you foresee (are we talking 2-3 papers? A video explainer?)\n- How you plan to establish 'next steps' using this budget. What new opportunities does this open up?\n\nIn my opinion and with this clarity provided, the asked budget of 16.5k is fair and Nino will be a valuable addition to the Decred contractor community. I expect a strong collaboration following completion of both of our proposals to elevate on-chain analytics for Decred into the mainstream spotlight.","signature":"cfcd1cb42a6bfb3cdda7bf66dfe039b41ee6cf22f7f3f3c5d28249284bc46dd30d1b25ae2fb0132879d41754747bda475321b44be140ddd94e9cafb5f3161c04","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"25","receipt":"0385e6e0d9bb809cd80c64c36889408c0753225b38247d7233281fdc20fab2e9d0d0c146b988833e3033e5345efeb4484c0b6c472f7c7efb9cbd9cfd4c7b1104","timestamp":1568551538,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
