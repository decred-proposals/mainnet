If I'm not mistaken only one of four fields of focus of his research is related to \"fractal identification\"\n2. If approved, Checkmate would ideally be one of my top sources for consultancy - he's a beast\n3. This work is highly complementary to his - when he identified the monetary premium relationship I for one wasn't surprised, as I had been sitting on my on-chain data already that proved to be very coherent. A lot of the work I've done can help lighten his load if anything so he can dig deeper on other topics. I think there could be a lot gained from both of us publicly working on this - Decred's chain has so much yet to be uncovered, and we can help each other dig deeper into it\n4. The detail I will be able to provide surrounding this _particular_ topic is tough to beat if I'm going to be honest - as far as I know I'm the only person who has been studying DCR ticket data as it relates to identifying market tops and bottoms for as long as I have \n5. If the community prefers to wait before approving a proposal like this, I have no issue with that at all.

It's not that I don't think your work would be valuable to the furthering of Decred, I just want the community to be careful about the following... **It would serve the Decred community well to not get in the habit of funding proposal owners for _past work_**. \n\nSeems like lots of community members are coming to Politeia to be compensated for _past work_. But **how does the community truly know a) how much work has been done in the past, and 2) what the value of this work truly is?** Permabull writes,\"Iâ€™m proposing work that has already been completed.\"and **It took me 12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it, all without pay.....** -- \u003eWhile the work Permabull has done is greatly appreciated, **He did all of this work out of his own free will at the time. My point is, he did not expect to be paid for this work at the time.**. **Because he did not intend on being paid for it at the time, it strikes me as slightly disingenuous to request funding for this work at a later date.** This feels very confusing and fuzzy to me. It would be different if the proposal did not reference work done in the past and simply laid out work that will be done in the future.\n\nI hope that we, as a community, can be careful about people coming to Politeia claiming to have done valuable work in the past, and then asking/putting out a **high price-tag** because of what they've done **in the past (while they were not expecting to be paid**.\n\n**Maybe the rules should be**: 1) If you do work and don't intend on being paid for it at that point in time, then don't ask to be paid for it later (there was some other incentive for you to do that work). 2) If you intend on doing work for the DCR community in the future, then then set out a plan, wait for the community to approve, and you will potentially be funded at a future date.  \n\n**In my opinion, it is crucial to recognize that it is unsustainable to continue paying contributors for past work**. My guess is that Permabull did this \"12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it\" because he is a HODLer of DCR. Sometimes that is incentive enough to do things. \n\nLet me be very clear: **I think Permabull can do valuable work and should be paid for future work, _but the price tag should not be higher because of the work that he has done in the past_. Although we appreciate past work, it is not the duty of the community (network fund) to compensate work that was done while the worker (Permabull) was not anticipating compensation.**","signature":"25630d95071b2d5095c152aab6fcb436caf7bbea25f410606392bf7be902d0262ff4af8b202dfc0e30b58e3190c9995c8b5a4e6e609584aa827c8430113cd00a","publickey":"d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec","commentid":"4","receipt":"2a85d7c1ce70c3b12e4244d8db4a59321a3f45b69884082eb1e03fad1fa6b43752d0e09e51526e80ce41e4d9453661624e5fa0179fdc01a0680575f674aca80a","timestamp":1567803358,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I expected some people to give pushback on the cost of the proposal. If people think it's too high then that's fine - but I'm not going to give this away basically for free. From an incentives perspective it just doesn't make any sense.\n2. The cost is high due to the opportunity cost portion - one portfolio adjustment to my DCR holdings based on this info can easily net me the full proposal funding amount in a single go of it. From my perspective, this proposal is cheap (I know for some that may be hard to believe, and that's fine).\n3. I'm not sure I follow your knock on coming to the table with work that's already been completed - to me it seems that it would be best to show up knowing the value of your work, and a completed product. But maybe that's just me.\n4. I don't need to do this work, I've been self employed for 2.5 years now and haven't needed a dime from anybody to stay afloat. However, I believe this work going public would be incredibly valuable for the project, and thus this is something I WANT to do. Point is I don't need the compensation, and I'm not begging for money just because \"meh worked for 20 months\", although it is something for people to consider. I know my work is high quality.\n5. You get what you pay for.\n\nHopefully this perspective helps.","signature":"dd5d2d21ef9e3cd4195e662cdb824915419a2d4d68111c4dae6e3364d4d612a8b1b3afb41ea6b4fb29ee5096e9d817161507e5652f899817c8b5589ce5136108","publickey":"1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731","commentid":"5","receipt":"d82d6abc622f31107364e52c809c6991d7da4e26a0d44160ae8a07b9a3d93072ffe8f9da2dd76ccb51ea5db3cbfb787df17119cb1ff12ac403320c50d845a80b","timestamp":1567804540,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
