Research & Publication of On-Chain DCRUSD & DCRBTC Indicators




**Personal Introduction:**

For those who do not know me, I’m Permabull Nino and I’ve been a Decred community member since January 2018. Upon buying my first Decred, I immediately started tracking DCR ticket data and have been doing so every day since (~20 months of research). The majority of my contributions to date surrounding Decred have been focused on two topics:

- Research about Decred on-chain data, and
- Written pieces surrounding the novelty of Decred’s PoW/PoS security model and its ability to reliably account for value transfer / storage

I spend most of my time on these things because they’re irrefutably strong aspects of the project, so helping bolster understanding of them only help further harden the DCR hodl thesis versus any sort of detractors. 

A few pieces of mine include:

_Written Pieces_ ([Medium Profile](https://medium.com/@permabullnino))

- Assurances in Crypto
- Introduction to Crypto-Accounting: An Analysis of Decred as an Accounting System
- Bitcoin: An Accounting Revolution
- State of Decred, PoS Edition

_Podcasts_

- [Decred in Depth – Decred as Strong Accounting + Ticket Metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxECplK3kAs)

**Proposal Objectives:**

- Educate the Decred community and crypto space at large on Decred on-chain data
- This education will hopefully inspire members outside of the community to look deeper into Decred, and particularly its on-chain data
- Help further round out the Decred investment thesis by providing hard data showing coherent on-chain data for identifying market tops and bottoms

**Topics of Research & Publication:**

- Further research and publication of my most well-understood Decred on-chain metric: The Hyperactive HODLer’s Price (HHP)
   - This metric helps users evaluate the state of HODLers and ultimately manage risk throughout short and long timeframes
   - This will most likely be accomplished through a series of posts, which will include the following topics:
     - Explaining methodology / why the methodology makes sense
     - Explain how and why Decred’s ticket data is much better suited for on-chain analysis than other cryptocurrencies (also explain how DCR tickets work)
     - Analysis of HHP over multiple timeframes using a combination of ratios and price charts
     - Analysis of HHP for USD and BTC basis
     - Analytical tools that can be built around HHP
     - Evaluation of market cycles using HHP
     - Using to evaluate hidden support / resistance on price charts
     - Evaluate HHP on an absolute basis (hint: normally done on a percentage basis)
     - Discussion of the HHP Bullet Price: showing how Decred tickets are designed to be the center of gravity for the Decred prices
     - Show how the HHP can be used to identify market tops and bottoms for BTCUSD as well

**Why This Work Matters:**

Bitcoin has an entire suite of on-chain analytical tools which stakeholders from all corners of crypto tune into on a regular basis. These stakeholders check in to manage risk and to evaluate the health of the network (i.e. checking in on their investment). Further, on-chain analysts are constantly publishing work from their analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain activity, which not only helps harden the Bitcoin thesis, but it also serves as a form of viral / word-of-mouth marketing. Commitment to analyzing a coin’s on-chain data = more eyes on the chain, which in turn creates further buy-in to the project itself. It’s important we help people in understanding that not only does Decred have coherent on-chain data, but that it also has the HIGHEST SIGNAL on-chain data in the cryptocurrency space – which is a function of how the Decred PoS ticketing system is designed. Once people see what’s at play within the Decred blockchain, heads will start turning more towards Decred.

**Funding:**

- $16,500 – payment for project at large, billable monthly	

I recognize that my request is more expensive than the standard research proposal (although not by much after adjusting the ask downwards a bit :) ). This is why I consider this reasonable and a great value proposal for the community:

- It took me 12 months of research to make my initial discovery of the HHP, and another 8 months to build a full suite of tools / understanding around it, all without pay 
- There is a potentially big opportunity cost to publishing my research – as you would see in the posts, this tool is useful for short and long timeframes when it comes to evaluating DCR prices on both a USD and BTC basis. Although this isn't my full suite of DCR on-chain tools, it's certainly enough of it that I will lose part of my "edge" after publication
- I’m proposing work that has already been completed – pen just needs to be put to paper, so I already know what I’m providing is of the value I am requesting
- The value that the project will receive from the publication of this research will be more than ~$16.5k, as I believe it will help everyone understand that there is something incredibly special going on with Decred’s on-chain data and further help cement Decred as a legitimate and premium digital store of value contender

**Timeline:**

3 months

Every publication will have the most up to date state of HHP affairs, and upon publication I will more actively discuss items included in the articles via Twitter, Matrix, Telegram to keep the discussion going and help further educate people on the dynamics at play in the DCR ticketing system.

**Additional:** 

I will submit each article to a few Decred community members for review prior to publication to check logic and language included within. 

**Conclusion:**

I welcome all constructive commentary, and I look forward to engaging with the community on this.
