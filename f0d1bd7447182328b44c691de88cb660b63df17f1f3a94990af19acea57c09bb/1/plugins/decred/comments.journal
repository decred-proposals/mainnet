If I'm not mistaken only one of four fields of focus of his research is related to \"fractal identification\"\n2. If approved, Checkmate would ideally be one of my top sources for consultancy - he's a beast\n3. This work is highly complementary to his - when he identified the monetary premium relationship I for one wasn't surprised, as I had been sitting on my on-chain data already that proved to be very coherent. A lot of the work I've done can help lighten his load if anything so he can dig deeper on other topics. I think there could be a lot gained from both of us publicly working on this - Decred's chain has so much yet to be uncovered, and we can help each other dig deeper into it\n4. The detail I will be able to provide surrounding this _particular_ topic is tough to beat if I'm going to be honest - as far as I know I'm the only person who has been studying DCR ticket data as it relates to identifying market tops and bottoms for as long as I have \n5. If the community prefers to wait before approving a proposal like this, I have no issue with that at all. This is a win-win for me, as I either get approved and get to finally share some of my work with the community or I keep the work to myself and maintain part of my \"edge\"","signature":"eee0a1c008debe16748f360b2976bbe35726bece9e18413fd93dfc7d9207d8f4c042715e8a2f98522cc9c601316b5f66217a93b6a1036919045696f2a7a92f0c","publickey":"1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731","commentid":"2","receipt":"f820d3032e5e962e1ed802e4c6280cc705c875f8478d2fc732f8c72377d722de12e111feaf7ae0753043de48ddff67062acf29e176efd432ba3d725e10099206","timestamp":1567782033,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Permabull Nino is the person who introduced me to DCR when I was a skeptic and who made me realize its potential. He has (1) written the strongest bullish cases / articles for DCR, (2) has the most elaborate onchain / ticket indicators specifically tailored to DCR and (3) perhaps most importantly, was the person who made me and all my friends understand how money acquires its moneyness due to ledger guarantees - a concept which was extremely enlightening. He is one of the strongest DCR marketing/promotion forces out there.","signature":"c48fc85603017d6574b849fa584d0e15ff6b1e5bdf234c4281f805d9711b02192af2e4fe418205fc80ab1e12b4ea15345c4cfb40ad9ef166a1ae3504961d1d02","publickey":"4b2bab16615e64d67eda6359d85b7c9bcf81be0bdb491e00ccabddab1cf734b6","commentid":"3","receipt":"3978d0c819515803204746ddc09386ea0001f03331868996ea8248841341b2641922ac0884b40170b293b8e5980db2ae8206822f1a57cd64bb5a98e8b754d409","timestamp":1567788777,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
