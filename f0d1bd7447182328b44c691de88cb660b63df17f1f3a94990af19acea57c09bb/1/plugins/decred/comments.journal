If I'm not mistaken only one of four fields of focus of his research is related to \"fractal identification\"\n2. If approved, Checkmate would ideally be one of my top sources for consultancy - he's a beast\n3. This work is highly complementary to his - when he identified the monetary premium relationship I for one wasn't surprised, as I had been sitting on my on-chain data already that proved to be very coherent. A lot of the work I've done can help lighten his load if anything so he can dig deeper on other topics. I think there could be a lot gained from both of us publicly working on this - Decred's chain has so much yet to be uncovered, and we can help each other dig deeper into it\n4. The detail I will be able to provide surrounding this _particular_ topic is tough to beat if I'm going to be honest - as far as I know I'm the only person who has been studying DCR ticket data as it relates to identifying market tops and bottoms for as long as I have \n5. If the community prefers to wait before approving a proposal like this, I have no issue with that at all. This is a win-win for me, as I either get approved and get to finally share some of my work with the community or I keep the work to myself and maintain part of my \"edge\"","signature":"eee0a1c008debe16748f360b2976bbe35726bece9e18413fd93dfc7d9207d8f4c042715e8a2f98522cc9c601316b5f66217a93b6a1036919045696f2a7a92f0c","publickey":"1b71a61a2b246e60a358f3a3a9f19704e8dece58ca58f2955b1774b522bbc731","commentid":"2","receipt":"f820d3032e5e962e1ed802e4c6280cc705c875f8478d2fc732f8c72377d722de12e111feaf7ae0753043de48ddff67062acf29e176efd432ba3d725e10099206","timestamp":1567782033,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
