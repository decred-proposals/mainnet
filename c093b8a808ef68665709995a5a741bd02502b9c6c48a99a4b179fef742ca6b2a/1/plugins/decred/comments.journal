Some concerns that others may agree on:\n- how large are some of these communities? are there enough speakers in the decred arabic and polish communities to even warrant spending thousands of dollars on translations for these languages? \n- what is stopping people from using google translate for their translation needs? the translations are nearly *perfect* these days.\n- not to sound harsh, but almost everyone living in the first world who has the money to invest in crypto currencies can understand english....\n\nall in all the asking amount is just way too high especially with the current exchange rate. On a yearly basis you are asking for $80.000 USD! DCR would be better off if that $80.000 was put to proper marketing instead of random translations that very few people are reading. please change the budget to something reasonable.","signature":"d38323799d428e5b0229c52d9e2bf96607767f7552eb12da0fa9ad1ebcca2eacbffe438bb97db5ad9773fd71b215bfc46a39bb692040a4ea7977b8e44893430c","publickey":"3b0a2899b6d7525a55392d1848c66d0ec5eeb3f53e2811a0b33f473d261540d4","commentid":"2","receipt":"89a9ce038fa0c97f7246450401e25676f29d9651f7d900b36b36e5948725d44e35e3f4040eec789238de49d35618792136875a6f3d17f256d3d095acf446df05","timestamp":1602594435,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The best way to get a rough idea for it would be to look at meetups, for example, which before C19 were quite common and regular in Poland, and I wish I could have attended more at that time. More than a way of catering to an already existing community, which is fine in its own right, I personally see this initiative as a way of reaching out to potential newcomers to crypto, as a wealth of knowledge about a project can help attract and ease them into it.\n\n* nothing is stopping people from using automated traslation, and I'm sure many do, but there are some aspects where a _good enough_ translation that gets most of the gist across is, well, not good enough, e.g. official recources, websites, marketing briefs and materials, etc. There are many things automated translation is still struggling with, and I'm sure there'll still be plenty of time before all the kinks are ironed out, as languages just keep changing. Besides, the few times that the Decred Project  tried to crowdsource translations I believe it was found out that machine translation was used in quite a lot of them, which unfortunately produced sub-par results. Good translation comes from not only a good command of a language, but also a deep understanding of the subject matter, which I believe most Decred contractors have demonstrated so far.\n\n* this is true, and while I have done a few meetups and presentations in English in my own backyard, they were mostly for a more technically-savvy audience, and I think underestimating the aspect of availability of resources may hinder local community-building initiatives, which so far have been pretty successful in the case of BR and LATAM. I don't expect everyone who displays values similar to those help by the Decred Project to be able to speak English; in fact,  strong regional communities are an example of a step towards further decentralisation.\n\nWhile I'm grateful for your questions I respectfully disagree that the budget we ask for is way too high. I have made several efforts to highlight the fact that this is the maximum budget for this initiative, which also considers the opportunity to expand it further, and all funds which are not spent will remain in the Treasury, with possible additional caps on individual spending to minimise the burn rate. Unfortunately, the numbers I've given are based on incomplete data, as not every contributor contributed work in all areas outlined by the proposal, and the total is an extreme extrapolation of what it would roughly cost if all contributors were to put in the average amount of work in each aspect of the proposal per month. While I don't believe we would come close to exhausting the budget completely, the amount asked is a measure against going over a more modest but accurate spending projection, like the one we've witnessed in the case of at least one past proposal, which is something I would personally like to avoid .\n\nMoreover, if you have suggestions on what you would like to see scaled back or removed I would be happy to hear them as long as they are concrete and specific.","signature":"1f0503aa63bb185c66201d3960be0a7ed82b916f83fb5d58cc8a24a6e5fcaa66a0d256854183690d7ed24551415cf691ae731d74d90c04f5a1d2b2a4882ddb0e","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"6","receipt":"af202fabddb65025d6a774ed5b7224f6272181c51e491ccbd6ed0d200fe0a1b0474b675ae81dd6d4d15375ff3880a73d4fd175f061659890b70dc8c0cc99000f","timestamp":1602610998,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
