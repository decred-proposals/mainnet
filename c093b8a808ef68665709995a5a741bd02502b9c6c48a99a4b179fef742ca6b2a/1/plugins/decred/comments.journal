Expanding the reach of the community is crucial to the long term success of the project.\nFunds seem fairly reasonable and all proposed individuals are long standing contributors with a well documented track record that speaks for itself.","signature":"43ce57d116fc47933b7bb85c70183bcacb1d6bded77160d3d6839eac7bee4e18b9a4c3bdffdd8bef0ada7cdd6f0e6a310bd230b9987ddf3b8b3a0d6778627e0d","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"1","receipt":"e5638c59ed6e409fbc41067409ae46c953b0236e68b7fcf6ead868be27b2b480b8aa2a278ce50c1e5557a9d8ace102c2c724e2d9b47ea0455a3420c6bc84eb0f","timestamp":1602531285,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Some concerns that others may agree on:\n- how large are some of these communities? are there enough speakers in the decred arabic and polish communities to even warrant spending thousands of dollars on translations for these languages? \n- what is stopping people from using google translate for their translation needs? the translations are nearly *perfect* these days.\n- not to sound harsh, but almost everyone living in the first world who has the money to invest in crypto currencies can understand english....\n\nall in all the asking amount is just way too high especially with the current exchange rate. On a yearly basis you are asking for $80.000 USD! DCR would be better off if that $80.000 was put to proper marketing instead of random translations that very few people are reading. please change the budget to something reasonable.","signature":"d38323799d428e5b0229c52d9e2bf96607767f7552eb12da0fa9ad1ebcca2eacbffe438bb97db5ad9773fd71b215bfc46a39bb692040a4ea7977b8e44893430c","publickey":"3b0a2899b6d7525a55392d1848c66d0ec5eeb3f53e2811a0b33f473d261540d4","commentid":"2","receipt":"89a9ce038fa0c97f7246450401e25676f29d9651f7d900b36b36e5948725d44e35e3f4040eec789238de49d35618792136875a6f3d17f256d3d095acf446df05","timestamp":1602594435,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The expectation that a non native english speaker would seek Decred out and do their own translations in English trivialises the value here.\nIf we are serious about proactively expanding the network and appealing to people in their native languages then perhaps your views may be different.\n\n Perhaps the budget can be brought down by finding semi-automated ways to do translations such that the hours spent on each task areas go down?
