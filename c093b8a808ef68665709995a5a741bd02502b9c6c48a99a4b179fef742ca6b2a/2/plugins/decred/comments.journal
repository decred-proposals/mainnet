The best way to get a rough idea for it would be to look at meetups, for example, which before C19 were quite common and regular in Poland, and I wish I could have attended more at that time. More than a way of catering to an already existing community, which is fine in its own right, I personally see this initiative as a way of reaching out to potential newcomers to crypto, as a wealth of knowledge about a project can help attract and ease them into it.\n\n* nothing is stopping people from using automated traslation, and I'm sure many do, but there are some aspects where a _good enough_ translation that gets most of the gist across is, well, not good enough, e.g. official recources, websites, marketing briefs and materials, etc. There are many things automated translation is still struggling with, and I'm sure there'll still be plenty of time before all the kinks are ironed out, as languages just keep changing. Besides, the few times that the Decred Project  tried to crowdsource translations I believe it was found out that machine translation was used in quite a lot of them, which unfortunately produced sub-par results. Good translation comes from not only a good command of a language, but also a deep understanding of the subject matter, which I believe most Decred contractors have demonstrated so far.\n\n* this is true, and while I have done a few meetups and presentations in English in my own backyard, they were mostly for a more technically-savvy audience, and I think underestimating the aspect of availability of resources may hinder local community-building initiatives, which so far have been pretty successful in the case of BR and LATAM. I don't expect everyone who displays values similar to those help by the Decred Project to be able to speak English; in fact,  strong regional communities are an example of a step towards further decentralisation.\n\nWhile I'm grateful for your questions I respectfully disagree that the budget we ask for is way too high. I have made several efforts to highlight the fact that this is the maximum budget for this initiative, which also considers the opportunity to expand it further, and all funds which are not spent will remain in the Treasury, with possible additional caps on individual spending to minimise the burn rate. Unfortunately, the numbers I've given are based on incomplete data, as not every contributor contributed work in all areas outlined by the proposal, and the total is an extreme extrapolation of what it would roughly cost if all contributors were to put in the average amount of work in each aspect of the proposal per month. While I don't believe we would come close to exhausting the budget completely, the amount asked is a measure against going over a more modest but accurate spending projection, like the one we've witnessed in the case of at least one past proposal, which is something I would personally like to avoid .\n\nMoreover, if you have suggestions on what you would like to see scaled back or removed I would be happy to hear them as long as they are concrete and specific.","signature":"1f0503aa63bb185c66201d3960be0a7ed82b916f83fb5d58cc8a24a6e5fcaa66a0d256854183690d7ed24551415cf691ae731d74d90c04f5a1d2b2a4882ddb0e","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"6","receipt":"af202fabddb65025d6a774ed5b7224f6272181c51e491ccbd6ed0d200fe0a1b0474b675ae81dd6d4d15375ff3880a73d4fd175f061659890b70dc8c0cc99000f","timestamp":1602610998,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The video bucket is fairly eye-watering though, at $20,790 for 6 months that's more than the cost of Exitus' video production proposal. I gather that the video content is being translated in 2 languages now. Unless you think it's likely to expand to 7 soon after the proposal is approved, the budget is likely to be much too large. It might be worth trimming, as I expect you might catch some No votes from stakeholders who see the $20k for video translations figure and do not follow the reasoning for it being that size, or the reasons it's unlikely to cost that much.","signature":"b9b56bd690709e1b8fc88114160b864b267aed55169c6fb162283ef4ae4898626a21604a6ec0d7a4ce789220a2ae16c90727d6b3bcf64d06b043c3b36f539000","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"7","receipt":"c4438513e1ad2fc8493d5e8ca47c0fe4242595c6da8744508031ebf3b48c1fdc67d4bdfc468d7cda98514306351899d39a0a2a117b4b150883006ddd6e96b309","timestamp":1602719526,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

New people were welcomed into the chats, questions were tirelessly answered and help was given with onboarding the software. As we all know this trend has changed. Decred steps towards the promise of the DAO, the pressure has increased. Online campaigns became the tool of choice, contacts with publishers and journalists were expanded and professional PR agencies were hired. My personal experience has shown that direct personal contact, presence at meetups, talks and active discussion is the most effective way to get new people interested in Decred.\n\nThe community continues to produce an outstanding output, the supporting performance in my opinion does not come from obscenely overpriced PR placements. If you compare the quantitative and qualitative output Grassroots/PR with the costs, 6 month/magazine placements can translate the complete Grassroots output for 3 years and make it more accessible internationally. Providing a proper history, documentation, UI/UX and key articles in international form can greatly reduce the barrier of first contact. Outlets in my native lingo are open and crave for more content. \n\nBy working on dcrweb and managing the last translations I know that the proposed languages can be sourced through contributors. I am therefore pleased that these activities will be taken further. Especially as they will be budgeted, billed and started with established community translators. I would be happy to help with translations into german and help with the administration of the translations.","signature":"ef9fefe1ad207afb00c3c81c8727b0d3754ad721bb6a87daedd9bec7e60b7a9aa8549b9d4a60389f515b254918d55831d2822ba822b5dd93b5c806198e6d170f","publickey":"287a2fa6df23f0cf1ffabf5572e83a6738c670643bb7060d7bfb270fce9e34aa","commentid":"8","receipt":"036f0dca40d9fa07849463b7036c5e426b91dd79e0c05ff26ce4ea9d9372552d6394bdb65d7e15abab83dcac36dfa1ba12c45fb7094a36f89fc1f65c3ca4c20e","timestamp":1602760238,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Does a system like this already exist in some OS repo? This would be capital invested upfront with long term payoff.

When I was doing the research to put this proposal together I jumped at the total projected cost of continuing to provide translation output in this particular area. As I figured the proposal would go through a round (or more) of feedback and discussion I thought I would include the maximum projected cost in order to see where exactly the stakeholders would like to see our output trimmed, which I would be more than happy to do.\n\nI am going to reach out to our contributors to get additional information on their output in this area to get more granular data, because these figures were collected some time ago and I reckon we would all benefit from learning what exactly their focus was. I think that narrowing down the scope of work in whis particular area is of primary importance to make sure that only the most \"heavy-hitting\" content, for lack of a better term, is being worked on to provide the best cost-to-result ratio and prevent less-than-optimal spending.\nI believe that if we were to ask Exitus for his scripts he would be happy to help us out, therefore saving us a lot of time and money in the process.","signature":"3e04e8b36c8032d6aec682665d36feed6da1a06a79da1f0c05a30fb82b39b9130c70bb4bf705fca1e133d7bac57387ae43ef0d93c7eb441869e187d5c3cdb40c","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"11","receipt":"ea019fa0dceaf60fdbb52a6927f74907bc04c50e27adc395ff1a6bfc5d74856ab5c42c0c073e834cb80d48834b0a5821ec20094ffeb225e8db12b1c2b695d80b","timestamp":1602837759,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Moreover, as we can see by looking at the Treasury balance, something the website developed from your own proposal tracks, it shows growth and accumulation of DCR even in the face of the dropping exchange rate. This fact,  coupled with the fact that the proposal seeks to use the budget as the maximum cap for all translation-related operations and not earmarking all of it for spending, makes me confident that provided it is trimmed appropriately after receiving sufficient feedback from stakeholders it will be a decent addition to all current marketing and outreach initiatives, even after factoring in the fact that it is simply making a piece of on-going Decred operations  more transparent by bringing it to Politeia and explicitly asking for the approval of its budget and scope by the community.\n\n\u003e I also oppose the proposal and management fee. I have never seen this in other proposals and believe this kind of stuff should be labour of love and strictly unbillable.\n\nAgain, I disagree, but maybe I need to explain what I mean by this more clearly, but TL;DR, **this is not the cost of writing up the proposal**.\nHaving never managed a proposal that involves other contributors (or any proposal whatsoever, to be clear) billing against it I've requested additional funds to cover for work spent reviewing invoices made against it, making sure that expenses stay reasonable, deliverables are catalogued appropriately, and everything runs smoothly enough to avoid going over the prop budget.\nThere is work underway to implement proposal billing caps in CMS, I believe, but in case it turns out insufficient enough to do what I'd ideally want it to, and there is some need for manual review, I reckon 2 hours worth of work per month (tops) is a small price to pay for the value added.\nAs for your second point, degeri's approved [Decred Bug Bounty Program: Phase 3](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2170df6) cointains the following billing item:\n\u003e Any other non-bounty expenditure like emailing, bookkeeping, writeups, etc.\n\n, which I see as a similar cost of operation, hence the reason for its inclusion.\nI hope this clears up any and all misunderstandings.\n\nAs for the point about translation automation I agree, *it would be lovely* if a system like that existed, but unless you can point us to it or submit a counterproposal in this area yourself this is not the approach that we are putting forward here.\nHowever, to expand on your point, which I think is very valid here, I don't know about other contributors, but personally I make use of CAT (computer-assisted translation) to cut down on work time and therefore reduce the cost extensively, and all my translation billings reflect the time it took to complete them **with** the use of CAT already.\nAs you say, machine translation is good enough to get the main gist across, a point which I believe I've already addressed in a different reply to a comment, but unreviewed, uncorrected for incorrect word choice, sentence syntax, stylistic devices, grammar, etc., and unpolished has no place in a project as professional as Decred.\nThink of this, would you rather have a non-English crypto enthusiast or investor read a translation of one of your research papers translated by someone who knows the subject matter to try and do it justice, or one that was chucked into a machine which mistranslated highly-specific terms or messes up the syntax or context?\nIf our project-related output is forever, especially on the Internet, which goes double for the resources the Decred stakeholders are already paying for though proposal funding, I reckon they deserve to be done right.","signature":"8a8791a7cc054981fa2e3c93cd7ac9de36138decd587b212383e1a71f283d21352918ef65b86008ac357ce3c0e1b37640e94ab9a1cf839bdcb78e6f24240450a","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"12","receipt":"c394b54acaa42f3f21719a4972882e5400f96cafa6b910aca1917aca826ea8d68b2ab71683bd6e9927bde38c62f2c31960cbfcb10ada0a65fead4cdbae128204","timestamp":1602840188,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

First, I would like to introduce myself:  I started working on Decred almost a year ago now with DCR Comic, a project we worked with Pablito not long ago. Currently, I am collaborating with different designs for the LATAM Marketing team, and I also collaborated in the UI of dcronchain.com.\n\nI want to cover my experience about working on translations.\n\nBefore collaborating on YouTube content for Decred en Español, I came out with the idea of subtitling Exitus’ videos. I had honestly never done any translation work on video, so I completely ignored how long it actually takes: out of a 10 minutes video, it took me about 6 to 8 hours to finish.\n\nThe main reason is that in addition to the work of timing each phrase, it was the way to translate certain words, and I can only imagine that it may be similar in other languages:\n\nWhen talking about 'Proof of Stake', in Spanish, the literal translation would be: 'Prueba de Estaca', where 'Stake' refers to the weapon 'stake', and not to the 'risk of betting on' as it really means in this case in particular.\n\nAnd this is just an example, there are many other different cases that depends a lot on the context. This is the main reason why the translation quality is better than the literal translation performed by platforms like YouTube (at least in spanish)\n\nHowever, IMHO I do not consider the translation work to be charged at the same rate as a designer or a developer. I think the job should be charged between 15/h to 20/h.\n\nFrom my experience of doing 3 translations in 3 different videos, although translating video takes clearly more time than translating an article, I think we could at least review the hourly payment in this case.","signature":"e7ab1380236529ea24958f2533a0bf2aa3b7770a614024392c2422e1b83d0cdc5344fc5fe20493c09f39485950c5ea7b195d8d60892a108e983d798d28071609","publickey":"5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765","commentid":"13","receipt":"2199d97ceb89ea7f2d7a3c0cde843f4f352de785973f714eac27ff2feac0e2d480fc45373dc4e8ddeccd2b77e39aef810caa1ac2992343155bb418c2d00c8c09","timestamp":1602857426,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
