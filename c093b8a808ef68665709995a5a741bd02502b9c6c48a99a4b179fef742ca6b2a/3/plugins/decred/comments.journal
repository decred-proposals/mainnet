The best way to get a rough idea for it would be to look at meetups, for example, which before C19 were quite common and regular in Poland, and I wish I could have attended more at that time. More than a way of catering to an already existing community, which is fine in its own right, I personally see this initiative as a way of reaching out to potential newcomers to crypto, as a wealth of knowledge about a project can help attract and ease them into it.\n\n* nothing is stopping people from using automated traslation, and I'm sure many do, but there are some aspects where a _good enough_ translation that gets most of the gist across is, well, not good enough, e.g. official recources, websites, marketing briefs and materials, etc. There are many things automated translation is still struggling with, and I'm sure there'll still be plenty of time before all the kinks are ironed out, as languages just keep changing. Besides, the few times that the Decred Project  tried to crowdsource translations I believe it was found out that machine translation was used in quite a lot of them, which unfortunately produced sub-par results. Good translation comes from not only a good command of a language, but also a deep understanding of the subject matter, which I believe most Decred contractors have demonstrated so far.\n\n* this is true, and while I have done a few meetups and presentations in English in my own backyard, they were mostly for a more technically-savvy audience, and I think underestimating the aspect of availability of resources may hinder local community-building initiatives, which so far have been pretty successful in the case of BR and LATAM. I don't expect everyone who displays values similar to those help by the Decred Project to be able to speak English; in fact,  strong regional communities are an example of a step towards further decentralisation.\n\nWhile I'm grateful for your questions I respectfully disagree that the budget we ask for is way too high. I have made several efforts to highlight the fact that this is the maximum budget for this initiative, which also considers the opportunity to expand it further, and all funds which are not spent will remain in the Treasury, with possible additional caps on individual spending to minimise the burn rate. Unfortunately, the numbers I've given are based on incomplete data, as not every contributor contributed work in all areas outlined by the proposal, and the total is an extreme extrapolation of what it would roughly cost if all contributors were to put in the average amount of work in each aspect of the proposal per month. While I don't believe we would come close to exhausting the budget completely, the amount asked is a measure against going over a more modest but accurate spending projection, like the one we've witnessed in the case of at least one past proposal, which is something I would personally like to avoid .\n\nMoreover, if you have suggestions on what you would like to see scaled back or removed I would be happy to hear them as long as they are concrete and specific.","signature":"1f0503aa63bb185c66201d3960be0a7ed82b916f83fb5d58cc8a24a6e5fcaa66a0d256854183690d7ed24551415cf691ae731d74d90c04f5a1d2b2a4882ddb0e","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"6","receipt":"af202fabddb65025d6a774ed5b7224f6272181c51e491ccbd6ed0d200fe0a1b0474b675ae81dd6d4d15375ff3880a73d4fd175f061659890b70dc8c0cc99000f","timestamp":1602610998,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The video bucket is fairly eye-watering though, at $20,790 for 6 months that's more than the cost of Exitus' video production proposal. I gather that the video content is being translated in 2 languages now. Unless you think it's likely to expand to 7 soon after the proposal is approved, the budget is likely to be much too large. It might be worth trimming, as I expect you might catch some No votes from stakeholders who see the $20k for video translations figure and do not follow the reasoning for it being that size, or the reasons it's unlikely to cost that much.","signature":"b9b56bd690709e1b8fc88114160b864b267aed55169c6fb162283ef4ae4898626a21604a6ec0d7a4ce789220a2ae16c90727d6b3bcf64d06b043c3b36f539000","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"7","receipt":"c4438513e1ad2fc8493d5e8ca47c0fe4242595c6da8744508031ebf3b48c1fdc67d4bdfc468d7cda98514306351899d39a0a2a117b4b150883006ddd6e96b309","timestamp":1602719526,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

New people were welcomed into the chats, questions were tirelessly answered and help was given with onboarding the software. As we all know this trend has changed. Decred steps towards the promise of the DAO, the pressure has increased. Online campaigns became the tool of choice, contacts with publishers and journalists were expanded and professional PR agencies were hired. My personal experience has shown that direct personal contact, presence at meetups, talks and active discussion is the most effective way to get new people interested in Decred.\n\nThe community continues to produce an outstanding output, the supporting performance in my opinion does not come from obscenely overpriced PR placements. If you compare the quantitative and qualitative output Grassroots/PR with the costs, 6 month/magazine placements can translate the complete Grassroots output for 3 years and make it more accessible internationally. Providing a proper history, documentation, UI/UX and key articles in international form can greatly reduce the barrier of first contact. Outlets in my native lingo are open and crave for more content. \n\nBy working on dcrweb and managing the last translations I know that the proposed languages can be sourced through contributors. I am therefore pleased that these activities will be taken further. Especially as they will be budgeted, billed and started with established community translators. I would be happy to help with translations into german and help with the administration of the translations.","signature":"ef9fefe1ad207afb00c3c81c8727b0d3754ad721bb6a87daedd9bec7e60b7a9aa8549b9d4a60389f515b254918d55831d2822ba822b5dd93b5c806198e6d170f","publickey":"287a2fa6df23f0cf1ffabf5572e83a6738c670643bb7060d7bfb270fce9e34aa","commentid":"8","receipt":"036f0dca40d9fa07849463b7036c5e426b91dd79e0c05ff26ce4ea9d9372552d6394bdb65d7e15abab83dcac36dfa1ba12c45fb7094a36f89fc1f65c3ca4c20e","timestamp":1602760238,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Does a system like this already exist in some OS repo? This would be capital invested upfront with long term payoff.

When I was doing the research to put this proposal together I jumped at the total projected cost of continuing to provide translation output in this particular area. As I figured the proposal would go through a round (or more) of feedback and discussion I thought I would include the maximum projected cost in order to see where exactly the stakeholders would like to see our output trimmed, which I would be more than happy to do.\n\nI am going to reach out to our contributors to get additional information on their output in this area to get more granular data, because these figures were collected some time ago and I reckon we would all benefit from learning what exactly their focus was. I think that narrowing down the scope of work in whis particular area is of primary importance to make sure that only the most \"heavy-hitting\" content, for lack of a better term, is being worked on to provide the best cost-to-result ratio and prevent less-than-optimal spending.\nI believe that if we were to ask Exitus for his scripts he would be happy to help us out, therefore saving us a lot of time and money in the process.","signature":"3e04e8b36c8032d6aec682665d36feed6da1a06a79da1f0c05a30fb82b39b9130c70bb4bf705fca1e133d7bac57387ae43ef0d93c7eb441869e187d5c3cdb40c","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"11","receipt":"ea019fa0dceaf60fdbb52a6927f74907bc04c50e27adc395ff1a6bfc5d74856ab5c42c0c073e834cb80d48834b0a5821ec20094ffeb225e8db12b1c2b695d80b","timestamp":1602837759,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Moreover, as we can see by looking at the Treasury balance, something the website developed from your own proposal tracks, it shows growth and accumulation of DCR even in the face of the dropping exchange rate. This fact,  coupled with the fact that the proposal seeks to use the budget as the maximum cap for all translation-related operations and not earmarking all of it for spending, makes me confident that provided it is trimmed appropriately after receiving sufficient feedback from stakeholders it will be a decent addition to all current marketing and outreach initiatives, even after factoring in the fact that it is simply making a piece of on-going Decred operations  more transparent by bringing it to Politeia and explicitly asking for the approval of its budget and scope by the community.\n\n\u003e I also oppose the proposal and management fee. I have never seen this in other proposals and believe this kind of stuff should be labour of love and strictly unbillable.\n\nAgain, I disagree, but maybe I need to explain what I mean by this more clearly, but TL;DR, **this is not the cost of writing up the proposal**.\nHaving never managed a proposal that involves other contributors (or any proposal whatsoever, to be clear) billing against it I've requested additional funds to cover for work spent reviewing invoices made against it, making sure that expenses stay reasonable, deliverables are catalogued appropriately, and everything runs smoothly enough to avoid going over the prop budget.\nThere is work underway to implement proposal billing caps in CMS, I believe, but in case it turns out insufficient enough to do what I'd ideally want it to, and there is some need for manual review, I reckon 2 hours worth of work per month (tops) is a small price to pay for the value added.\nAs for your second point, degeri's approved [Decred Bug Bounty Program: Phase 3](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2170df6) cointains the following billing item:\n\u003e Any other non-bounty expenditure like emailing, bookkeeping, writeups, etc.\n\n, which I see as a similar cost of operation, hence the reason for its inclusion.\nI hope this clears up any and all misunderstandings.\n\nAs for the point about translation automation I agree, *it would be lovely* if a system like that existed, but unless you can point us to it or submit a counterproposal in this area yourself this is not the approach that we are putting forward here.\nHowever, to expand on your point, which I think is very valid here, I don't know about other contributors, but personally I make use of CAT (computer-assisted translation) to cut down on work time and therefore reduce the cost extensively, and all my translation billings reflect the time it took to complete them **with** the use of CAT already.\nAs you say, machine translation is good enough to get the main gist across, a point which I believe I've already addressed in a different reply to a comment, but unreviewed, uncorrected for incorrect word choice, sentence syntax, stylistic devices, grammar, etc., and unpolished has no place in a project as professional as Decred.\nThink of this, would you rather have a non-English crypto enthusiast or investor read a translation of one of your research papers translated by someone who knows the subject matter to try and do it justice, or one that was chucked into a machine which mistranslated highly-specific terms or messes up the syntax or context?\nIf our project-related output is forever, especially on the Internet, which goes double for the resources the Decred stakeholders are already paying for though proposal funding, I reckon they deserve to be done right.","signature":"8a8791a7cc054981fa2e3c93cd7ac9de36138decd587b212383e1a71f283d21352918ef65b86008ac357ce3c0e1b37640e94ab9a1cf839bdcb78e6f24240450a","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"12","receipt":"c394b54acaa42f3f21719a4972882e5400f96cafa6b910aca1917aca826ea8d68b2ab71683bd6e9927bde38c62f2c31960cbfcb10ada0a65fead4cdbae128204","timestamp":1602840188,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

First, I would like to introduce myself:  I started working on Decred almost a year ago now with DCR Comic, a project we worked with Pablito not long ago. Currently, I am collaborating with different designs for the LATAM Marketing team, and I also collaborated in the UI of dcronchain.com.\n\nI want to cover my experience about working on translations.\n\nBefore collaborating on YouTube content for Decred en Español, I came out with the idea of subtitling Exitus’ videos. I had honestly never done any translation work on video, so I completely ignored how long it actually takes: out of a 10 minutes video, it took me about 6 to 8 hours to finish.\n\nThe main reason is that in addition to the work of timing each phrase, it was the way to translate certain words, and I can only imagine that it may be similar in other languages:\n\nWhen talking about 'Proof of Stake', in Spanish, the literal translation would be: 'Prueba de Estaca', where 'Stake' refers to the weapon 'stake', and not to the 'risk of betting on' as it really means in this case in particular.\n\nAnd this is just an example, there are many other different cases that depends a lot on the context. This is the main reason why the translation quality is better than the literal translation performed by platforms like YouTube (at least in spanish)\n\nHowever, IMHO I do not consider the translation work to be charged at the same rate as a designer or a developer. I think the job should be charged between 15/h to 20/h.\n\nFrom my experience of doing 3 translations in 3 different videos, although translating video takes clearly more time than translating an article, I think we could at least review the hourly payment in this case.","signature":"e7ab1380236529ea24958f2533a0bf2aa3b7770a614024392c2422e1b83d0cdc5344fc5fe20493c09f39485950c5ea7b195d8d60892a108e983d798d28071609","publickey":"5bc8f85fce716ed3474cb934bab485de68c8766ec7c2bbe386955e4542ca5765","commentid":"13","receipt":"2199d97ceb89ea7f2d7a3c0cde843f4f352de785973f714eac27ff2feac0e2d480fc45373dc4e8ddeccd2b77e39aef810caa1ac2992343155bb418c2d00c8c09","timestamp":1602857426,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Formalization of a translation budget seems like a good step forward.\n- Kozel and Bee have done an good job digging into current translation efforts, asking for feedback and documenting translations. While costly, I think this proposal covers much of the translation efforts and includes everything we should take into account to localize the project.\n\nThe worries:\n- What to translate: Past discussions have pointed out that atemporal and user focused (not dev/tech focused) content should be translated. Example: While it might be an interesting read, I feel like most people in LATAM don't care about what the Federal Reserve is doing so that article isn't worth it.\n-Translation vs. Localization: I'm worried that most translations are not having the impact they should because they are just translations. It would be better to localize content and fund content creation that better targets regional audience.\n- Video subbing cost is not worth it. I believe subbing impact and the same amount could be used to fund simple remakes of those videos, spoken in other languages, not just with subs. Regional marketing teams could use those funds to develop their own content, fitting their own needs.\n-Quality: The main issue with paying for translations has always been quality. I would only vote for a translation proposal that includes some kind of peer review and splits the budget between the reviewer and the \"main translator\". While I think $30/h is quite high (mainly because most marketing contractors who know the project can do the job), splitting it 20-10 for translation and review might yield good results and would vote for this kind of budget if it includes reviews.\n-Platforms and tools: I see this proposal does not include any kind of plan to coordinate software localization which I think is a priority to onboard new users and also (sort of) helps develop a knowledge base with vocabulary specific to the project.\n\nErrors:\n- LATAM proposal is not funding the Decred Journal translation. Both proposals include it and it is currently being billed against the US Marketing \u0026 Project Release Coordination 2020 proposal.","signature":"c48d643784b5c3645afce7965e7d7d9b44978c22829da30174c51e22eda2849e87d6cd304f7fc2e5bdc5d17ab4b515bc89605b7a814355a44cdfa86d8dc4030e","publickey":"921b6fbcf54d69288802373a6060df03efdaa60ef3843f8e102b68146b2cc96f","commentid":"14","receipt":"fdf466b5511a0ad7304bdb45cb387b7c4ebe720c9d5c3271ec144fee92775de5e6f30482d42375eda99c3b704f37a7f70108d4f201f7c91d6024b9ec5aaa110b","timestamp":1602876449,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I have never seen this in other proposals and believe this kind of stuff should be labour of love and strictly unbillable.\n\nGood point to discuss.\n\nProposal owner needs to coordinate team members and report to stakeholders on progress and expenses (we rarely do this but we really should). The more people you have in the proposal, the more time it takes to manage them. Getting a multi-person proposal submitted is quite an achievement. Executing it is another achievement. Mind that once the proposal is finished and the plan/processes are established, the management overhead drops.\n\nThere is a reason why project managers get paid at all, and often _more_ than their subordinates. We need more strong leaders who can work for us. Thinking of \"company\" image, I would like them to know they can get paid here. The choice \"should I start a new team and manage it for free or just do some paid hours in existing proposals?\" is a dis-incentive to create new budgets and new \"jobs\" in Decred.\n\nI appreciate if some contributors can afford to do it for free, but I do not oppose paying those who cannot. You are familiar with the challenge of low % of Decred time that gets billed :) Formalizing every extra bit helps, esp. if you depend on it for living.\n\nThere is a problem of excessive drain by management overhead in conventional orgs that we must prevent and we are adding measures for that. It is already possible for same-domain contractors to verify that proposal owner is not putting crazy hours for management, this is already extremely uncommon.\n\nFor me it is simply a question of cost and outputs.","signature":"4e2b4baea5b436523b140115447bcb590169ffcadf97e9b85aed850ca603ba14267913de8bf23a09e32765a0119b29897943891989e076c38531ad2eac6adc0a","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"17","receipt":"875e9c47d2643ea016fad3a4e92d886b2e27a95e0417c46d537ec65b4b59ab72592a874210631989ad1f798d64a73375df30c1986903aff3d254a49e0a5d0502","timestamp":1603753703,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The key here is finding outlets which don't insist on a pay-to-play approach to publishing. The more people hear about and recognise Decred, the more open crypto outlets will be to publish our content to attract more traffic their way making such a deal mutually beneficial.\n\n\u003e * I see an overlap with second Latam proposal for funding Spanish content. How does this work, which one will pay?

Does this new proposal effectively replace (take over) that part of the US proposal? These overlaps are confusing, it would help a lot to clarify that.\n\nI can see why this is confusing\nI was operating under the assumption that the LATAM phase 2 proposal handles the translation of the Decred Journal into Spanish, as the proposal states in its deliverables (and as I outlined in an earlier stage of the proposal). This was challenged on two occasions (once in the [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c093b8a808ef68665709995a5a741bd02502b9c6c48a99a4b179fef742ca6b2a/comments/14)) by pablito, and once in a private DM. The whole thing grows more difficult to decipher when you take into account [dustorf's reply to a similar question](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af/comments/3) on the 2020 US Marketing and Release Coordination Budget, which states that the budget for the Decred Journal is inclusive of all translations.\nHowever, earlier this year we were encouraged to put together a proposal that would serve as a budget for all translation initiatives (the DJ included), as putting all these efforts under one roof, so to speak, makes a lot of sense. \n\nIt is for this reason that I believe that should this proposal pass, all Decred Journal translation expenses will be billed against **this** proposal (effectively replacing the 2020 US Marketing budget item for translation only expenses, which would still serve as a budget to *create* the DJ in the first place, in English), hopefully leaving more fuel in the tank in the budget of other props, and therefore the Treasury.\n\n\u003e * What type of video translation is funded here, a full voice over or text subtitles? Looking at the hours at first I figured it is the full voice over, but reading nachito's comment I'm not so sure.\n\nThis is another thing I would like to see a more formal approach making use of the \"best bang for the buck\" applied to. While I can definitely recognise the appeal of voicing over/subbing Decred content it is simply inefficient from a financial perspective. First, if there is no script, which for, let's say (most of) the Decred Assembly, or Deep Dive, or Decred in Depth there aren't, one would need to be created, and I know this in itself could be laughably expensive. Then there's the translation itself, and then the potential editing with synchronising timing, etc. In my opinion, while potentially attractive, this is not the best, so it's not something I would authorise as a prop owner (**note:** I hesitate to even use that term, because I would like the translation workgroup to make decisions collectively, but it needs to be put this way since there's probably going to be one person responsible for how everything turns out and I'm not one to rubberstamp inefficient spending).\n\nWhat I would suggest we do in the first place is try to find relevant, high-quality content we already have English scripts for, like Exitus' output, which is usually on-topic and concise, and go from there. I could also potentially see transcribing scripts for more relevant and technical videos, like some of this year's Consensus Distributed appearances and then subbing those in several languages if there's demans, but that's to be seen.\n\nKey takeaway when it comes to working with video material is this, **the less time it takes to get the material workable, the better**. It also goes without saying that amplifying the material the Decred community is already paying for would be of high importance, so there will be little love for rando \"here's 10 reasons why Decred will pump in 2021\" videos here.\n\nAlso, I want to note that just like with the rest of the proposed translation output, this is **strictly up to the translators' discretion.** Some people don't like working on videos, some dislike jargon-heavy texts, and there will be no forcing of anyone to do anything. However, if it is decided that something is worth translating and spreading further and someone is willing to do it, we'll have the means to do so.\n\n\u003e * Do you have a fallback person to manage the proposal, just in case?\n\nNot explicitly, no, but as we've already discussed in private, and I'm sure most people will be delighted to hear, @bee has kindly offered his help where possible, but under no circumstance is he to be held accountable as a vice proposal owner. In any case, I'm glad to have your support on this one :)\n\n\u003e * What do you think about the idea to pay for word counts instead of hours, as suggested on Reddit? Is it feasible?\n\nThis is how it works in the translation industry, so I see no reason why we shouldn't at least try to implement such an approach here, because a flat rate would reduce the variation in compensation per deliverable. However, some tweaking would be required for several reasons, which, off the top of my head would be:\n\n* payment for work is denominated in USD, but payable in DCR, so this would need to be reflected here as well (not xx DCR/word, as in the Reddit post)\n* traditional translation is, I believe, in **fiat/word** or **fiat/character** (usually an agreed rate per xx word/chars), depending on the region, because longer words == more characters and shorter words == more words == more complex syntax\n* how the text is structured needs to be taken into account, as you wouldn't just smack the raw Decred Journal into a word processor, count the words/chars and call it a day, because the text contains links and other elements of the format syntax that need to be preserved in the text but do not to be translated themselves, and the same goes for text structure in software files, etc., which makes estimating the size of the job trickier than it looks at first sight and requires some work in its own right \n\nNevertheless, this is something I would definitely love to work out in order to make the playing field equal for all potential contributors.","signature":"e9eada9dfe3f1109bed5dd4523fb08c065632afbf9e7c54e221fe623d7c2c51ab7019aaacc96ac112f37cc3fa0103098ed2eed68ffce45f7eb2a4230a2b68402","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"19","receipt":"b94407d736cea52efe36eb8d717a98de202921b188db3542a631fd9515f0baba33684b5ef929c27038ed84b0d7e932b5a4f433b862902bca5a3acee073401a03","timestamp":1603972932,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
