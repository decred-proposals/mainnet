Decred Content and Asset Translation Proposal

### What

This proposal is a long overdue attempt at formalising the stance of the Decred stakeholder community towards translation efforts of Decred-related (and produced) content and assets and providing funding for said efforts in order to bring more transparency and control to this particular this domain of the project. more formal, transparent, and controllable by the stakeholder community.

The issue of project-related content translation has always been a contentious one, with problems ranging from:
- who should be allowed to bill for work in this particular domain,
- what the contractor rate for work performed in this domain should be, if different from the standard contributor rate,
- which languages the community should look at to have the content translated into in order to provide the best return for the money reception and reach-wise,
- which pieces of Decred-related content would offer the best value for money if disseminated to a wider audience,
- whether to sponsor translation work at all, or if translation efforts should be performed on a strictly voluntary basis

Nevertheless, despite the issues outlined above, translation efforts performed according to some rules achieved by rough consensus and billed to the Treasury have continued. This proposal serves as an effort to try and firmly define the rules, scope, and budget for the efforts in question.

It has been agreed that the majority of crowd-sourced solutions for the translation of Decred assets attempted in the past was sub-par in terms of quality. Though the linguistic acumen might have been present, some individuals' lack of alignment with the project vision and work ethos combined with quick profit as the main motivator and difficulty in getting deliverables quality reviews made for overall rather disappointing results.

The interim solution from that point has been one in which contributors with foreign language knowledge, established in other domains, would be tasked with performing necessary translation work for the benefit of the project. Said contributors were also granted a degree of discretion in terms of translation contributions they could bill the project Treasury for, and this proposal is an attempt at formalising and bringing more transparency to this process.

## Why

It is our belief that apart from making Decred-related content and assets available to non-English speakers, thus extending the reach of the project vision and messaging, it is a key aspect of community building and strengthening, allowing cryptocurrency enthusiasts from around the world to take part in building project awareness and helping it spread its message. It is for this reason that we would like for work in this area to continue in some shape or form, because we believe that creating a collection of easily-accessible and reusable assets helps penetrate regional discussions on social media, build project recognition, helps showcase the Decred contributor model for non-development areas of contribution, and project a unified presence in international crypto media in terms of release news and coordination.

## How

The proposal seeks to establish a mostly discretionary budget for translation in a few recognised areas, such as:

- the Decred Journal (continuous)
- website translation (as required)
- software localisation (Decrediton, mobile wallets, etc., at the contributor's discretion)
- video assets translation (at the contributor's discretion)
- articles/content translation (at the contributor's discretion)

In order to give an idea of scale of these efforts currently being undertaken I have asked some contributors listed below to share some data on translation work performed for their respective languages **over the last 6 months or so**. I present this data broken up into categories listed above as averages per month, unless stated otherwise:

- the Decred Journal (average for Spanish, Polish, Chinese and Arabic) - ** ca. 9 hrs per issue** (~~NOTE: funding for Decred Journal translation for Spanish comes from the separate [LATAM activities proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/3c02b67), so the actual average without Spanish works out to **8,5 hrs per issue**~~)
- website translation (average for Arabic, Polish, and Chinese) - **7 hrs** (this is **not** an average per month, but for the most recent website copy update and redesign)
- articles/content translation (average for Arabic, Spanish, and Chinese) - **~3,5 hrs per month**
- video content translation (average for Spanish and Chinese) - **~16,5 hrs per month**
- software localisation (average for Polish and Chinese) - **6 hrs** (**not** an average per month, but a total)

Going with a rough cost for said activities over the past several months (6 month period) and using the standard contractor rate the rough average per month over said period of time comes out to **2235 USD** for the total of **around 13,410 USD**. Please note that had work in the above areas been done for all of the listed languages the end figures would be different, and likely not conform to the calculated averages. The averages served as a rough extrapolation point for how much it would cost to expand the initiative by a language based on existing data.

Moreover, the proposal would request that additional funds (as per the above average projection) be allocated to potentially expand the initiative and open it up to new languages and/or contributors during the time of the proposal being in effect with the approval for it in its current form. This is to allow greater flexibility should there be a demand to accommodate additional languages without having to wait until the current phase of the proposal expires.

Additionally, the proposal would serve to provide funding for translation-related efforts within the project by contributors with knowledge of other languages that do not wish to do translation work defined in the scope above on a regular basis, but rather when general project development requires it, e.g. periodic website copy updates.


## Who

For the last several months there have been several contractors who have been contributing translated content for Decred at, at least, a semi-regular basis. Those are:

- @kozel ([Polish](https://medium.com/@artikozel))
- @arij (Arabic)
- @francov_([Spanish](https://medium.com/@francovdcr)), @pablito, @nachito
- @Dominic (Chinese)
- @mm ([Portuguese](https://stakey.club/pt/translated/))

The track record for individual contributors and their translation efforts has been meticulously documented in the [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/).
Moreover, @bee has done  a stellar job expanding upon and tidying up the GitHub translations repo that I started a long time ago, in which new translation entries are catalogued; this is by far the most accurate and up-to-date index of our translation work on Decred to my knowledge, and it can be found **[here](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations/blob/master/index.md)**. Hats off to you, my friend.

The translation budget would go towards contractor hours for providing translation work in languages listed above and possibly expanding the list for other languages should the stakeholders be interested in growing this initiative.

## When

The proposal would cover translation efforts for a period of 6 months (to be submitted for renewal in May 2021), as well as covering for the work performed in September and October 2020. After the proposal expires, a report summarising the proposal spending will be produced so that the potential follow-up proposal to continue the programme can be supplied with more accurate spending projections.

## Budget

The proposed budget allocation for this proposal uses the standard contractor rate and based on the previously presented data looks as follows :

- the Decred Journal = 9h x $30 x 7 languages (Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish + expansion pool for 2 additional ones) = $11340 over 6 months
- website translation = 7h x $30 x 8 languages (currently 6, + expansion pool for 2 additional ones) = $1680 over 6 months
- articles/content translation = 3,5h x $30 x 7 languages (Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish + expansion pool for 2 additional ones) = $4410 over 6 months
- video content translation = 8h x $30 x 7 languages (Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish + expansion pool for 2 additional ones) = $10080 over 6 months
- software localisation = 6h x $30 x 7 languages (Arabic, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish + expansion pool for 2 additional ones) = $1260 over 6 months
- proposal management and billing review = 2h x $30 = $360 over 6 months


**Total budget:** a  sum of **33 000 USD** to account for work until May 2021 and payment in arrears for work performed in September and October 2020.
Even though it may strike you as quite a sum of money (I know it did me when I crunched these numbers), and it is, it is helpful to consider it in terms of **average** hours worked per contributor per month based on data from the past several months, which averages out to ca. **32,5h** or a little under **$1000** per month.
**It is very important to note** that I do not expect this to be the continued average work output per contributor in this domain, as the proposal discussion will surely be helpful in narrowing down the scope of the proposal in some areas and/or putting on spending caps. 
This is a **projection** of what the maximum budget would need to look like to account for work done in all the abovementioned areas if they were to continue to the scope extrapolated from past data given the number of existing contributors and the potential to expand. The **actual** spending would be much, much lower. Moreover, given the billing control developments that are underway on Politeia, once these controls have been implemented it will become easier to control spending per each aspect of the proposal and/or contributor, to make sure the burn rate does not go over our projections and that all work delivered is productive and not to burn through the budget. The **expansion pool** included in the proposal not only gives us enough flexibility to expand this initiative if necessary, but also provides a cushion against proposal overspending.



To reiterate, **the proposed budget is a maximum cap on all project-related translation efforts, with any and all funds not spent by the end of the proposal's duration to remain in the project Treasury.**


I thank you very much for your time and attention and look forward to a fruitful discussion. 
All constructive feedback is very welcome and appreciated. 
Apologies for this having taken so long.

**EDIT 1** (16.10.2020):  I have included the decredcommunity GitHub** [translation index](https://github.com/decredcommunity/translations/blob/master/index.md)**. Thanks to @bee for this suggestion and the tonne of work he'd put into it.

**EDIT 2** (25.10.2020): I have updated the budget projections for the Decred Journal to account for its translation into Spanish and reduced the projections for video content translations **by half** to finally make the proposal vote-ready.
