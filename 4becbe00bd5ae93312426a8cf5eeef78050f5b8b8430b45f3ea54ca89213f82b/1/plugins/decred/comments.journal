To help those of us who actively vote and do not have a background in MMs I wonder if you would be willing to help explain a couple of things:\n\n1. What would this mean precisely for those trying to enter and exit Decred positions of greater than $1M USD?  I sometimes hear from the community \"I can't even open or close a position of $_ million USD in Decred, so I've reduced my planned investment amount to $X.\" - would this proposal solve this?  If not, what would solve this?\n\n2. Last year this article was discussed a number of times by the community on Telegram when discussing the idea of reaching out to or proposing an MM: https://hackernoon.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-crypto-market-making-13a44bb2d207 - one of the things that often came up is transparency.  Can you comment on what kind of reporting of what you are doing for Decred Project would be available to the stakeholder community?\n\n3. Can you share anything about previous clients, current clients, and/or references to help confidence in the wider stakeholder community?","signature":"8f9559bb454ac2d619575ad1290a46cf610e986d7ae0f36c1464d8e210233b52817d2e1ec2327cb30ec4640b2e1ad67171b222aec0b58dfc45a7005637a42202","publickey":"c754b6f41f964520fc29b01d68852b251f7d761f8dd9ac44887caba039b7cfff","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece79cee11ba35672aa4f04b8d0fec41f098e5717f8f2ab4c0b06a0d33c96600a10f59c18a21da592a03ce992b16dd3a10bb7f63b02afd6c95058f6c4903e0c","timestamp":1565211465,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This could be $27 / $33 (same as i2), $30 / $36 or, $24 / $30.\n\nWe specifically chose to word our offering this way because this gives us the flexibility to adjust our pricing relative to mid based on our inventory while still maintaining the same spread.

While none of the current proposals would allow someone to enter/exit positions of greater than $1M USD in one click, it would still greatly help the situation. Generally when large players want to put on a position, they use advanced execution algorithms. Even in the most liquid of assets (think Apple stock), positions are not generally entered/exited in one fell swoop. The most basic of these are TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume weighted average price). Most hedge funds have a team of PhDs working solely on reducing slippage. By increasing the liquidity available, these algorithms will be able to perform significantly better to reduce slippage form a target price which could be nough to sway a potential investor.\n\n2.) I'm glad that you brought this up. One of the first things we made clear to the team was that we would not be able to guarantee any volume numbers unlike some of our Asian counterparts. We are based in the US and are a wholly owned subsidiary of a traditional finance firm. As such, we do not engage in wash trading or any activities that are frowned upon by the CFTC. We will only guarantee width/size/uptime. We're very experienced in market making in traditional markets which are generally much more difficult due to the increased efficiency of those markets. I'll elaborate more in the next point.\n\n3.) Our firm is fairly young (1 yr old), so we've only done a this a few times under the Grapefruit name. We currently are market making for a few exchanges. We've previously supported the exchange launch of a new project as well. That said, in our previous stops, we've made markets across some of the most well known exchanges in crypto and traditional finance. Our founder (Mike Komaransky) was the founder of Cumberland and was one of the first market makers on BitMex and a handful of other exchanges before they were the household names that they are today. In former roles, we've also participated in structured market making programs in Euribor Swapnote Futures and Sugar futures on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (now part of ICE - owners of Bakkt) and Eurodollar Packs and Bundles on the CME. We've also provided liquidity in numerous Fixed Income and Equity derivatives markets in an unstructured manner during our high frequency trading roles.","signature":"f351ef869a2b9ca183b4adfab7c20a8da77bf8b235190ba9541926870470e1642c5bcae4950790de94320085f724b7c1bbc2b17b074d35df95b724cbca7eb101","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"6","receipt":"bed5fa5230947cdb814f8ed2e440e7e2387fdeb2fcdd98262c0b18c30ebf9d6f7e24d8a42bd878f868e86e45f0a4c2860e94a9a5747db6cc258a1af73d66f10c","timestamp":1565271978,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

However, I would not say that it's faking liquidity. Almost all exchanges have stipend or equity incentive market making programs when they launch new products.

Not all of them are success stories, but I think the fact that you continue to see these programs being introduced by exchanges in crypto and traditional finance shows that some analysis has been done and it's been shown to be beneficial.","signature":"0e23388b263a2e74f60836b41cc9dffdbbf505177f89a7f43ccde95d6b27ce6129a473437194cff17b06d1b1063b5ffe419058959d3a735c6546ea9fa89a4209","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"9","receipt":"5211b1269873fd743603436b1528e078d337f8d28045000466cae41aecb367c71bf9ee3a9df391f78b5094c610b46b1040c4b2ee5b2be38f5ee3ba2a2decbc0b","timestamp":1565272692,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I appreciate that you have stated in another [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/13) that you would pay for trading fees and these would not be charged to the Treasury. Is there a down side to this? Would you be taking any action to limit trading fees? Is the 80% uptime quoted relevant here?\n1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.\n1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. \n1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org\u0026via=matrix.org\u0026via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?\n1. What happens if you don't hit the targets for uptime or depth?\n1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $30k/month  seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.\n1. Is the DCR loan referenced the only loan you would require?\n1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms. As jz has also suggested, I would prefer that the lending costs be incorporated within this proposal. I appreciate that you have proposed an interest rate for the lender and provided some calculations, but it would make things easier if each proposal represents a complete package.","signature":"ce4051454893cb27e306620d27135895d8cf53fac30d8629d99dceaedb7ef1a6af2937cf304dbd381741d3a3178b9d4b5c902ea93de1bf74f0935b34fb7aaa09","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"19","receipt":"6fb7d1c7fa8307827914396fc05d12b1b310aa7a2cd0a5993da45939137cc2a5ed33b656405fd327462c7a0f5224e4bc48da6c6849a5cc312f7c248e59fc100e","timestamp":1565297019,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
