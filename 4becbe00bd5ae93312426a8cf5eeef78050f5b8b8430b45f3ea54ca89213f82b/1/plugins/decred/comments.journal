To help those of us who actively vote and do not have a background in MMs I wonder if you would be willing to help explain a couple of things:\n\n1. What would this mean precisely for those trying to enter and exit Decred positions of greater than $1M USD?  I sometimes hear from the community \"I can't even open or close a position of $_ million USD in Decred, so I've reduced my planned investment amount to $X.\" - would this proposal solve this?  If not, what would solve this?\n\n2. Last year this article was discussed a number of times by the community on Telegram when discussing the idea of reaching out to or proposing an MM: https://hackernoon.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-crypto-market-making-13a44bb2d207 - one of the things that often came up is transparency.  Can you comment on what kind of reporting of what you are doing for Decred Project would be available to the stakeholder community?\n\n3. Can you share anything about previous clients, current clients, and/or references to help confidence in the wider stakeholder community?","signature":"8f9559bb454ac2d619575ad1290a46cf610e986d7ae0f36c1464d8e210233b52817d2e1ec2327cb30ec4640b2e1ad67171b222aec0b58dfc45a7005637a42202","publickey":"c754b6f41f964520fc29b01d68852b251f7d761f8dd9ac44887caba039b7cfff","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece79cee11ba35672aa4f04b8d0fec41f098e5717f8f2ab4c0b06a0d33c96600a10f59c18a21da592a03ce992b16dd3a10bb7f63b02afd6c95058f6c4903e0c","timestamp":1565211465,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
