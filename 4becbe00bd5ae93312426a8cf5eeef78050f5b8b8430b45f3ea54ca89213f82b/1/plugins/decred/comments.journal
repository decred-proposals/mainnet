To help those of us who actively vote and do not have a background in MMs I wonder if you would be willing to help explain a couple of things:\n\n1. What would this mean precisely for those trying to enter and exit Decred positions of greater than $1M USD?  I sometimes hear from the community \"I can't even open or close a position of $_ million USD in Decred, so I've reduced my planned investment amount to $X.\" - would this proposal solve this?  If not, what would solve this?\n\n2. Last year this article was discussed a number of times by the community on Telegram when discussing the idea of reaching out to or proposing an MM: https://hackernoon.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-crypto-market-making-13a44bb2d207 - one of the things that often came up is transparency.  Can you comment on what kind of reporting of what you are doing for Decred Project would be available to the stakeholder community?\n\n3. Can you share anything about previous clients, current clients, and/or references to help confidence in the wider stakeholder community?","signature":"8f9559bb454ac2d619575ad1290a46cf610e986d7ae0f36c1464d8e210233b52817d2e1ec2327cb30ec4640b2e1ad67171b222aec0b58dfc45a7005637a42202","publickey":"c754b6f41f964520fc29b01d68852b251f7d761f8dd9ac44887caba039b7cfff","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece79cee11ba35672aa4f04b8d0fec41f098e5717f8f2ab4c0b06a0d33c96600a10f59c18a21da592a03ce992b16dd3a10bb7f63b02afd6c95058f6c4903e0c","timestamp":1565211465,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This could be $27 / $33 (same as i2), $30 / $36 or, $24 / $30.\n\nWe specifically chose to word our offering this way because this gives us the flexibility to adjust our pricing relative to mid based on our inventory while still maintaining the same spread.

While none of the current proposals would allow someone to enter/exit positions of greater than $1M USD in one click, it would still greatly help the situation. Generally when large players want to put on a position, they use advanced execution algorithms. Even in the most liquid of assets (think Apple stock), positions are not generally entered/exited in one fell swoop. The most basic of these are TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume weighted average price). Most hedge funds have a team of PhDs working solely on reducing slippage. By increasing the liquidity available, these algorithms will be able to perform significantly better to reduce slippage form a target price which could be nough to sway a potential investor.\n\n2.) I'm glad that you brought this up. One of the first things we made clear to the team was that we would not be able to guarantee any volume numbers unlike some of our Asian counterparts. We are based in the US and are a wholly owned subsidiary of a traditional finance firm. As such, we do not engage in wash trading or any activities that are frowned upon by the CFTC. We will only guarantee width/size/uptime. We're very experienced in market making in traditional markets which are generally much more difficult due to the increased efficiency of those markets. I'll elaborate more in the next point.\n\n3.) Our firm is fairly young (1 yr old), so we've only done a this a few times under the Grapefruit name. We currently are market making for a few exchanges. We've previously supported the exchange launch of a new project as well. That said, in our previous stops, we've made markets across some of the most well known exchanges in crypto and traditional finance. Our founder (Mike Komaransky) was the founder of Cumberland and was one of the first market makers on BitMex and a handful of other exchanges before they were the household names that they are today. In former roles, we've also participated in structured market making programs in Euribor Swapnote Futures and Sugar futures on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (now part of ICE - owners of Bakkt) and Eurodollar Packs and Bundles on the CME. We've also provided liquidity in numerous Fixed Income and Equity derivatives markets in an unstructured manner during our high frequency trading roles.","signature":"f351ef869a2b9ca183b4adfab7c20a8da77bf8b235190ba9541926870470e1642c5bcae4950790de94320085f724b7c1bbc2b17b074d35df95b724cbca7eb101","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"6","receipt":"bed5fa5230947cdb814f8ed2e440e7e2387fdeb2fcdd98262c0b18c30ebf9d6f7e24d8a42bd878f868e86e45f0a4c2860e94a9a5747db6cc258a1af73d66f10c","timestamp":1565271978,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

One potential problem might arise if the lender wants the interest to be paid in DCR. It will be difficult for us to set a fixed dollar amount if we have liabilities in DCR. Is it possible to have the stipend be some fixed dollar amount (payable in DCR form) and some fixed DCR amount for the interest?","signature":"b15252ac96a64b548c61cea23c1f6b8ad43b3f31fec5ba2f9167072461092107eef0550724a47a5f86eb0430d74d15407c7d2e663156aa030edfb225bb26210f","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"7","receipt":"2324343690fd3c6ad883cea1408478ef82a7ec1285fa357d89958dbd7ac717c1bc11040b5280c0ab6b5bd59053a9f27c257c5a4fedf3678b45a3ef8105167107","timestamp":1565272320,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

However, I would not say that it's faking liquidity. Almost all exchanges have stipend or equity incentive market making programs when they launch new products. You can see some examples in my other answer. Not all of them are success stories, but I think the fact that you continue to see these programs being introduced by exchanges in crypto and traditional finance shows that some analysis has been done and it's been shown to be beneficial.","signature":"0e23388b263a2e74f60836b41cc9dffdbbf505177f89a7f43ccde95d6b27ce6129a473437194cff17b06d1b1063b5ffe419058959d3a735c6546ea9fa89a4209","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"9","receipt":"5211b1269873fd743603436b1528e078d337f8d28045000466cae41aecb367c71bf9ee3a9df391f78b5094c610b46b1040c4b2ee5b2be38f5ee3ba2a2decbc0b","timestamp":1565272692,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
