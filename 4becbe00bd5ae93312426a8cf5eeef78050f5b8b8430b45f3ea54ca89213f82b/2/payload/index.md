Grapefruit Trading Market Making proposal



# Grapefruit Trading Market Making Proposal for Decred #
 

In Q2 2019 we became aware of an opportunity to market make for Decred, which piqued our interest given the quality of the project.

Who are we? We’re Grapefruit Trading, a relatively young trading firm, though our collective experience in the traditional markets spans over 40 years, and our crypto markets experience spans over 25 years. We were founded by Mike Komaransky, one of the pioneers of Cumberland within DRW. Few people have longer institutional-scale experience in the crypto markets than Mike. 

The below proposal stems from early conversations with Max Bronstein, JZ and Chris Burniske. As a general starting principle, we should note that everything in this proposal is up for amendment. 

**General Statistics**

 * Binance DCR/BTC 24 hr volume: 29 BTC
 * Bittrex DCR/USDT 24 hr volume: 18K USDT
 * Bittrex DCR/BTC 24 hr volume: 10 BTC
 * OkCoin DCR/USD 24 hr volume: 0 USD

 

### Motivation & Benefits ###

The goal is to help grow the Decred community by improving the depth and pricing of the DCR markets. Adding liquidity to some of the DCR markets should reduce volatility, which will be helpful to DCR stakers and transactors, while also establishing deeper pools for DCR investors and traders to take positions in.  

### Implementation & Timeline ###

We expect two months or less for development once approved, with the monthly fee only starting upon launch. Grapefruit will show $30,000 equivalent per side, will be 4% wide [bid-to-ask](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp), and have a minimum of 80% uptime. 

The pairs we plan to provide liquidity for will be Binance DCR/BTC, Bittrex DCR/USDT, Bittrex DCR/BTC, OkCoin DCR/USD, though these pairs can be changed should the relevant Decred parties deem it in the network’s best interest (e.g., a new exchange listing). In case it’s not obvious, no additional funds can be allocated without a revision of the Pi proposal. We mention the possibility of changing the exchange pairs supported should it be in the network’s best interest, and as a sign of our commitment to Decred.

We’ve suggested these parameters as it corresponds to a pragmatic price per pair, but have provided one other option for the spread below. Note that each exchange pair has a cost.

### Project Cost ###

At 4% wide bid-to-ask, the monthly fee per market would be $7,000. 

As Grapefruit Trading plans to service a total of four markets, if a 4% spread is chosen then $28,000.00 will be owed to Grapefruit for each month of service. The term length is 6 months with an option to renew at the end of the term.

In an effort to align the interests of Grapefruit Trading and the Decred stakeholders, we’re happy to accept DCR as payment as long as the total value is pegged to USD. This way, we’re protected in the case DCR falls in price and the treasury is protected in the case DCR rises in price. At the beginning of each month, Grapefruit Trading will submit an invoice for our service. 
 

### Additional Details ###

DCR capital will be provided to Grapefruit Trading as a zero-interest loan in the amount of 3x the offer side quoting obligation (3 x $30,000 x 4 markets = $360,000 in DCR that needs to be provided, or 12,000 DCR @ $30 per DCR).

Alternity Capital has agreed to provide that capital, and in return for the opportunity cost of staking, we suggest that the treasury compensate them at a rate equivalent to staking DCR. Assuming the current annual return on staking is ~10%, that comes out to 0.80% per month on the loan. Such a rate off 12,000 DCR comes out to 96 DCR per month, or at current market prices, $2,880/month. To stay in line with staking returns, we recommend the 96 DCR/month compensation be held constant, and then the DCR amount can be adjusted at the end of this 6-month term.  

Grapefruit Trading has no liability on any amount of loaned DCR that is lost in the event that the above exchanges loses or absconds with them (hack, exit scam, etc).

Grapefruit Trading reserves the right to support a new exchange listing in lieu of any of the pairs listen in this proposal. This process will be informal, and we will rely on JZ, Chris, and Max to communicate any desired changes.
