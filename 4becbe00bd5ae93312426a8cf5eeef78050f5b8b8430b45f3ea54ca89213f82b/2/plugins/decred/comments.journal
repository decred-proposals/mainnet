To help those of us who actively vote and do not have a background in MMs I wonder if you would be willing to help explain a couple of things:\n\n1. What would this mean precisely for those trying to enter and exit Decred positions of greater than $1M USD?  I sometimes hear from the community \"I can't even open or close a position of $_ million USD in Decred, so I've reduced my planned investment amount to $X.\" - would this proposal solve this?  If not, what would solve this?\n\n2. Last year this article was discussed a number of times by the community on Telegram when discussing the idea of reaching out to or proposing an MM: https://hackernoon.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-crypto-market-making-13a44bb2d207 - one of the things that often came up is transparency.  Can you comment on what kind of reporting of what you are doing for Decred Project would be available to the stakeholder community?\n\n3. Can you share anything about previous clients, current clients, and/or references to help confidence in the wider stakeholder community?","signature":"8f9559bb454ac2d619575ad1290a46cf610e986d7ae0f36c1464d8e210233b52817d2e1ec2327cb30ec4640b2e1ad67171b222aec0b58dfc45a7005637a42202","publickey":"c754b6f41f964520fc29b01d68852b251f7d761f8dd9ac44887caba039b7cfff","commentid":"2","receipt":"7ece79cee11ba35672aa4f04b8d0fec41f098e5717f8f2ab4c0b06a0d33c96600a10f59c18a21da592a03ce992b16dd3a10bb7f63b02afd6c95058f6c4903e0c","timestamp":1565211465,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This could be $27 / $33 (same as i2), $30 / $36 or, $24 / $30.\n\nWe specifically chose to word our offering this way because this gives us the flexibility to adjust our pricing relative to mid based on our inventory while still maintaining the same spread.

While none of the current proposals would allow someone to enter/exit positions of greater than $1M USD in one click, it would still greatly help the situation. Generally when large players want to put on a position, they use advanced execution algorithms. Even in the most liquid of assets (think Apple stock), positions are not generally entered/exited in one fell swoop. The most basic of these are TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume weighted average price). Most hedge funds have a team of PhDs working solely on reducing slippage. By increasing the liquidity available, these algorithms will be able to perform significantly better to reduce slippage form a target price which could be nough to sway a potential investor.\n\n2.) I'm glad that you brought this up. One of the first things we made clear to the team was that we would not be able to guarantee any volume numbers unlike some of our Asian counterparts. We are based in the US and are a wholly owned subsidiary of a traditional finance firm. As such, we do not engage in wash trading or any activities that are frowned upon by the CFTC. We will only guarantee width/size/uptime. We're very experienced in market making in traditional markets which are generally much more difficult due to the increased efficiency of those markets. I'll elaborate more in the next point.\n\n3.) Our firm is fairly young (1 yr old), so we've only done a this a few times under the Grapefruit name. We currently are market making for a few exchanges. We've previously supported the exchange launch of a new project as well. That said, in our previous stops, we've made markets across some of the most well known exchanges in crypto and traditional finance. Our founder (Mike Komaransky) was the founder of Cumberland and was one of the first market makers on BitMex and a handful of other exchanges before they were the household names that they are today. In former roles, we've also participated in structured market making programs in Euribor Swapnote Futures and Sugar futures on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (now part of ICE - owners of Bakkt) and Eurodollar Packs and Bundles on the CME. We've also provided liquidity in numerous Fixed Income and Equity derivatives markets in an unstructured manner during our high frequency trading roles.","signature":"f351ef869a2b9ca183b4adfab7c20a8da77bf8b235190ba9541926870470e1642c5bcae4950790de94320085f724b7c1bbc2b17b074d35df95b724cbca7eb101","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"6","receipt":"bed5fa5230947cdb814f8ed2e440e7e2387fdeb2fcdd98262c0b18c30ebf9d6f7e24d8a42bd878f868e86e45f0a4c2860e94a9a5747db6cc258a1af73d66f10c","timestamp":1565271978,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

However, I would not say that it's faking liquidity. Almost all exchanges have stipend or equity incentive market making programs when they launch new products.

Not all of them are success stories, but I think the fact that you continue to see these programs being introduced by exchanges in crypto and traditional finance shows that some analysis has been done and it's been shown to be beneficial.","signature":"0e23388b263a2e74f60836b41cc9dffdbbf505177f89a7f43ccde95d6b27ce6129a473437194cff17b06d1b1063b5ffe419058959d3a735c6546ea9fa89a4209","publickey":"4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","commentid":"9","receipt":"5211b1269873fd743603436b1528e078d337f8d28045000466cae41aecb367c71bf9ee3a9df391f78b5094c610b46b1040c4b2ee5b2be38f5ee3ba2a2decbc0b","timestamp":1565272692,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I appreciate that you have stated in another [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/13) that you would pay for trading fees and these would not be charged to the Treasury. Is there a down side to this? Would you be taking any action to limit trading fees? Is the 80% uptime quoted relevant here?\n1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.\n1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. \n1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org\u0026via=matrix.org\u0026via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?\n1. What happens if you don't hit the targets for uptime or depth?\n1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $30k/month  seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.\n1. Is the DCR loan referenced the only loan you would require?\n1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms. As jz has also suggested, I would prefer that the lending costs be incorporated within this proposal. I appreciate that you have proposed an interest rate for the lender and provided some calculations, but it would make things easier if each proposal represents a complete package.","signature":"ce4051454893cb27e306620d27135895d8cf53fac30d8629d99dceaedb7ef1a6af2937cf304dbd381741d3a3178b9d4b5c902ea93de1bf74f0935b34fb7aaa09","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"19","receipt":"6fb7d1c7fa8307827914396fc05d12b1b310aa7a2cd0a5993da45939137cc2a5ed33b656405fd327462c7a0f5224e4bc48da6c6849a5cc312f7c248e59fc100e","timestamp":1565297019,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal are illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning.\n\nA) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250 FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process. Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and (3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4 FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:\n\n2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow. The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow. If Grapefruit provides such amazing service. Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.\n\n3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.\nFirst, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service. Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation. Once again if Grapefruit can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great. The community should know more about Grapefruit and their service. We look forward to seeing a list. Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free put / call to trade around? That is what that $30,000 a month is - it is a option for Grapefruit to trade around their own book. If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.\n\n4) A Potential Project Killer-\nAs someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say. The regulators know a few things really well. First, they know trading. Second, they understand markets and market mechanics. A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not. Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project. Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time. What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation. Say goodbye to the Treasury. Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left. The answer is no. Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.\n\nSecondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum\n\nI believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project. A killed project would not be a good SOV.","signature":"48090e1e33e621821981ba50955822c123ec176a1ace89b3874b772ad45978e3794fb7b6a267bb7efcaa563104e626b5b45f5882e1dca36b7e41379c902cc304","publickey":"528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","commentid":"20","receipt":"d910231e0351c35777c7a238f884b60fe6a38035991b3480fdaae430b23a813c6e8e6e373a48b8ee89cb83be4b9615ba5608e02e376ea91612a63925f6009b0b","timestamp":1565353734,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The quote from reddit is included below.\n\nI am concerned at the lack of the option to vote for none of the MMs. With the current voting choice, this option is not catered for and in effect, we are all assumed to want a MM, the question only being which of the three we want.\n\n\u003e  [Quote from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cm2uw1/decred_only_needs_one_market_maker/): \n\"It was suggested that we approve the proposal with the largest Yes - No vote tally, as it should be the choice most voters are content with. Should proposal A have 70% approval and proposal B have 65% approval, proposal A would be approved and proposal B would not. If everyone understands this, they are free to vote Yes on as many proposals as they are happy with (vote Yes on all if they want a MM and don't care which one it is). Politeia will be updated to allow multiple options, but until that time we'll have to build social consensus around the best way to handle these more complex votes.\"","signature":"9ff85470b18f91d7577126c58643cf4f9d863e9c102b8459d798d4df5b4169f09349b7d5a2b065a0165a6f10666413c5dd02d14eb5cc002794341616ad92aa03","publickey":"5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45","commentid":"22","receipt":"10d94306c22167f9593aed731c89ed0f119c09c6416d9186bb2f2a10a58ac6c04fe9aa5b605e99d9225d61a49ff7ded609709032f027b7b3835433eb9fb52000","timestamp":1565406976,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.\n\nNot counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.\n\nI do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.\n\n-Solar","signature":"79fc30124a60608fb8e211c1c0da88155b710f119ce639ccd01f75aa2ef2787b4bbc79a78822c50ad2af726e4ddce3c28de86344c004a4e4bc97356819851c0a","publickey":"561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327","commentid":"30","receipt":"18f47138cae0fd023bb607432ee26bff91b19036341b2fda21eb5878aac5735a5cc32e5250df4d796c18fb1c26e02e5b2fe245f1557ffbf4af62245c31faff0a","timestamp":1565490570,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If we have no net DCR position, we would likely make our market symmetric around what we deem to be the fair DCR value. If we are short DCR from other trading activity, perhaps we would adjust our quotes so that our bid is closer to spot than our offer, to encourage other market participants to sell us DCR.

Put in perspective, it is ~10% of monthly Treasury income and 15-20% of monthly spending (as of May-July 2019). It spends more than the team building our novel DEX (and skilled developers is the biggest bottleneck in the space!). I want to be absolutely sure this money is doing a lot of good work.\n\nGreat to see a second offer scaled down to $28K/month.\n\nBesides the spend I'm concerned if the market needs the proposed size of liquidity right now. If not, we will just burn money producing the service that is not fully consumed.\n\nIf liquidity is as big of a problem as we _assume_, then _any_ increase will be beneficial, i.e. even extra $10K on buy and sell sides will improve the situation.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What is the minimum total monthly budget you would be interested in?\n2. Can we start with that bare minimum and run it for e.g. 3 months, and scale up once the results prove that there _is_ a demand for that liquidity?","signature":"258b730db5cf6e04b6e607aaf324848f37ae70cc85bd26305d7df782130c0cc8cd4cfe086e033cc6b38e48c921650652e5e77df4c007ffda4ed422567cb46602","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"37","receipt":"476159ff851ed2ae188dcb63b31ac7a78ac266335a88acdd2986f44fc3d2c1c09dff5ebfa4f64c511a2c218febc1a57f3bc7bbd7b2cfa6abb313d99695a4440e","timestamp":1566556283,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There are many issues that I'd like to bring up, but will start with these two:\n\n1) **Legal/Compliance/Regulatory** It is my understanding that these are smaller trading firms without built-out, experienced Legal and Compliance teams -- legal and compliance teams with experience in both traditional and crypto landscapes. Please notice none of the larger trading firms in crypto have submitted proposals. The largest market-makers are: Jump Trading (Chicago), Cumberland Mining - DRW subsidiary (Chicago), Genesis Trading (NYC), BlueFire (Chicago), Susquehanna (Philly). Imho, would be a completely different story if one of these firms was proposing. _Generally, I'll ask, do we really need this? Is this essential to Decred Project right now? Is it worth a potential lawsuit if there is a falling out between the DCR community and one of these trading firms?_\n--\u003e **Can we do AMAs with the Legal and Compliance officers at these trading firms to discuss an regulatory/compliance/legal issues?** Would also be good to do AMA with founders like Mike Komaransky. I know Komo was instrumental to early days at Cumberland and has a good reputation, but would be easier to get direct clarity if founders are willing speak directly to DCR community -- that way the community can ask hard questions.\n\n2) **Market width is very wide and fee is very high** Fee doesn't make sense. There shouldn't be a fee. These firms have already written to all exchange APIs. _It'll take them 5minutes to start market-making with the DCR that we lend to them, and then they kick back and collect their fee monthly_. Imho, there should be no fee.\n--\u003e If the DCR community wants to do this.. Can we ease into it? In my experience, it never hurts to move slowly, step-by-step. **Can we do a 1-2 month trial period with a smaller amount of lended DCR to see the result?**","signature":"caa1a284bd65855e7d1efceed193b1cad7a09f15fdbfb38045ab3309ce2e69195bb6cad2044b969efa54a2072a7b524ea53e80fea6db87a773e1ae0d084cbd0c","publickey":"d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec","commentid":"38","receipt":"8c9b4ffdd3eb934d204dd3ba621ac5be95085b2c2cb6a8cdd6b55a9db916f968246c9ec06ac1cf55956a4ea25fae9ba2991a749486408ea9f6da0bfb23aa3c0b","timestamp":1566865490,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
