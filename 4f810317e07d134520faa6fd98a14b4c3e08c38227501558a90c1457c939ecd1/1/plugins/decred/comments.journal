Chainlink's community pumped out more memes than any other and they've managed to get into the top 10. Dogecoin, a literal meme coin, is valued at ~$400,000,000 with no active development. There are more examples, but you get the point.\n\nWith that said, I think paying people to make memes is a bad idea that would negatively affect organic community involvement. Anyone can open up Photoshop, MS Paint, Gimp etc and throw some text over a picture to create a meme. Looking at your portfolio, I'm not seeing anything special that would warrant ~$150 per meme. Take this one for instance: https://imgur.com/a/xh3uPMD and compare it to something more high-end like this from Chainlink: https://imgur.com/a/oISom6s\n\nOn top of that, we already have amazing designers from Eeter working as contractors. At the very least I would suggest for you to create some Decred memes voluntarily to show what you would potentially deliver, though I doubt the community would fund something like this given the recent uptick in Decred themed art showing up on twitter from long time Decred fans.","signature":"d67431188d1c2bee2ecdac5a4cc176d7f0e100d74a9b4ce7ab92a74533edece6fe11aeb835343e751a1ea96e89be6b70d7b170aecdf3d4c1a93469630d8cab01","publickey":"1d3a6202cf928d4c53ea9a4cc3df59f819d2ffc6a2d703bdd6ea001a7bc460f3","commentid":"3","receipt":"97818247ae13f10661cdc9708d62f95c4a0948b29b9d904c24ef5b4a44824d36d92d23346cffed24d8a3fa25e9129def82a50683d14f33dc4cb044817d33c50b","timestamp":1596218850,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm not a fan of the proposal in it's current format. I would prefer if there was some prior work you had applied specific to Decred as an example of what you would be delivering. It is typical for proposers to have built up a following with the community for a period of time to demonstrate their output and commitment to the project. We also don't pay out denominations in DCR, it is denominated in USD and this has an exchange rate each month.  I also believe 10DCR is also too expensive for what is being asked.\n\nMy core feedback, is I would like to see a bunch of these memes built, distributed and proven to the community that there is value here. This shows skin-in-the-game from your end and de-risks the venture for Decred stakeholders.","signature":"fd538cfab014bb7f416b2a30e52d146627c9f2b33c5088d43b00633635e5e5f099b7829e141f62e761ec8397b2271c1434c5bf2d220204ad91fc453f9e0a860e","publickey":"43de0dd848be1486598f24aeb226b1372feddf90e30ad493ed98c521ca0cf6b0","commentid":"4","receipt":"5a33bbd589946265af958dd9883ad53250faf99b67dc894b1f958ecf4fa1ac5142adfbb30e02926a48363c3abab636f304f2f5077832c0168ed2624d6e42ff03","timestamp":1596241373,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The take on memes in the proposal is somewhat superficial. Production of simple humorous puns in combination with some visuals is sort of a lower tier meme for a lack of better terminology. I'm on the opinion, these do not typically come across well when produced as a paid effort as well may create conflicts with the author, due to being highly subjective – but rather work when made out of love and interest.\n\nIn terms of memetics, as in really getting traction of an idea or some piece of information to a degree of it producing a noticeably viral spread, there’s unfortunately very few who pull off top tier memetic engineering at a consistent rate. The domain is highly experimental. I’m on the opinion that unless you’ve got a track record of producing stuff that’s gone properly viral in past, or is really appreciated by the community – I would not support funding it. \n\nOn paid memetics work, there's an older trend with ad/marketing agencies of trying to sell viral marketing campaigns to get a piece of that pie. Though the same issues applies – very few can  pull off something impactful. I recon this boils down to both factors of luck as mentioned, as well having the talent that's knowledgable and observant enough, combined with the thinking abilities to produce the potent enough thing that doesn't come off fake and whatnot. Noticeably the types who do that are rarely your average marketing or advertising people, but rather artists and eccentric types.\n\nIn DCR's past, I believe [jackliv3r](https://cryptograffiti.com/) has been the only contributor who's been funded (probably minimally?) for work that could count as memes, after he produced some quite catchy graphic pieces that at the time really caught on and received a lot of support, as well [cryptograffiti](https://cryptograffiti.com/) – though not sure if he was even funded?\n\nI could see funding memetics make sense if its someone/group with both a real track record of producing impactful and viral stuff (regardless of the format), with an in-depth understanding and alignment of the project fundamentals (and/or a large following or access to channels that also would support outcomes). Ie. https://brrr.money/ is a solid example as its picked up so widely.","signature":"b827341e8084a97228296649e98911665b4f3b66a87d358cb4c4cebe9bf6a45b9f6bc87ee2aa2dec42297e35df72bffb5356375bfa8fc385d3a0ee230ae3cb07","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"5","receipt":"9419767ee541a1ee70ee6786617e58eb206a79aec490610225428717acf3aa1540fad912a93bbca19094cceb4bfd0073d9e644ee7d8808ec027f0fd82400f20f","timestamp":1596289581,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
