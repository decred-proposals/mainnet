Other community members may not go to this length to check it out, so you could perhaps improve the accessibility of your portfolio by uploading some images to attach to your proposal.","signature":"e4e564cb3ea9b3c68f6f22341da875feb765ccfb2f01974686d07b88fb22caea2f94ce36d629ca4e33ea2313caf8ac5102c38a32c585aa8e39141164516e630a","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"e38bc5e10e05d086236e74469ce7c4534c4a606488388cdc356cb2dd8e538d30090a98137a1937b3c93caffaf51c4c7bf1939f817c84036481a77a31291dbc07","timestamp":1596195955,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
