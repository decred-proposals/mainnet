Chainlink's community pumped out more memes than any other and they've managed to get into the top 10. Dogecoin, a literal meme coin, is valued at ~$400,000,000 with no active development. There are more examples, but you get the point.\n\nWith that said, I think paying people to make memes is a bad idea that would negatively affect organic community involvement. Anyone can open up Photoshop, MS Paint, Gimp etc and throw some text over a picture to create a meme. Looking at your portfolio, I'm not seeing anything special that would warrant ~$150 per meme. Take this one for instance: https://imgur.com/a/xh3uPMD and compare it to something more high-end like this from Chainlink: https://imgur.com/a/oISom6s\n\nOn top of that, we already have amazing designers from Eeter working as contractors. At the very least I would suggest for you to create some Decred memes voluntarily to show what you would potentially deliver, though I doubt the community would fund something like this given the recent uptick in Decred themed art showing up on twitter from long time Decred fans.","signature":"d67431188d1c2bee2ecdac5a4cc176d7f0e100d74a9b4ce7ab92a74533edece6fe11aeb835343e751a1ea96e89be6b70d7b170aecdf3d4c1a93469630d8cab01","publickey":"1d3a6202cf928d4c53ea9a4cc3df59f819d2ffc6a2d703bdd6ea001a7bc460f3","commentid":"3","receipt":"97818247ae13f10661cdc9708d62f95c4a0948b29b9d904c24ef5b4a44824d36d92d23346cffed24d8a3fa25e9129def82a50683d14f33dc4cb044817d33c50b","timestamp":1596218850,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm not a fan of the proposal in it's current format. I would prefer if there was some prior work you had applied specific to Decred as an example of what you would be delivering. It is typical for proposers to have built up a following with the community for a period of time to demonstrate their output and commitment to the project. We also don't pay out denominations in DCR, it is denominated in USD and this has an exchange rate each month.  I also believe 10DCR is also too expensive for what is being asked.\n\nMy core feedback, is I would like to see a bunch of these memes built, distributed and proven to the community that there is value here. This shows skin-in-the-game from your end and de-risks the venture for Decred stakeholders.","signature":"fd538cfab014bb7f416b2a30e52d146627c9f2b33c5088d43b00633635e5e5f099b7829e141f62e761ec8397b2271c1434c5bf2d220204ad91fc453f9e0a860e","publickey":"43de0dd848be1486598f24aeb226b1372feddf90e30ad493ed98c521ca0cf6b0","commentid":"4","receipt":"5a33bbd589946265af958dd9883ad53250faf99b67dc894b1f958ecf4fa1ac5142adfbb30e02926a48363c3abab636f304f2f5077832c0168ed2624d6e42ff03","timestamp":1596241373,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The take on memes in the proposal is somewhat superficial. Production of simple humorous puns in combination with some visuals is sort of a lower tier meme for a lack of better terminology. I'm on the opinion, these do not typically come across well when produced as a paid effort as well may create conflicts with the author, due to being highly subjective – but rather work when made out of love and interest.\n\nIn terms of memetics, as in really getting traction of an idea or some piece of information to a degree of it producing a noticeably viral spread, there’s unfortunately very few who pull off top tier memetic engineering at a consistent rate. The domain is highly experimental. I’m on the opinion that unless you’ve got a track record of producing stuff that’s gone properly viral in past, or is really appreciated by the community – I would not support funding it. \n\nOn paid memetics work, there's an older trend with ad/marketing agencies of trying to sell viral marketing campaigns to get a piece of that pie. Though the same issues applies – very few can  pull off something impactful. I recon this boils down to both factors of luck as mentioned, as well having the talent that's knowledgable and observant enough, combined with the thinking abilities to produce the potent enough thing that doesn't come off fake and whatnot. Noticeably the types who do that are rarely your average marketing or advertising people, but rather artists and eccentric types.\n\nIn DCR's past, I believe [jackliv3r](https://cryptograffiti.com/) has been the only contributor who's been funded (probably minimally?) for work that could count as memes, after he produced some quite catchy graphic pieces that at the time really caught on and received a lot of support, as well [cryptograffiti](https://cryptograffiti.com/) – though not sure if he was even funded?\n\nI could see funding memetics make sense if its someone/group with both a real track record of producing impactful and viral stuff (regardless of the format), with an in-depth understanding and alignment of the project fundamentals (and/or a large following or access to channels that also would support outcomes). Ie. https://brrr.money/ is a solid example as its picked up so widely.","signature":"b827341e8084a97228296649e98911665b4f3b66a87d358cb4c4cebe9bf6a45b9f6bc87ee2aa2dec42297e35df72bffb5356375bfa8fc385d3a0ee230ae3cb07","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"5","receipt":"9419767ee541a1ee70ee6786617e58eb206a79aec490610225428717acf3aa1540fad912a93bbca19094cceb4bfd0073d9e644ee7d8808ec027f0fd82400f20f","timestamp":1596289581,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Anyone can open up Photoshop, MS Paint, Gimp etc and throw some text over a picture to create a meme. Looking at your portfolio, I'm not seeing anything special that would warrant ~$150 per meme. Take this one for instance: https://imgur.com/a/xh3uPMD and compare it to something more high-end like this from Chainlink: https://imgur.com/a/oISom6s*\n\nThank you for sharing your opinions on our proposal.  Here are some facts and our opinions on the matter:\n\n1. Fact: Decred is direct competitor of Bitcoin.\n2. Fact: Decred has many technical advantages compared to Bitcoin.\n3. Fact: Decred's advantages over Bitcoin are not visible on the Internet and the word of mouth for Decred (Galaxy Score of 61 on LunarCrush) is certainly worse than that for Bitcoin (Galaxy Score of 75 on LunarCrush)\n4. Fact: There are tens of thousands of memes on Bitcoin (https://tinyurl.com/bitcoinmemesongoogle) compared to just a few memes for Decred (https://preview.tinyurl.com/decredmemesongoogle)\n5. Fact: Most of the memes on Decred are of very poor visual quality and some are even negative (https://preview.tinyurl.com/negativememeaboutdecred)\n6. Fact: The Decred community has obviously not come up with high quality memes that are indexed by Google, until now.\n7. Fact: Decred is continuously losing value against Bitcoin. Please click \"ALL\" under https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DCRBTC/?exchange=BINANCE \n8. Fact: Marketing with memes would definitely not be harmful to Decred project.\n9. Fact: When a person is voting for this project, a question that can be asked is this: For a 300 million USD project (Decred), is 3000 USD marketing budget too much, or in other words is the contribution of this proposal going to be less than what it asks for. \n10. Opinion: The existing Memes on the Internet are not even comparable quality wise to do memes that our team has designed.\n11. Opinion: We challenge any community member to come up with an alternative graphic design provider, person or company, with each image costing $15 and images having such high quality.\n12. Opinion: We believe that it is much better to have standard super high quality memes that can be systematically used by community members, rather than expecting to come up with Memes on their own (which so far did not seem to happen). \n13. Opinion: The next bull market for cryptocurrencies is already here and this is Decred’s last chance to break years of silence and stalled price. An investment in super high quality memes, accompanies with a dedicated “army” of volunteers to spread these memes, can make a big difference for the future of the community and the project.\n\n*On top of that, we already have amazing designers from Eeter working as contractors. At the very least I would suggest for you to create some Decred memes voluntarily to show what you would potentially deliver, though I doubt the community would fund something like this given the recent uptick in Decred themed art showing up on twitter from long time Decred fans.*\n\n- Our previous work and the proposal \u0026 our replies are clear proof of our professionalism and quality of work. \n- We are not planning on creating \"voluntary\" memes for Decred. Everyone in crypto world wants to earn money, and nobody can be asked to work for free. \n- Our proposal is not a proposal to work for free, but to offer our high quality services to this community for a super low price.\n- We believe this is a biased comment, and we even suspect a conflict of interest, given that Eeter is mentioned but the relation of exitus to Eeter is not mentioned.\n- exitus is mentioining $150 per design ($15 per image, $30/hour as too much.  Given that you have mentioned Eeter working as contractor, could you also please share their cost per hour? \n- Please also can you share the free work that Eeter has provided in the recent past? So that we know if providing free work is a standard expectation in the Decred community or is it an expectation of exitus.\n- Given the costs, the community can make decision for their own whether $150 is too much for the high quality memes we are proposing.","signature":"f078585d259519f6c4cfc7b91fa9bb2835f28dcfeab411d7b89a46678debbfcb705576364f903937100a75838abfa710ebe3f18dc0df1ead68e2b43446983f09","publickey":"7e387b3ad0628756f22cb380e37acb9b76bca50b300bb297493a50afb728dfc4","commentid":"9","receipt":"be78529bce8566643ce29770ca04f4360c69a71ce2499a446c4cbff8765247c8407ae6abcdefb58c91a4cb76d7cf433d8ec56340cf6dee30288e4a2009f6ab00","timestamp":1596531624,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We also thank community members for voicing their thoughts and even concerns.\n\nAs an overall response to the comments, we kindly ask community members to consider the following facts, and answer for the future of the project the question we pose:\n\n- **Fact 1:** Decred is direct competitor of Bitcoin.\n- **Fact 2: **Decred has many technical advantages compared to Bitcoin. But Bitcoin has much wider recognition and market share.\n- **Fact 3:** Decred's advantages over Bitcoin are not visible on the Internet and the word of mouth for Decred (Galaxy Score of 61 on LunarCrush) is certainly worse than that for Bitcoin (Galaxy Score of 75 on LunarCrush)\n- **Fact 4:** There are tens of thousands of memes on Bitcoin (https://tinyurl.com/bitcoinmemesongoogle) compared to just a few memes for Decred (https://preview.tinyurl.com/decredmemesongoogle)\n- **Fact 5:** Most of the memes on Decred are of very poor visual quality and some are even negative (https://preview.tinyurl.com/negativememeaboutdecred)\n- **Fact 6: **The Decred community has obviously not come up with high quality memes that are indexed by Google, until now.\n- **Fact 7: **Decred is continuously losing value against Bitcoin. Please click \"ALL\" under https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DCRBTC/?exchange=BINANCE\n- **Fact 8: **Decred, *if the current rate of value loss continues*, is under the risk of becoming a \"dead coin\", which would cause all the investment of community members (including ours) to go to zero. \n- **Fact 9:** Marketing with memes would definitely *not* be harmful to Decred project. It *may* add value if the created high quality memes are virally shared by the community at large.\n- **Fact 10:** The financial aspects of the proposal can be assessed not only through opinions or perceptions, but also in comparison to rates for similar services and the value to be added in comparison to the cost.\n- **Question:** Given the current continuing declining situation of Decred against Bitcoin, which is better? \n\n- To **support** a proposal which aims to initiate a change at a minimal cost, and use their high quality memes as a stepping stone for extensive Internet marketing by community? \n- Or to **block** the low-cost proposal, forwarding the proposing team to other crypto communities, then wait for Decred community to create high quality memes on their own (which did not happen until now), and in the meantime watch **Decred losing more value and risking deeper to becoming a \"dead coin\"** (http://deadcoins.com), while **200 Decred out of 21,000,000 DCR are preserved**.","signature":"40ac7fe6e71cc058fde327301fa4223dcd10278c27f21968768c2d687bcd9ef7a84751ab5cb591b98c031a780aed29e61b6e7cda77400be9b9641e5c92f7e00a","publickey":"7e387b3ad0628756f22cb380e37acb9b76bca50b300bb297493a50afb728dfc4","commentid":"15","receipt":"b1a15df012ec6ecf259dd9ab6271ed74b80f7d8a961171211e1425234bcde5eff5181943f3dc3cc1bf580258609ceb8db3aca278c393566e53b452228ffcc10a","timestamp":1596542744,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Yes, we do believe that Decred *may* and most likely *will* be doomed if effective marketing is not executed. Memes are part of marketing, even though only a small part and we hope that our proposal will contribute.\n3.  Highlighting the importance of memes is not fear mongering. It is a statement of a psychological phenomena. \n4. **Humans warm to accepting ideas, products, people, and systems through memes.** This has been seen countless time historically. \n5. The memes can be quotes (maybe technical), logos, images, videos, or combinations. \n6. **Every single popular product, person, ideology, anything with a network effect is built on a meme, or more frequently, a series of memes. **\n7. This is currently lacking with respect to Decred and we are proposing a solution to this simple yet important topic. How we wish there was not such a gap and that we could develop other content, which we are certainly capable of. However, we believe this has much higher priority and a low hanging fruit, with high potential impact.\n8. What we do see as fear mongering, at least for us, has been the decline of value of Decred against Bitcoin, against which we are proposing to do something at a super reasonable cost.\n9. Even more fear mongering thing for us has been the fact that some community members (exitus, in specific) state negative sentiment against our proposal, for example saying that it is too expensive at $15/image, which is $30/hour, when they themselves have approved projects of their own (https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/95cfb73) where they are receiving $30/hour. It is fear mongering to see such biased attack on new proposals by those who already are receiving the community's money for their own projects.\n10. We still believe that **strong high quality memes can contribute greatly to the marketing of Decred** if accompanied with widespread use of those memes. We are looking forward to the vote of community.","signature":"3f57b5ae60e7631583285c44d7ea1b0bb96649e3cc24243d768b9808b9993bfee748699445e3b195ef1cd9eb4a000e2ddb5d195fdb047bdb69c5a24225e4fe08","publickey":"7e387b3ad0628756f22cb380e37acb9b76bca50b300bb297493a50afb728dfc4","commentid":"18","receipt":"b14082488a5c8916a45f35000e65e7c0cd447e99f9f0555afa9725a118181e9d657873038d911772a188533e341dd362406a65093e41909741934f638a3bed08","timestamp":1596640076,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
