Other community members may not go to this length to check it out, so you could perhaps improve the accessibility of your portfolio by uploading some images to attach to your proposal.","signature":"e4e564cb3ea9b3c68f6f22341da875feb765ccfb2f01974686d07b88fb22caea2f94ce36d629ca4e33ea2313caf8ac5102c38a32c585aa8e39141164516e630a","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"e38bc5e10e05d086236e74469ce7c4534c4a606488388cdc356cb2dd8e538d30090a98137a1937b3c93caffaf51c4c7bf1939f817c84036481a77a31291dbc07","timestamp":1596195955,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In this case, either Decred would have to hire through upwork or not accept this project.\n\nI don't understand, your team cannot bill using an invoice or somenthing like that? Can you explain better for me, please.","signature":"429dc151a2b72eeca37897315f459e4d170eea72a463b20f2d25e2191ac9cf8a3f418a874e59082fc3564af3ed7ecad8614be699596fc0dd3727bde6e27acb0d","publickey":"8b9ada0d6179d50cfa1ce35814df98988517757c54f76cdbbabf6f99cce42fd8","commentid":"2","receipt":"7dfbbd399fa6f681db644efb97c6c766efaf800f04fc953b764f9f600bb1c7372a2092a93c3c21468446f2e883375a43372415965d9c36a4d7cf7abc07a2db0f","timestamp":1596202424,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
