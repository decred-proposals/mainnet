Design of Social Media Memes for Decred

**What**

As every cryptocurrency project, it is highly important for Decred to have social media visibility and positive word of mouth. To **enhance Decred’s brand identity** on the Internet and enable further social spread, memes can play significant role. Memes are excellent to effectively convey ideas and information and are used very extensively in marketing and all aspects of social interactions.
This project proposal is for **developing 20 memes for Decred** as an initial project, which includes designing of templates for different social platforms, identification of copyright-free non-attribute images, designing of the memes, generation of the (possibly humorous) text for meme, design of visuals for each meme for multiple social platforms, and delivery of all meme image files. 
The project manager for this proposed project is **CryptoArchitecht**. Through May-July 2020, CryptoArchitecht has **created a 40 memes for the CryptoHumorProject initiative**, where each meme teaches a cryptocoin concept with humor. Beginning in mid-August 2020, our work for CryptoHumorProject will be posted online in multiple platforms(Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Facebook) of the initiative, as well as its dedicated website. The objective of CryptoHumorProject initiative is to create and sustaina set of consistently-branded popular online educational social platforms for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. These platforms will teach fundamentals, concepts, applications, and critical points through memes and short explanatory text that accompany each meme. 
We propose to **provide Decred Community with similar high quality social media content**at a fast pace and low cost, building on our specific experience towards creating cryptocurrency memes.
**Design specifications** are that the memes are to be of utmost visual and aesthetic quality, speak to both the Decred and larger cryptocurrency community, cause positive emotions, and express the significance, advantages, and unique values of Decred.

**Why**

**Social popularity and acceptance**, and even hype, play a big role in the success of a crypto coin project. LunarCrush.com and similar websites quantify social activity and it is quite common that coins with **higher social activity** gain in **market acceptance** and **price increases**. One of the most active communities in this respect has been the XRP Army, with their hundreds of graphic designs to promote XRP and Ripple. Some of these stunning designs are available under

**Decred**, as **one of the most interesting crypto coin projects**, deserves further attention and positive word of mouth. The crypto community at large can learn about the benefits of Decred easily through convenient and attractive memes and be more interested in the project.

**How**

This proposal covers design of visuals suitable in dimensions for the following social platforms (and mobile phone covers):

1.	Instagram

2.	Twitter

3.	Reddit

4.	Pinterest

5.	YouTube

6.	Facebook

7.	Linkedin

8.	Zoom (backgrounds)

9.	iPhone X

10.	iPhone 11

Therefore, there will be **a total of 10 visuals for each of the 20 designs.

**Who**

Our team consists of two members: Mr. Eskicioglu and Dr. Ertek
**Mr. Eskicioglu** (CryptoArchitect) is a student of Architecture at Karatay University, Konya, Turkey:

While being a student still, Mr. Eskicioglu has **vast experience** in a variety of topics, including architectural design, graphic design, web design, and 3D visualization. 

Mr. Eskicioglu’s **portfolio for CryptoHumorProject** and CryptoArchitect are as follows:

Mr. Eskicioglu’s **CV and portfolio** of other work is as follows:

**Dr. Ertek**, who will serve as mentor in this project, is a professor of business analytics with an engineering Ph.D. and vast industry and teaching experience. His specializations include artificial intelligence, data science, logistics, and project management. Dr. Ertek has **managed 500+ projects**, most of which are related to information technology and its applications. Dr. Ertek’s personal website, where his publications and projects can be accessed, is http://ertekprojects.com

**Continuity plan**

All Adobe InDesign source files for the visuals will be keptby Mr. Eskicioglu at least until end of 2020 for modification if needed. If there is a need to make changes to any of the visuals, as support, the team will allocate up to 5 hours in total until end of 2020. Therefore, the team will support the project until end of 2020, allocating up to 5 hours free of charge.

**Budget**

The proposal will be **paid in Decred, as a total of 200 DCR** ($2,958 as of July 28, 2020) for the development of **20 designs**. Each design will come in 10 different dimensions and thus image files.
The cost of designs are considerably lower (10 DCR/meme) than designs that would be done on freelance websites, because of the specific experience of the team having created 40 crypto meme designs before. 
The nature and the cost of the project are **consistent with similar earlier Decred proposals** that have been approved:

https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/95cfb73

https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/2ef74fa

The amount is to be transferred with the delivery of the final memes on September 30, 2020 (or within 45 days of the approval). In case of a possible delay, there will be period of 15 days grace period. Therefore, as long as the deliverables are delivered by October 15, 2020 (or within 60 days of approval), the payment is justified. 
If the content is not fully delivered by October 15, 2020(or within 60 days of approval), midnight, Istanbul time, there will be no payment at all. Any work created will still belong to the community.
Payment will fully be made only after all memes are delivered (within 10 days of delivery).
Since we are not a company but individual members of the community, **there will not be any invoice involved.**

**When**

The milestones and deliverables are as follows:

August 15, 2020: Expected approval of the project

September 15, 2020 (or within one month of the approval): Posting of the created memes at http://ertekprojects.com/decredmemes/ (to be constructed) for feedback.

September 25, 2020 (or within 40 days of the approval): Compilation of all the feedback 

**September 30, 2020** (or within 45 days of the approval): **Delivery of the finalized memes**

**Risks**

One risk is that the memes may not be finished on time. There is no risk for Decred community in this case, because payment will fully be made only after all memes are delivered (within 10 days of delivery).
Another risk is that the team cannot provide invoice and this may be needed by Decred. In this case, either Decred would have to hire through upwork or not accept this project.
Yet another risk is that the quality of the visuals may not be satisfying to some members of the community. Yet, it is quite difficult to have all designs be satisfying to all members of the community. The shared portfolio of CryptoArchitect specifically for creating crypto memes is as follows:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/vy14vhn22qhzkos/Mr_Eskicioglu_CryptoArchitecht_Portolio.pdf?dl=0

This portfolio provides an** indication** of whether the results will be satisfying or not. Therefore, approval of the project also shows confidence of the community to the proposal’s output.
