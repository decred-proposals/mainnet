But I also understand the question being raised regarding smaller contributions.\n\nLet's take for example someone who has built a small tool or utility software that doesn't fit in current repos around Decred. This person may be a talented dev and the community may benefit of his work, but he may not necessarily have the time or desire to get a DCC by contributing in other parts of the project before submitting his work.\n\nCould maybe these smaller contributions be an alternate path to obtain the DCC?

I can see how this will be an important building block for the DAE. I did not foresee or anticipate this idea.\n\nI am in full support of it, the only question I have is about the number of contractors required to grant or take a DCC. Would it work if we set a more dynamic number, perhaps via percentage of contractors, of a specific subdomain? My worry is only that revoking someone's DCC usually creates controversy so we must be certain that it will be seen as a legitimate action.\n\nYou wrote:\n\n\u003eIt is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. \n\nThis is exactly my worry, that it would be 3 people who are of the same entity. Does \"ideal\" mean it will be just hoped for, as opposed to enforced? Enforcing this would be difficult. \n\nSo my question is, would you be open to the idea of experimenting with a different number or perhaps a percentage, as opposed to a fixed number 3?

I have a couple of concerns/things to think about:\n\n1. This system strikes me as inherently vulnerable to politics \u0026 corruption. I don't think we can engineer that fact away; we're dealing with something that we can't have the stakeholders directly vote on, due to the domain knowledge required. As a result, this particular process is quite similar to representative democracy (and we all know how that tends to work). Just something to keep in mind, and ensure proper checks and balances to compensate.\n\n2. How much should soft skills factor into issuing DCCs? For example, a developer writes good code, but:\n   - Has very poor written English skills, making communication with other developers very difficult. Or:\n   - Is extremely abrasive to co-workers; uses explicit language to refer to other developers and/or their work when things aren't done his way.\n  \n  On one hand, soft skills are important; on the other hand, this could be taken too far. Different people have different views on what is acceptable behavior, and I wouldn't like to see a conflict similar to a US Senate appointment battle over a DCC.\n3. \u003e These votes would be made by individual DCC holders, not the corporate entities they work for.\n  \n  That's a pretty big assumption. If we're designing a system that's supposed to be robust in adversarial circumstances, we should assume that corporate entities will attempt to force their employees to vote a specific way. Either we need a system that can work in such a case, or we need strict rules and clearly defined consequences for corporate entities engaging in such behavior (e.g. revoking the corporation's ability to bill for X amount of time). I would prefer the latter option.\n4. All-contractor votes being weighted by hours billed seems reasonable, but I'm wondering if such a system could be susceptible to a group of contractors that have performed the majority of work in recent history using this power to either operate a cartel ensuring only they are allowed to work on Decred, or enforcing the status quo and not allowing new developers using newer technologies to work on Decred, resulting in technological stagnation.\n  \n  This could possibly be done if the DCC holders cartel tells the stakeholders that the developers being excluded from getting DCCs are writing genuinely bad code. If most of the stakeholders are non-technical, they will likely assume the existing DCC holders are telling the truth, and allow the cartel to go on right under their noses.\n\n  Perhaps I'm just being paranoid here, and I do admit this scenario is probably pretty unlikely, but it's still worth considering all possible cases IMO.","signature":"2ecdad63d57a2370e80e0841eb33222d45e40a5f26868e5d7d724945b5dd211b8b0c9fc2a43399340c7f04603ab91393afe618aa2c2173dd86270158716de000","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"12","receipt":"a1ab1c2c71b39a6c0ec28572347d7a25d82777e2664d6332c929b79905c22591e8fb76be8854b9171ccd9418e140e29e4ef48f794b8dde7506a5988c1166850e","timestamp":1540044035,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A proper way to grant a contracting license and revoke it when needed.\n\n1. As currently written, this system seems to be highly vulnerable to political preferences in getting more work for their own contracting company, conflict of interests or personal grudges.\n\nFor example: 2 Development Contracting companies. Company A has 5 developers and Company B has 1 developer. Company A can agree to revoke companies B DCC to get their work.\n\n**From proposal:**\n\n\u003e It is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. Auditing these DCC issuance and revocation proposals for conflicts-of-interest will be an ongoing task.\n\nIn my opinion, the contractor's company should have 1 vote. For example Company A with 5 members has 1 vote, Contractor Company with 1 member has 1 vote. \n\nIf left as is, some contracting companies will have a monopoly over the entire project or a branch. I don't think it's healthy for the future of the project.\n\n2. Subdomain voting for granting or revoking DCC.\nHaving 3 contractors in a subdomain vouch for the issuance or revocation of a DCC forces those contractors to have skin-in-the-game when it comes to staffing decisions.\n\nFor example, some contractors work and contribute to multiple subdomains: design, social media/marketing, and events. Taking into consideration votes from only 1 subdomain would be not sufficient.\n\n3. Sub-Contractors\nI totally agree on the need of clearing sub-contractors that work for DCC contractors.\n\n4. Stakeholders\nUltimately, some decisions will go to stakeholders for a final approval as we may not be able to resolve by internal voting.\n\nOverall, this is a step in the right direction an I'm looking forward to more comments and ideas.\n\nThank you!","signature":"4e64c39703443268205d0d1bc8a663c2c421fc2a744f4769b95128d6e200b1cdd351849c20f5bc2814f77fd5cec047cccd57a1bfadc5d391985ddf7f73d0ea0c","publickey":"5a452f52d8cf2f66a84689107273f3b3b292307877ba6d92d01bb2dfebeee236","commentid":"13","receipt":"2249502d6846d9019e007816088d91db88bad4e73e12ffdf52ff67c77af9431035bd0294a670e8b4ae07bec81a366896e7547ee1e55dce38620463f769ae220a","timestamp":1540048864,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Either other contractors or the prospective contractor themselves will ask about the prospective contractor becoming a contractor, and I will then ask other contractors in that subdomain how they feel about adding the prospective contractor.  If someone gives feedback that is particularly negative, I will circle back and speak to other contractors in that subdomain.  Assuming there is not substantial contention about adding the new contractor, the addition occurs.\n\nRegarding more complex threshold algorithms, I suggest we make a point to get a simple working system in place first, then it can be modified based on what we observe happening with the simple system.  I am totally open to exploring the algorithm for these proposals, but it's important we have a working system before we attempt to optimize it.\n\nIn terms of the independence part, the all-contractor vote is meant to be used when questionable actions are taken for issuance and revocation requests, e.g. when the 3 contractors are not at all independent or there is other serious drama attached to the prospective contractor.","signature":"ebf8414bb9c375df6c48754c1d48a7fc0ebd4f545f2bba5db0d60bb0c1f95b25cd73a7ea2e0c60886a74e765e6e5a97e1d3eefe1ffc440ef045114d0997ec309","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"19","receipt":"0dcf539d0368f205cdae26f22ae3d792bc00efc35c185804887c6c3b17138a2aab0ca2fe1ec80daaba88be6fc6aa86bb5207d0973e0e13db71bc95f2f1f39401","timestamp":1540068107,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Every system is vulnerable to politics and corruption.  This proposal is an attempt to make staffing for the project not require my or any other project oracles' involvement.\n\n2. The extent to which soft skills factor into this varies across subdomains.  Historically, we really don't care much about language skills so long as people can adapt to feedback and work constructively within their subdomain.\n\n3. If a corporate contractor is found to be engaging in contractor vote manipulation, the punishment can be determined by an all-contractor vote.  I obviously can't speak for other corporate contractors besides Company 0, but I am really keen to stay out of these kinds of conflicts and let the individuals duke it out.\n\n4. Regarding cartel behavior, which has been shown to be emergent in some systems, or other collusive behavior, this is exactly why I proposed the ability to escalate this to a proposal for stakeholders to vote on.  The scenario you describe is roughly what has happened with Bitcoin, but I have also seen some legitimately bad code that merits scrutiny.  If the stakeholders can be fooled into buying into arguments that boil down to an appeal-to-authority, we have more serious problems than the DCC model.","signature":"7d048c7a1370a542813b6b68ca82f489e7ce7c226973167e0c97a8189f9a2cb603264b48cabdc372f4956e5b6c969961505b4833e6411e948a130ba7b5199408","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"21","receipt":"961111bf90090fcef40b552242e2b6fdfe475582bcc68bf114d7be6742e4994fda81b6b23480ea4ce0dc46324a91df3e6edc0be5a205b65552c3592f86257007","timestamp":1540069072,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In several cases, outright termination was the only real option for contractors who were overbilling and under-delivering.\n\n1. Per my response to ryanzim, every system can be gamed.  There is an escalation process that can address punitive or self-interested actions.  The current system where I mediate these conflicts, or where they are mediated by some other person or group, are also vulnerable to gaming.  Even in the design subdomain where you do some of your work, there are several groups performing work, not just one entity.  This diversity applies to most subdomains, AFAICR.  Corporate contractors only having a single vote creates a substantial incentive against being a corporate contractor, whereas every individual DCC holder being able to vote reflects the skin-in-the-game more accurately.\n\n2. Regarding working in multiple subdomains, I think that it could make sense to allow for a DCC to apply to one or more subdomains, and partial revocations to occur.  It would also make sense for a multi-subdomain contractor to be allowed to vouch in their corresponding subdomains, but their all-contractor vote would be handled the same way as everyone else's.\n\n3. I'm glad you see the value of the subcontractor DCC, as I've dealt with this already and found it quite frustrating.","signature":"2305735873bb504f2ba06eaad2e2ca34f0da62e75023d7c86d3ef5d8414f381906747b31ff50073704829fd42f5b0690e984eec831651016d0ad8e0a3a402e0d","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"22","receipt":"690c7b15ba04f563cf1cd9d55ae8f02abbba7b40807223e6479514ac1b557b75e5c42d96437e9c44e0d8efa143aa12395dbc1216ec2a44d86a2dbb61a656e407","timestamp":1540070268,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

What i am suggesting, however unfavorable it may seems for delegating decision making to a single entity, this process will streamline the contractor hiring process. It is far more efficient, simpler and straightforward than involving 3 entities. While i understand the problem of **autocracy** might arise, we stakeholders will provide the checks and balances to compensate. Each elected individual will be given the power and task with vetting and reviewing the quality of contractors and their works in respective sub domains. He is also accountable for any DCC issuance and revocation. In any case of disputes or conflicts, we can escalate such a dispute here. In the future, should any disputes arise, it will probably be easier to cope with, dealing with only a single elected entity rather than the 3 that might then manifest themselves into a cartel. Just my suggestion.","signature":"d56ccea829b04704a8db4d63ed657e1964183d9126f66e4baa39224d0f12fe35f6ce1292176fb9edeb418b0f0f5bee20db954222b07fed0dd20369c507ca2404","publickey":"dc3e684c91b5be259bc4faf38111506872ef6640260bfb1888cc1cb0d67890bf","commentid":"30","receipt":"13f7fee4dec9a36da6ed210eb309a26a0dfa3c60a9b8a01c71c04fc16d5332ef6d7cfe5ebf3e56b4823679c4c6ce18050d62ab2741c8c2b7643cc4fe2dde2607","timestamp":1540118621,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Elected officials may one day be required for smaller roles that are just inefficient to manage otherwise,  but for something as important as vetting contractors, we should stay clear of it as much as we can.\n\nHaving a central point of authority on a subject imply setting him up as a single point of failure. Even if the elected individual is fair and responsible, if conflict arise with a contractor, the official becomes a single point of frustration for this contractor.  And then it's easy to feel wronged and have the accusations start flying to have this one person replaced even though he may have acted  objectively.\n\nWhen the responsibility falls to a group of multiple contractors there will of course be situation where conflict will occur,  but I believe we remove quite a lot of the possible drama and followup issues.","signature":"a42f357c78e3a9260e844633362ffe4ac89b15595d4ca459fa28ac2533f7935cd7816b71b397ab86210b1fc5be7bed5447fe178f92223221f1f4b8b3b8ca4b09","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"31","receipt":"2061e0b5ed22cc0b97f5eba23b77adc21e5b1eee1c1d4ea734757e17bdd8cf119a09f3cea00ccc7ed2305b0c4d79fde27d43032bd4890cfe0c486274e7b7720c","timestamp":1540130468,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
