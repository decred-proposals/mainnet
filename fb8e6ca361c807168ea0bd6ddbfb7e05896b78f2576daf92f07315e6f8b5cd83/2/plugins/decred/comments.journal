To extend this time i will post a new proposal after 6 months. At this point it should be mentioned again that i don't intend to use the maximum budget! I'm currently assuming 20 minutes for adding an article (decred journal, decred digest, event-reports) with text formatting and pictures. At the moment it's expected that these articles will be available in 2 - 3 different languages. Decred contributors additionally write 4-5 articles per month, in rare cases they are also available in several languages. In addition, there are sporadic video interviews and podcasts from soundcloud. Realistically, i currently assume a maximum effective working time of 5-10 hours per month. In addition, there are server and infrastructure upgrades. Therefore, i keep a frame of 15 hours sufficient. I will only bill for the time i effectively work. So it could end up beeing less than this. I simply have to find out at this point.\n\nThe maximum budget is given because maybe there will be wishes for functional expansion in the future (stats page, timestamping service...) and act as a buffer for unexpected cases. Especially in combination with the marketing effords of the project there could be needs for cross-plattform campaigns. Maybe there could be need for a helping contributor hand on deadline deliverables. \n\nI will give my best to be efficient and keep my workhours low. I have always maintained this attitude towards the project and this will not change.\n\nThe placement of advertisements will not happen! No paid advertisements will be placed on the site in the future. If there are advertising banners, then only for project internal purposes and campaigns which are free for the project.\n\nI could set a lump sum as it is done in other proposals. However, this does not correspond to my imagination, so i decided for an expense allowance after hours because i consider this to be fair. The hardcap also has its purpose, but should never be used completely in the optimal case.","signature":"9beaa596bc28fab98182a6fb80facc9e5716312c8d25aa63be91926d8a848299a74c045005186a3a8802b36eca1306cda8353e9b69f8f440723de69ed138a302","publickey":"e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","commentid":"13","receipt":"e1fbc2b0e98b0d2384045bc6017293ae56fc9306b558ca8aaccf04dcffba09fad78a1928b77e4a0616ee282541dab38629796bffb19b5f0866061a424cb3ae04","timestamp":1550934975,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Here are a few comments.\n\nI feel that lots of aggregation work is already done by Decred Journal. It contains all the recent articles, videos, podcasts and even relevant chats on comms platforms. This makes the utility of this site only marginal in that section.\n\nOn the other hand, i think this will lead to more individual content and take off some load from bee's shoulders. My suggestion would be to update the proposal to list content from different contributors being aggregated e.g. Pi Digest, Haon's medium articles, Journal etc.\n\nI like the mirroring of basic infrstructure services. To be sure, these will be independent instances of these services and not just links to the current instances, right?\n\nYou mention a Newsletter service, is this the same one that is proposed in [2019 Marketing Plan](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e)? If not is this not replication of same service and its costs? How will this be different?\n\nGood to see, although voluntary and unpaid, translation work will be co-ordinated via the site.\n\nApart from above, I have three questions:\n\n- Is this going to slowly replace Journal or both will keep working in parallel?\n\n- What is meant by private and public photo gallery and areas of the site? can you explain with an example what these areas will be used for?\n\n- Why can't this be added to main decred site under say community.decred.org? What are the benefits of doing a separate site?\n\nThanks for your work, looking forward to the updated proposal. I hope this helps.","signature":"17166632cfa300c6128d74797599a5b569616df3a56a42726062a37b4e9e47ce23412c22b7e81566355994ea70e5a1036463fe21216493e4421f7395af33c909","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"16","receipt":"ecfc6b5bef96b8ab773c4e9f104902910fe1546c4d8ec17f5ec792a6666215e53baaed62ebfb33964eb6f1840c3ac2f8813b7830f01f6bb65356e02c4e190207","timestamp":1550972075,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I would like 2-3 people who are able to make backups of the site and place content on it. Currently haon has access and he was introduced to working with the backend. If my response time asks for this situation due to an emergency or vacation, they should be able to tune in and post new content online. In this case they should be balanced out of this budget. What is important to me is that they are trustworthy and know what they are doing, what an introduction requires.\n\nWriters are compensated by the Treasury and publish their articles on various platforms. I think if the project has paid for the production of this content, we should publish it on different platforms and not just keep it on individual platforms. I don't intend to manage the author's activities! I want to give them the opportunity to publish their content on this platform. Also for visibility and censorship resistance to what has happened in the past on the medium with crypto related content producers. I expect decred's main page to be more selective about the content they will publish, as the purpose of the main page is to inform and be more official. The purpose of this community page can be to give new people a chance to get a stance and establish in the project and a playground to try new things. The inspiration for this project came from zcsh and dsh, as they also run successful community outlets that attract engagement and displays healthy community activity.","signature":"0f37176978cab41faf0e6f6fe51c08d40a3283a1adc71e848932443ab51d3a711df6dbadd7ecbf2d798c58d1bb5ad60f5a9c34a3f67d8746b4457d978764d906","publickey":"e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","commentid":"17","receipt":"2303eb5b7502cac13d90f9827aba1008f545a0d2701dbbc0cbbcd6c9fc36f1c9d40e20ac7c3d8414a9ea016ce3cdd7649e1ff0f87a916bb07b439bf9b8ea9e03","timestamp":1550980126,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The high activity of the authors brought me to the idea. I have spoken with various contributors from the field, both in chats and on meetups. The idea was welcomed and I started working on the proposal a while ago.\n\nThe site should only serve as a platform for the output of the decred community. It should not replace anything, it should complement! It should inform and motivate new people to participate in the project. You should keep in mind that different target groups prefer different ways of presentation. Showing presence only on Github or the main page may not be enough.\n\nBasically, every content financed by the treasury should find its place on the site, but not only that. Therefore I don't want to limit myself to certain sections (pi digest, haon, richardred, journal) (see section 'what'). There is no reason why these sections should not be supplemented in the future. Contributor profiles, author profiles, voices of individual stakeholders on certain topics, all the things that have no official character can find their place here.\n\nInfrastructure, of course, are independent instances, this also emerges from the proposal (see 'ongoing budget'). We will use the ressources that the server has available for these.\n\nConcerning the photo galleries I noticed that there are already a lot of pictures of conferences and meetings. These should be displayed clearly instead of being scattered on twitter. Visitors of the Meetups should have the possibility to find each other again. Regarding the privately accessible areas, there was a desire to provide materials especially for investors and the press.\n\nThe main page is informal. A horizontal diversification in the external presentation of the projects should enrich the ecosystem. As I said, I expect a rather conservative attitude from the main page in the future, the outsourced community page can only enrich here.\n\nThere are several possible approaches to the newsletter. Whether this is only used as a subscription for the official newsletter or whether additional content may also be played out here will have to be agreed with the marketing team.","signature":"e499b733aff81c652e0167f9724f32438ca2f6a9fd62d4a15543b15f39409263c3da40cd29955427ff898e7d3e5ed378c34558c216fa3a268906e25269d5db00","publickey":"e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","commentid":"18","receipt":"2e21d8c00b4e9f7fb72faeecdfc79f37e598104e8a8bc144686687e7c279188c116a3787b88f0cec4a215d519afe5a0d52a32f901379db4bbc045e9ac7f9900d","timestamp":1550982697,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
