This proposal builds some important infrastructure the DAE will need to decentralize. It also raises some important unanswered (to my knowledge anyway) questions:\n\n\u003e Prior to the draft transaction being published on-chain, stakeholders will have the opportunity to inspect the proposed spending on the Pi platform and ensure it adheres to proposals already passed on Pi.\n\nHow does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?\n\n\u003e If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention\n\nIs there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month). In recent months, this resulted in a 50% pay cut for contractors that had to sell to USD to pay bills. If stakeholders veto a draft treasury spend, which starts some kind of dispute resolution process and requires another vote, that could cause further disruption in pay that many contractors cannot absorb, and the project may talent (which is expensive to replace). If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above). \n\n\u003e Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.\n\nBasically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?\n\n\u003e Originally, we were keen to have draft Treasury spends be assembled off-chain via Politeia, where stakeholders would approve the draw by voting on the draft transaction. \n\nI think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?\n\n\u003e If the treasury transaction is approved it will be published on-chain and the contractors will be able to redeem their individual payouts.\n\nSo funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?\n\n\nIn general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. \nFor instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain? \n\nIn summary: It seems that the proposal (in its current from) accomplishes  three major things: guardrails on spending (which seem reasonable), safeguards against attack (in the form of a stakeholder veto on spending drafts), and lays down some basic infrastructure that will be needed down the line when further decentralization comes. But I think there are a lot of big unsolved challenges here. This might be a good opportunity to have some (on-chain) discussion of those challenges, and how they might affect the proposed work.","signature":"9df41fb6ebd08eb26666ded59bd3597a97d82f21420cd68473fcee6efea98f09c146fab10b40a8875d06fef1c7b0a24ee2fe190e2695f0b742d36d6d58b8800e","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"4","receipt":"d047297098b5c34c52f629b98b20dc85c1a3becb5874f93339cf4ee0195b38ddcfa10cda5e388c2de89d5b0db96d7baa1803d27e714fdaf2cedb82788250a701","timestamp":1554231347,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
