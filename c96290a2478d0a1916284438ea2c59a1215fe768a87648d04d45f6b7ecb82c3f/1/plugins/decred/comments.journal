This proposal builds some important infrastructure the DAE will need to decentralize. It also raises some important unanswered (to my knowledge anyway) questions:\n\n\u003e Prior to the draft transaction being published on-chain, stakeholders will have the opportunity to inspect the proposed spending on the Pi platform and ensure it adheres to proposals already passed on Pi.\n\nHow does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?\n\n\u003e If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention\n\nIs there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month). In recent months, this resulted in a 50% pay cut for contractors that had to sell to USD to pay bills. If stakeholders veto a draft treasury spend, which starts some kind of dispute resolution process and requires another vote, that could cause further disruption in pay that many contractors cannot absorb, and the project may talent (which is expensive to replace). If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above). \n\n\u003e Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.\n\nBasically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?\n\n\u003e Originally, we were keen to have draft Treasury spends be assembled off-chain via Politeia, where stakeholders would approve the draw by voting on the draft transaction. \n\nI think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?\n\n\u003e If the treasury transaction is approved it will be published on-chain and the contractors will be able to redeem their individual payouts.\n\nSo funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?\n\n\nIn general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. \nFor instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain? \n\nIn summary: It seems that the proposal (in its current from) accomplishes  three major things: guardrails on spending (which seem reasonable), safeguards against attack (in the form of a stakeholder veto on spending drafts), and lays down some basic infrastructure that will be needed down the line when further decentralization comes. But I think there are a lot of big unsolved challenges here. This might be a good opportunity to have some (on-chain) discussion of those challenges, and how they might affect the proposed work.","signature":"9df41fb6ebd08eb26666ded59bd3597a97d82f21420cd68473fcee6efea98f09c146fab10b40a8875d06fef1c7b0a24ee2fe190e2695f0b742d36d6d58b8800e","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"4","receipt":"d047297098b5c34c52f629b98b20dc85c1a3becb5874f93339cf4ee0195b38ddcfa10cda5e388c2de89d5b0db96d7baa1803d27e714fdaf2cedb82788250a701","timestamp":1554231347,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In other words, a malicious treasury spend could never exceed more than a month a half worth of accrued Decred. For better or worse, this also helps to put constraints on budgeting.\n\n2. Yes, that is exactly the plan. We want to test the system out and slowly move current treasury funds to the new treasury pool. Newly generated funds will move into the pool right away. So if we decide not to move any treasury funds right away after about a month and a half we should be funded.\n\n3.

I'll try to address all of these questions and if I miss one let me know.\n\n\u003e How does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?\n\nThat's right. The Pi administrators will publish the transaction that contains the entire treasury spend. People can look at it on the Pi website and comment before it is published for an on-chain vote. The idea is to make a human readable version of this for stakeholder evaluation.\n\n\u003e Is there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month).

If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above).\n\nThis is an accurate statement. The process has not been formalized yet. The reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process.\n\n\u003e Basically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?\n\nSee prior comment.\n\n\u003e I think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?\n\nPoliteia votes are decidedly off-chain. One of the biggest hurdles that will be overcome in this proposal is that we finally marry the two. Only consensus and protocol changes are voted on-chain. The treasury spends will be added to that list with this proposal.\n\n\u003e So funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?\n\nThis is a technical reality. Blockchain can't magically send funds. The process that we will use mirrors the stake reward system. In the end, this should have minor to no impact on UX.\n\n\u003e In general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. For instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain?\n\nThis is a valid concern but this is where I point out that technical people think the other way around :-)\n\nWhat this proposal does is add the basic building blocks we need in order to implement your big vision concerns. Again, the reason why some of those remain undefined is to let reality guide them vs promising something and then not being able to deliver it. Getting this stuff to work is hard enough as it is and then changing a promise during development (which invariably happens) is counterproductive.\n\nAnd no, transactions are not always by definition on-chain. You can construct one and share that with people before pushing it to the mempool for inclusion on the blockchain.\n\n\u003e In summary: It seems that the proposal (in its current from) accomplishes three major things: guardrails on spending (which seem reasonable), safeguards against attack (in the form of a stakeholder veto on spending drafts), and lays down some basic infrastructure that will be needed down the line when further decentralization comes. But I think there are a lot of big unsolved challenges here. This might be a good opportunity to have some (on-chain) discussion of those challenges, and how they might affect the proposed work.\n\nAnd we very much appreciate this.

Each month, the stakeholders would have a direct choice to approve or reject that month's spending. \n\nThe precautions of Pi draft key, constraints on the new OP codes, and staged migration of funds from the old wallet/system to the new, all seem prudent to me. I also appreciate that possible misbehavior of the Pi operators has been included in the threat model (voting on-chain so that Pi admins cannot censor votes). This rationale and motivation is familiar from Politeia itself, where the transparent censorship features have been designed by the same set of people who would have otherwise had power to abuse the system. I take this as further evidence that Company 0 is committed to moving towards a decentralized system that has no special role or privilege for themselves.\n\nSome more specific questions/comments:\n\n1. \"If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention. Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.\" s_ben has [mentioned](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/4) this already, it also stands out to me as a potentially messy and difficult process, should it ever occur. It would be good to have a more detailed walkthrough of what would happen in this scenario, with a prospective timeline. I don't think this is needed yet, it could be done at some point while this system is being engineered. Alternatively, it may be worth breaking the spending down into 2 or 3 payments/domains to start with, in which case the monthly ticket votes would provide a more nuanced signal of how stakeholders perceive the value the Treasury is getting per domain. From a contractor perspective, if the approval rating for these big transactions was trending down month by month, it would be sub-optimal to not have a sense of where the perceived problems lie (e.g. is it on the dev or marketing side?). \n2. The audit tools sound great, I guess they can be applied to all VSP voting?\n3. OP_TSPEND \"Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50%\". This seems reasonable to me but a global cap on Treasury spending is a major decision that should probably be made in a separate proposal.","signature":"c9bf1574744ab1b27b0e92e6a2748f13bd8eb47e97335075d4f3e5606011f6e187fc3e6d53f177de55e0927708e26442663c886698399136fc046c166f43ab00","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"7","receipt":"ba9c8203ef153db3d1ca5a14203fe9f87901ce435937fbf53402c1a5e423e20c4d80798fb1294ec9dc1135d509803efcb235da31b61e124c3b0415d6a86b8101","timestamp":1554241842,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

One of the biggest hurdles that will be overcome in this proposal is that we finally marry the two. Only consensus and protocol changes are voted on-chain.

I believe this is probably the first architecture-level proposal we've had, so it will be interesting to see its development.\n\nI'm going to have to meditate a bit on this, but for the moment  few questions regarding the technical side of things:\n\n1. Given that the pi draft key will need to be part of consensus, what would be the point of a wallet \"distrusting\" the draft key (technical point 6)? It seems to me that once the consensus vote for introducing OP_TGEN/OP_TSPEND is approved, the only action available for a wallet is to vote yes/no/abstain on the spend transaction.\n\n2. Clarifications for:\n\n\u003e Don't allow more than one approved OP_TSPEND per 28 days (8064 blocks)\n\nSo this will also block having two OP_TSPENDs being voted at the same time, right? Obviously I assume the pi operators won't honestly broadcast a new OP_TSPEND before the last one is either decisively voted approved/disapproved, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the consensus semantics for this tx type.\n\nAlso, will this be considered a stake transaction or a regular transaction (and therefore subject to block approval)? I'm assuming onchain voting on approval of TSPEND tx will only start after it's sufficiently confirmed.\n\n3. On the example for the spend transaction, shouldn't inputs be:\n\n```\nin[0] =  \u003cPi draft key sig\u003e TSPEND\n```\n\nthat is, the sigscript is carrying a signature made by the pi draft key vs the key itself. Also, wouldn't it be better for the pi draft key actually be a multisig script or even a schnorr multisig key (with the corresponding p2sh being the consensus-enforced receiver of TGEN txs)? I'm just considering that, in case of a compromised (single) key, all payments would necessarily stop until a consensus change vote to replace the key is carried, which is less critical if it's only a single compromised key from a multisig set.\n\n4. It would be helpful to see an example of a coinbase tx with OP_TGEN (similar to how it was done for OP_TSPEND).\n\n5. Random thought: how about using the extended vote bits to signal approval/disapproval of individual outputs of the TSPEND tx? It would make tallying the votes slightly trickier, but alleviate some concerns about the on-chain voting blocking payment to all contractors due to a single \"undesired\" output (from the pov of voters).","signature":"6d50ee18c4072851056a0eeed6efa70cc1c12f851925190ff6d4caeb6d78e51037b139c6250330167612ba1ae12a0b605298a5bb7de359d5445456f67151da03","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"9","receipt":"b6e07ed3b7fb6f0d4f00a56be41db12cf1259773be86e3a1f37bbad252a9e8748ac11f846efbe4ddc8e188cb36bccccdb5070401c4f98e0dba57b58524c8180e","timestamp":1554292915,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The treasury could theoretically open a cold-wallet escrow account that could hold treasury funds using an approved stable coin for the duration of the draft transaction/voting process.  Once the vote is approved or vetoed, funds would be swapped back to DCR and paid out contractors or put back in the treasury wallet. This would limit price volatility of the contractors payout and could theoretically be accomplished without human approval. However, this may open up new attack vectors and could enable changes in the treasury pool due to price discovery on the underlying asset (DCR) during the voting period.","signature":"7169dcb41fbcc151a7d1e8a8d9c8fd2a7087ce7cd4cabf1a18d93283d9fe0375681ad9f8f2e9dd7c82781bbcd7c867d36753035d2b1152e3736ab1907f61480a","publickey":"26e3c0715a946a4b008eba5702be1e66bd28dac2a706cd59695f8cd20fc10456","commentid":"10","receipt":"3f86e1e6e671f685d26f4dc2df5573301c5f1e91862c332c16b1b8dcf6d795f5fbc466c34a246e2b0dc26bca7f304ee479a7e98182b661ba7488a0aa072d3604","timestamp":1554294667,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Reasonable cost, too.\n\nI have three technical concerns:\n\n1. As others have mentioned, the fact that a vetoed treasury spend on chain delays that entire month's payouts is concerning. Contractors shouldn't be stuck waiting to get paid over contention with a single line item in the spend tx. I would much prefer an output-by-output on-chain approval.\n1. What happens if there is a genuine mistake on the part of the Pi operators in creating the on-chain tx? Would this would be resolved by voting down the entire tx, and trying again next month (possibly running us up to the 150% accrued value limit for the next month)?\n1. There is a limit of one OP_TSPEND per 28 days (8064 blocks). What if there's a drop in hashpower, making 8064 blocks take more than a month to produce? This could result in late payments and disgruntled contractors.","signature":"6ed275a45d7d4f4000535152d4fc1628ec599fb2d9873b244e2f1e1ea0bdcc885049abefef41538fa070fa8b3198cc5af8d4a415d8b9ed509ef7641369d22509","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"12","receipt":"dafb49ac06c888235c4fb9833b30b51f4560d65aecfb7dcdd797b53404de3f4da3e461d22dc2c6d5ab6952223963b1a75e4a261ffa0245a7e3280d68a830b50d","timestamp":1554332543,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It allows the stakeholders to override the ability to spend from the treasury in the case of compromise of the key.\n\n\n2. Yes, that is correct.  There would be a permanent vote bit assigned to voting on a treasury spend in the same way that there is a bit voting for the disapproval of the previous block.   There would be additional `OP_RETURN` data added that specifies the hash of the transaction that is being voted on in the same way that the block that is being voted on is included via that mechanism.  Then there would be separate consensus rules that enforce the spending limits.  That would theoretically allow the potential to spend more than once from the treasury in the future with a voted consensus change as well as allow immediately publishing an amended treasury spend since failure to get enough votes on the initial spend would effectively invalidate the old draft transaction.  These are the types of specific details that would be in the DCP.\n\n\n3.  Yes, the proposal should have specified a signature there.\n\nIn regards to your questions regarding p2sh in terms of key compromise, it would just move the problem into the p2sh instead of the output of the coinbase because the script itself has to be consensus enforced, as you noted, so there would have to be a vote to change the script too.\n\nSomething I think the proposal does not do a good job of explaining is that `OP_TGEN` and `OP_TSPEND` create what is effectively an account for the treasury instead of using the standard utxo model.  The draft key signature also would not have the power to unilaterally spend as `OP_TSPEND` would require both a signature from that key as well as the tally of the yes votes from stakeholders, which acts as an efficient proxy for all of their signatures, to succeed.  That approach also cleanly solves the issue where you would have a bunch of tiny inputs (one per block) in large treasury payouts resulting in massive transactions that would violate size limits.  The outputs of the spending transaction itself can spend to an valid script as usual.\n\n\n4. There isn't much to show since it would consist of exactly one opcode, named `OP_TGEN'.\n\nA current coinbase looks like:\n```\nout[0] = \u003cOP_HASH160 \u003ccurrent treasury script hash\u003e OP_EQUAL\u003e\nout[1] = \u003cOP_RETURN 4e1305004fdcced262afa8dc\u003e\nout[2] = \u003cOP_DUP OP_HASH160 \u003cminer pubkey hash\u003e OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\u003e\n```\n\nA new coinbase under this proposal would look like:\n```\nout[0] = \u003cOP_TGEN\u003e\nout[1] = \u003cOP_RETURN 4e1305004fdcced262afa8dc\u003e\nout[2] = \u003cOP_DUP OP_HASH160 \u003cminer pubkey hash\u003e OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\u003e\n```\n\nIt requires consensus enforcement of only being valid in the very specific case of the first output of a coinbase transaction and that script being required to be exactly `OP_TGEN`.\n\n5. That wouldn't work because a transaction is either valid or it's not.  There is no notion of partially-valid transactions.  The draft transaction is called that in the proposal because that is what it really would be.  It would remain off chain, but publicly available, and would fail validation until all spending conditions were met, namely the new semantics enforced by `OP_TSPEND`.  The result is that if anyone tried to broadcast it before it's valid, it would be rejected, and once it became valid, anyone could broadcast it independently of the Pi operators.

It's a fair concern, but from a technical perspective, there is no notion of partially-valid transactions and attempting to allow that would open a massive can of worms for not only these transactions, but all transactions.  Thus, an output-by-output on-chain approval would effectively require stakeholders having to vote on hundreds or thousands of individual transactions every month which does not seem very reasonable burden to impose.\n\n2. There would be no need to wait a month.  If there were a legitimate problem with the transaction, the draft would simply be scrapped and new draft created.  Quoted what I replied with in a separate comment:\n\n\u003e The draft transaction is called that in the proposal because that is what it really would be. It would remain off chain, but publicly available, and would fail validation until all spending conditions were met, namely the new semantics enforced by `OP_TSPEND`. The result is that if anyone tried to broadcast it before it's valid, it would be rejected, and once it became valid, anyone could broadcast it independently of the Pi operators. That is also why the votes must include the hash of the spending transaction they are voting on.\n\n3. Allowing more than one (but a small number such as perhaps 2 of 3 to prevent attempts at abuse and burdening the stakeholders) per period so long as the sum of the amounts does not exceed the imposed spending limits seems prudent.  It's worth noting though that a drop in hash power would potentially delay payouts regardless of there being a limit.  However, it is true that only allowing 1 per fixed period of blocks could potentially result in slowly pushing the payment date forward if there is loss in hash power that is not eventually offset by an equivalent gain.","signature":"b079b9bc1c8625d31653a634c8f01c89e7718e111ec990d10e49203101d5945d1ea84251b0153465e726f76684613f03f1b86bc1cdca97c3abb670aa0fff560f","publickey":"937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","commentid":"14","receipt":"7827897ae5b7ace7911f3902cf6d50955ed870a94b6379feb700cbfc0a7126f055691319ab12c56de201788f57ce9263f3c25e4683d596d5fc63a46c46423a09","timestamp":1554363849,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Whichever tx is approved with the highest margin within the 2016 block window is considered valid, all others are not.\n\nOn the one hand, introducing an account semantics for the treasury definitely improves scalability and usability (by reducing the utxo set, removing the need for largish payment txs as you said, easier tracking by adding the balance to a header commitment, etc) so that's a nice positive.\n\nOn the other hand, that's a pretty big departure from a utxo-set only architecture, so we'll need to see exactly how that is going to be defined in the future DCP.","signature":"5b493aa89dbdfbb7040f0219188afb96d89d832ea1160f0da30c0e5edbb4348fa26d9d5c7768b7ffd7d1872153fc4252a6eac6cea9533f21f3a8519aae5ef301","publickey":"6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","commentid":"18","receipt":"dd684cd296e19216918e24f9c956fda34338b66b71c6ecb34ed9423950cc9a4295f29fda6bde1b744e8a2b56a9963c93fdee90d85b4d2dffe8fdee334154c90c","timestamp":1554480511,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

These \"I don't like items X, Y, Z\" would not be processed by consensus, rather signal to Pi admins how to construct a replacement tx.

Put simply, not getting the money you billed for is a problem if you can't afford the gamble.\n\nReducing the delay between the end of the billing period (end of month) and the payment reduces the impact of volatility. But to really solve it there must be a mechanism to offer stable pay for desired part of the wage. If that is achieved, the delay can be longer. I can wait another week or two while the spending tx is debated, but I need to get what I bill for.","signature":"bf1a6ced711087a5450ff410ef311288a2abe85a9eac08f43de147ba39cfbb36311425609dc40aeed8596e5a3202181931bb6c51164434c491a84ee8297ace05","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"22","receipt":"d97a62828030d917637a26cdb8b6c15c585cf52661aeed83d5fa6f49c1c0892586a302fa04b611bf54a8dfd3de24c1074c5c0cd6f403e987a6ff12a1aada7b0b","timestamp":1555230806,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There is another risk - they can be coerced to reveal stakeholder information (IP addresses, email addresses, support comms, voting addresses).\n\nEven without pressing VSPs, the fact that many voting addresses are reused helps blockchain analysis to connect the dots. It can be used to identify stakeholders, who can be coerced to vote certain way not only on treasury spend but on blocks, consensus changes and proposals. Or just give away their funds. More stakeholder and voter privacy makes higher security of the network.\n\nWith this design VSPs will play even bigger role than today and be more wanted targets.

This may have many uses, the one I have in mind is an idea to address pay volatility.\n\nAs I have pointed out prior, we are going to start with training wheels. Only allowing one transaction per month at this time. We may consider this in the future.\n\n\u003e How big can the spend tx be - how many payments can be done at once?\n\nCurrent months treasury accumulation + 50%.\n\nHundreds.\n\n\u003e How will stakeholders' vote transactions look like?\n\nThis is indeed not very obvious from the text. What will happen is that we will add a permanent agenda that takes the vote identifier as the parameter and it'll then record the vote bits as any other agenda. We plan to let the user trust the Pi key and always vote per settings. This is to alleviate user interaction. \n\n\u003e Can the VSP vote alert tools be extended to also watch block votes and consensus rule change votes?\n\nThat is part of the plan. We need those anyway so this is a nice excuse to get it all in.\n\n\u003e Why VSPs are needed to vote for the tx? Can't stakeholders just throw their votes into mempool and have them mined?\n\nThat would be great but that is not how it works. Voting requires signatures so something needs to be online to sign hence VSPs exist.\n\n\u003e Do (1) and (2) refer to exactly the same thing? Does \"off-chain\" simply mean it is not immediately published on the chain?\n\nYou have asked this before and the answer is not changing. Yes, they are the same, yes the transaction is published on Pi and not on the blockchain.\n\nDoes it mean two maturation periods or one?\n\nJust one for the treasury transaction. The redeem transaction has normal blockchain rules. Only transactions that generate new coins are subject to maturation.\n\n\u003e Is \"this month\" it defined as a block interval (e.g. 8064 blocks) or a calendar month?\n\nThe plan is to use 8064 blocks.\n\n\u003e Do OP_TSPEND transactions have min and max block height (expiry)? How long can broadcasting of this tx be delayed? Can it slip into next month?\n\nIdeally, it should be voted on before the next month. But I don't see any issues with voting on last months transaction at this time. Reality will set me straight. We will have to add pretty extensive UT for these changes and this is one of the edge cases we are going to have to reason through.\n\n\u003e Is it correct that this design will increase the amount of client communication with VSPs, e.g. the need to login in their web UIs or use the API?\n\nNot really. Should be a one time setting to set voting preferences for the draft key transactions. You can choose to change these as often as you'd like though.","signature":"29dcfda5c78b9cfce58ed1f3f54b6ad3b788244fb7819c786732476af90fff8bd40ef64a703c74da13cfd429d636c5c58323510cfbef82f95d858b970b245d06","publickey":"a3cabbac727b0bce49f1dd2466f38ca62681cd6d48880e1c5ddf28635bf6681e","commentid":"30","receipt":"f077dcf2d4ef0e49d55a96579bfe1fb0b4b487556ded479fcb18a3b75b2f663ef74fcea0157518e37a7b8ce7604d55d63cf61bbc753bd5fe321753a9f5977202","timestamp":1557156249,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Wallets shall receive the capability to trust or not trust the Pi draft key so that they can have a simple user interface for approving or disapproving draft treasury spends.\n\nThe hope is that at all times there will be enough eyes (and automated tools) on the treasury transaction to determine if there is funny business going on. One funny business is found one can raise the alarm bells and inherently more folks will spend some time auditing the transaction to see if they agree with said funny business.\n\nThe timeline is outlined in the proposal.

But I have a suggestion for this constraint:\n\n\"Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50%\"\n\nI think this is fine for a 60% approval threshold. However, I envision unique and one time expenses that could arise in the long term future that could find the above constraint limiting. For example, an acquisition/buy in of a side project or feature like a decentralized oracle infrastructure integrated with Decred, would be expensive. The Decred community may want to make large one time spends from the Decred Treasury in the future. My concern is that the above constraint would prevent these in the first instance, and require a change in the consensus rules first before going through with a large expense. And maybe this should be the case, since it's essentially requiring a pre-vote before the main vote of the large expense.\n\nThere's a couple other ways this could be expanded though.\n\nFor instance:\n\nPrevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50% (requires 60% approval)\n\nPrevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 100% (requires 70% approval)\n\nPrevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 150% (requires 80% approval)\n\nPrevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 200% (requires 90% approval)\n \nPrevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 300% (requires 99% approval)\n\nsomething to think about.","signature":"cf68761a3249b97fa1aa225d0485c0916082d9200b4e60e4d83b59ae38dd79db0fed0d18fdc788282b9b5b392aa28e23eaeed307d6b9f04348f982d069f2870b","publickey":"7be2e523007f116ac22e0d04a715c0ff4e7834d0b85cd656577730efd10a2281","commentid":"39","receipt":"85ab25b315436d23e8e0cf662aedee202b155e4a70829ac5005111031589cdec12a33a1bf53f19e3c6690d92e10e59995f68796708ee86a1356ec94fbca6b30e","timestamp":1557261520,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
