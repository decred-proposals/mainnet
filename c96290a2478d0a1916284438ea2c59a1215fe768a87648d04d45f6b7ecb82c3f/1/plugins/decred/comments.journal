This proposal builds some important infrastructure the DAE will need to decentralize. It also raises some important unanswered (to my knowledge anyway) questions:\n\n\u003e Prior to the draft transaction being published on-chain, stakeholders will have the opportunity to inspect the proposed spending on the Pi platform and ensure it adheres to proposals already passed on Pi.\n\nHow does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?\n\n\u003e If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention\n\nIs there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month). In recent months, this resulted in a 50% pay cut for contractors that had to sell to USD to pay bills. If stakeholders veto a draft treasury spend, which starts some kind of dispute resolution process and requires another vote, that could cause further disruption in pay that many contractors cannot absorb, and the project may talent (which is expensive to replace). If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above). \n\n\u003e Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.\n\nBasically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?\n\n\u003e Originally, we were keen to have draft Treasury spends be assembled off-chain via Politeia, where stakeholders would approve the draw by voting on the draft transaction. \n\nI think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?\n\n\u003e If the treasury transaction is approved it will be published on-chain and the contractors will be able to redeem their individual payouts.\n\nSo funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?\n\n\nIn general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. \nFor instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain? \n\nIn summary: It seems that the proposal (in its current from) accomplishes  three major things: guardrails on spending (which seem reasonable), safeguards against attack (in the form of a stakeholder veto on spending drafts), and lays down some basic infrastructure that will be needed down the line when further decentralization comes. But I think there are a lot of big unsolved challenges here. This might be a good opportunity to have some (on-chain) discussion of those challenges, and how they might affect the proposed work.","signature":"9df41fb6ebd08eb26666ded59bd3597a97d82f21420cd68473fcee6efea98f09c146fab10b40a8875d06fef1c7b0a24ee2fe190e2695f0b742d36d6d58b8800e","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"4","receipt":"d047297098b5c34c52f629b98b20dc85c1a3becb5874f93339cf4ee0195b38ddcfa10cda5e388c2de89d5b0db96d7baa1803d27e714fdaf2cedb82788250a701","timestamp":1554231347,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In other words, a malicious treasury spend could never exceed more than a month a half worth of accrued Decred. For better or worse, this also helps to put constraints on budgeting.\n\n2. Yes, that is exactly the plan. We want to test the system out and slowly move current treasury funds to the new treasury pool. Newly generated funds will move into the pool right away. So if we decide not to move any treasury funds right away after about a month and a half we should be funded.\n\n3.

I'll try to address all of these questions and if I miss one let me know.\n\n\u003e How does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?\n\nThat's right. The Pi administrators will publish the transaction that contains the entire treasury spend. People can look at it on the Pi website and comment before it is published for an on-chain vote. The idea is to make a human readable version of this for stakeholder evaluation.\n\n\u003e Is there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month).

If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above).\n\nThis is an accurate statement. The process has not been formalized yet. The reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process.\n\n\u003e Basically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?\n\nSee prior comment.\n\n\u003e I think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?\n\nPoliteia votes are decidedly off-chain. One of the biggest hurdles that will be overcome in this proposal is that we finally marry the two. Only consensus and protocol changes are voted on-chain. The treasury spends will be added to that list with this proposal.\n\n\u003e So funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?\n\nThis is a technical reality. Blockchain can't magically send funds. The process that we will use mirrors the stake reward system. In the end, this should have minor to no impact on UX.\n\n\u003e In general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. For instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain?\n\nThis is a valid concern but this is where I point out that technical people think the other way around :-)\n\nWhat this proposal does is add the basic building blocks we need in order to implement your big vision concerns. Again, the reason why some of those remain undefined is to let reality guide them vs promising something and then not being able to deliver it. Getting this stuff to work is hard enough as it is and then changing a promise during development (which invariably happens) is counterproductive.\n\nAnd no, transactions are not always by definition on-chain. You can construct one and share that with people before pushing it to the mempool for inclusion on the blockchain.\n\n\u003e In summary: It seems that the proposal (in its current from) accomplishes three major things: guardrails on spending (which seem reasonable), safeguards against attack (in the form of a stakeholder veto on spending drafts), and lays down some basic infrastructure that will be needed down the line when further decentralization comes. But I think there are a lot of big unsolved challenges here. This might be a good opportunity to have some (on-chain) discussion of those challenges, and how they might affect the proposed work.\n\nAnd we very much appreciate this.

Each month, the stakeholders would have a direct choice to approve or reject that month's spending. \n\nThe precautions of Pi draft key, constraints on the new OP codes, and staged migration of funds from the old wallet/system to the new, all seem prudent to me. I also appreciate that possible misbehavior of the Pi operators has been included in the threat model (voting on-chain so that Pi admins cannot censor votes). This rationale and motivation is familiar from Politeia itself, where the transparent censorship features have been designed by the same set of people who would have otherwise had power to abuse the system. I take this as further evidence that Company 0 is committed to moving towards a decentralized system that has no special role or privilege for themselves.\n\nSome more specific questions/comments:\n\n1. \"If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention. Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.\" s_ben has [mentioned](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/4) this already, it also stands out to me as a potentially messy and difficult process, should it ever occur. It would be good to have a more detailed walkthrough of what would happen in this scenario, with a prospective timeline. I don't think this is needed yet, it could be done at some point while this system is being engineered. Alternatively, it may be worth breaking the spending down into 2 or 3 payments/domains to start with, in which case the monthly ticket votes would provide a more nuanced signal of how stakeholders perceive the value the Treasury is getting per domain. From a contractor perspective, if the approval rating for these big transactions was trending down month by month, it would be sub-optimal to not have a sense of where the perceived problems lie (e.g. is it on the dev or marketing side?). \n2. The audit tools sound great, I guess they can be applied to all VSP voting?\n3. OP_TSPEND \"Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50%\". This seems reasonable to me but a global cap on Treasury spending is a major decision that should probably be made in a separate proposal.","signature":"c9bf1574744ab1b27b0e92e6a2748f13bd8eb47e97335075d4f3e5606011f6e187fc3e6d53f177de55e0927708e26442663c886698399136fc046c166f43ab00","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"7","receipt":"ba9c8203ef153db3d1ca5a14203fe9f87901ce435937fbf53402c1a5e423e20c4d80798fb1294ec9dc1135d509803efcb235da31b61e124c3b0415d6a86b8101","timestamp":1554241842,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
