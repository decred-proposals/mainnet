Thank you for submitting this, I'll be honest with you, my spontaneous reaction to this was: \"bold move to request an increase in funding for non-dev work during these difficult times (winter)!\" \n\n---\n\nRegarding your future plans, the part about \"*auditing stakeholders' privacy when participating in governance*\" sounds especially useful and necessary. Thumbs up for that one. \n\nI also like the idea of trying to publish to that Nakamoto journal. pi_crumbs is also a success. Does this Proposal include the Journal, or is that separate?\n\nAs for the bulletin points:\n\n\u003e profiling the stakeholders' Pi voting decisions to see if there are any interesting clusters that tend to vote the same way on proposals of the same type.\n\nPerhaps unnecessary? I don't see why this kind of profiling of voters and collecting data on their voting habits would be necessary. How can we use this data? How can it help the project?\n\n\u003e the obvious question being whether PoW miners are selling or staking. This has been on my radar for a long time, after recent explorations it seems achievable.\n\nOK, this is interesting. Although not the information we necessarily need, it's interesting. Same question as above: what would be the aim of this research? Would it be to signal bullishness about DCR as a future store-of-value?\n\n\u003e  Collaborating with and/or replicating the work of other researchers who are looking at Decred's on chain data. With @checkmate and @permabullnino now working on this kind of data I'm more interested to engage with it because there could be opportunities to help each other out and improve our outputs, plus sometimes it's more fun to work with other people.\n\nI don't understand this item. Why would you replicate the work they are already doing?  \n\n\u003e Collection and analysis of Decred-related (social) media data is still on the table\n\nUnnecessary, I think. \"Social media analysis\" is not something I want to be funding during times like these. If anything, it should be part of the Marketing Proposal that should be posted soon.  \n\n\u003erequested budget ($25,000) runs out, which would probably be around 6 months.\n\nSo $4166/month, give or take? How many contributors worked on this so far? How many contributors do you expect to work on this? Is it most likely just you?\n\n---\n\nThis research is interesting stuff but when on Pi, I need to put my stakeholder hat on. I remind myself that this is, after all, a store-of-value.  I tried to orient myself by checking how other projects are funding research and what kind of research.  I took our sister project, Monero as an example. Of course, the important difference is that in Monero and other coins that are based on donation rather than a \"dev tax\", the whales will be the ones funding things, for the most part, but in DCR, every holder does, and this is perhaps burdening the smaller holders the most.   I checked their funding campaign for research of Q1 2020 as an example: https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/sarang-2020-q1.html\n\nThe researcher is Dr. Sarang Noether,  a mathematician and cryptographer, asking for $30k for 3 months cca. This is what his research is on:\n\n\u003e Protocol research [...] security models, proofs, and preprints for CLSAG, DLSAG, and Triptych [...] add multisignature support for Triptych and RingCT 3.0 to extend functionality.\n\n\u003eGraph-theoretic analysis. This research is ongoing with colleague Surae Noether, with a lot of new code and math to review relating to blockchain analysis.\n\nIt's cryptography research by a mathematician and directly relevant to the CC tech, informing the developers with crucial insights they use to develop software.\n\nPerhaps stripping your proposal down to research topics that are of direct interest to DCR stakeholders, like DCR market/liquidity analysis, would be a good idea. Or research that helps DCR devs. Maybe a dev will chime in to inform me,  I just don't understand why the research in EOS and Algorand is essential. Isn't it just academic? Do you feel that research ever resulted in something actionable, something that directly helped the DCR project?\n\nYou also mentioned you were thinking of creating materials to explain LN and to ease people's use of LN, on Matrix, which sounded like a good project to me. Perhaps worth including it?  What other things could help with adoption?\n\nDo we need to fund research on ICO projects or analysis of Pi voters habits etc.? I don't see what we gain by so much active research of Algorand and EOS.  I mean, there's value in that, but does the Treasury really need to fund it? It has to somehow be relevant to the development or facilitating adoption. Your cryptocommons book did receive favorable mentions on Twitter which was nice to see.  At the same time, it seems to be more of your personal project. \n\n---\n\nYou've done good work with the research on the DCR market data, having someone analyze the workings of the market maker was useful. I consider you a hard-working, good asset for the project and I commend you for coming to Pi to ask for funding. I look forward to others doing the same. The whole point of having Pi is to scrutinize. Everyone should go through this 'trial' before getting funded. (Unfortunately, there's lots of stuff that is funded outside of Pi, I think, that the scrutiny of the stakeholders cannot reach. All contractors, especially those not working on code that is crucial to the project, should do the right thing and, like you, come here and ask for funding.)\n\nI'm looking forward to your answers to the above, I think DCR is still an experiment not only in terms of the tech but also, we don't even know yet, what we want to be funding: only things that are directly beneficial to the cryptocurrency or even things that are only tangentially related? So these are conversation we still need to have, I feel. Obviously they will come up more during winters. That cannot be helped.

It also strengthened my conviction in Decred. Having greater insight into other projects allows all of us to gauge better where Decred stands and how all of this works. None of this, of course, exists in a vacuum. Which is why I'm not opposed to research that only ostensibly appears unrelated to the project. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that statement if PPCC wasn't as of high quality as it is. I do, however, believe that perhaps Phase 3 could be more narrowly focused and that answers to Praxis's concerns fleshed out.

The idea is to engage more with other contributors, but if that doesn't happen it would just mean the budget lasts longer. I don't plan to increase the amount of time I spend on this as compared to the last 7.5 months.\n\n\u003e Does this Proposal include the Journal, or is that separate?\n\nThis doesn't include Journal work, but there does tend to be a good amount of overlap between Relevant External and the crypto-governance-research project. For example if I cover a project on crypto-governance-research that sometimes generates items which I can copy/paste or quickly re-write for the Journal. Also it's not really possible to cover news about a project's governance accurately without getting to know it to at least some degree, which in practice amounts to collecting the kind of answers crypto-governance-research is looking for.\n\n\u003e I don't see why this kind of profiling of voters and collecting data on their voting habits would be necessary. How can we use this data? How can it help the project?\n\nGood questions. I think of the motivation for this as similar to the motivation of the privacy auditing research - whatever can be done easily will probably be done by external parties without transparency, they would have whatever edge it gives them unless there is an open version of the same research. I also think understanding the stakeholders' positions on issues in more detail is good generally as it makes them more of a known quantity which lends itself to greater predictability for the network.\n\nTo the question about the purpose of monitoring reward flows I would say the point is just to better understand the activity on the Decred blockchain and how different ecosystem actors are contributing.\n\n\u003e Why would you replicate the work they are already doing? \n\nReplication is a core aspect of the scientific method, and having two independent researchers produce the same results gives a greater confidence that the results are accurate. I'm not talking about spending much time on this, but if we're working on the same data-sets then easy opportunities to replicate analyses could emerge and would be a bonus.\n\n\u003e So $4166/month, give or take? How many contributors worked on this so far? How many contributors do you expect to work on this? Is it most likely just you?\n\nIn the first 2 phases there were I think 4 other people besides me who billed some hours. I don't know exactly what others billed but I believe I accounted for most of the budgets. The first 2 phases have also tended to go a little longer than expected with their budgets (last phase was 7.5 months rather than 6). I don't know how many contributors would work on phase 3 but I hope it's not just me! \n \n\u003e  I just don't understand why the research in EOS and Algorand is essential. Isn't it just academic?\n\nI wouldn't describe it as \"essential\", but I do think it is valuable. In practical terms, for a project to be \"leading\" on governance, I would expect it helps if the people associated with it know about the governance of other projects - for Decred I think that extends to the stakeholders, or at least vocal stakeholders. For me though the real value is indirect, and comes from helping to improve the level of understanding of blockchain governance generally. This is a new and important subject where the \"state of the art\" is still not very advanced and thus relatively easy to improve upon. As a project with high-functioning governance, Decred should also stand to benefit from a better general understanding of the subject.\n\n\u003e I mean, there's value in that, but does the Treasury really need to fund it? It has to somehow be relevant to the development or facilitating adoption\n\nI see where you're coming from but at the same time the [\"governance models research\" suggestion](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/14) was one of the highest scoring comments when I originally sought research ideas, and was firmly part of the proposition when the last proposal was approved. I'm not really considering to drop it unless I get that kind of feedback from more stakeholders this time around.\n\nI don't think having this less directly beneficial research included in the scope really detracts from directly useful research. As noted in the proposal, I tend to switch to whatever task seems most pressing, so it's not really an issue with regard to my own time. The crypto-governance-research project and cryptocommons.cc are quite different in character to the more quantitative stuff, so switching to them for a break every now and then also helps me to avoid burn-out. \n\nThe cost of the program is modest enough that I don't think it is preventing other research proposals from being funded either, so it's not a scenario where choosing to fund this program means not funding another one which offers more directly beneficial research.\n\nIf I really had to rank the different aspects of the program in terms of overall benefit to the project over the long-term, I would put cryptocommons.cc and related work near the top, but I'm not sure I can articulate the reasons why or make that case very well at present.\n\n\u003e You also mentioned you were thinking of creating materials to explain LN and to ease people's use of LN, on Matrix, which sounded like a good project to me. Perhaps worth including it? What other things could help with adoption?\n\nI'm still thinking about it, but it's probably not research so much as helping with docs. Maybe when I get into it I'll see more room for research.\n","signature":"2c039f7fd0dd0f5c3d5a2f5644133def17fb7fe9bc1a4922a72cbe79dfefbfd6fca9ac13751638ada9a086dab1cac97162b6684b3642d2d2067402b661627c0d","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"0125fd855fe13702e31c719cf0fcc09208c6823329a0f2acee3824e36c07c846153bbef80041dc8347f4ff1b9da77a94d47a2140e8c630f8c31940bdda1b560a","timestamp":1578967698,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
