Thank you for submitting this, I'll be honest with you, my spontaneous reaction to this was: \"bold move to request an increase in funding for non-dev work during these difficult times (winter)!\" \n\n---\n\nRegarding your future plans, the part about \"*auditing stakeholders' privacy when participating in governance*\" sounds especially useful and necessary. Thumbs up for that one. \n\nI also like the idea of trying to publish to that Nakamoto journal. pi_crumbs is also a success. Does this Proposal include the Journal, or is that separate?\n\nAs for the bulletin points:\n\n\u003e profiling the stakeholders' Pi voting decisions to see if there are any interesting clusters that tend to vote the same way on proposals of the same type.\n\nPerhaps unnecessary? I don't see why this kind of profiling of voters and collecting data on their voting habits would be necessary. How can we use this data? How can it help the project?\n\n\u003e the obvious question being whether PoW miners are selling or staking. This has been on my radar for a long time, after recent explorations it seems achievable.\n\nOK, this is interesting. Although not the information we necessarily need, it's interesting. Same question as above: what would be the aim of this research? Would it be to signal bullishness about DCR as a future store-of-value?\n\n\u003e  Collaborating with and/or replicating the work of other researchers who are looking at Decred's on chain data. With @checkmate and @permabullnino now working on this kind of data I'm more interested to engage with it because there could be opportunities to help each other out and improve our outputs, plus sometimes it's more fun to work with other people.\n\nI don't understand this item. Why would you replicate the work they are already doing?  \n\n\u003e Collection and analysis of Decred-related (social) media data is still on the table\n\nUnnecessary, I think. \"Social media analysis\" is not something I want to be funding during times like these. If anything, it should be part of the Marketing Proposal that should be posted soon.  \n\n\u003erequested budget ($25,000) runs out, which would probably be around 6 months.\n\nSo $4166/month, give or take? How many contributors worked on this so far? How many contributors do you expect to work on this? Is it most likely just you?\n\n---\n\nThis research is interesting stuff but when on Pi, I need to put my stakeholder hat on. I remind myself that this is, after all, a store-of-value.  I tried to orient myself by checking how other projects are funding research and what kind of research.  I took our sister project, Monero as an example. Of course, the important difference is that in Monero and other coins that are based on donation rather than a \"dev tax\", the whales will be the ones funding things, for the most part, but in DCR, every holder does, and this is perhaps burdening the smaller holders the most.   I checked their funding campaign for research of Q1 2020 as an example: https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/sarang-2020-q1.html\n\nThe researcher is Dr. Sarang Noether,  a mathematician and cryptographer, asking for $30k for 3 months cca. This is what his research is on:\n\n\u003e Protocol research [...] security models, proofs, and preprints for CLSAG, DLSAG, and Triptych [...] add multisignature support for Triptych and RingCT 3.0 to extend functionality.\n\n\u003eGraph-theoretic analysis. This research is ongoing with colleague Surae Noether, with a lot of new code and math to review relating to blockchain analysis.\n\nIt's cryptography research by a mathematician and directly relevant to the CC tech, informing the developers with crucial insights they use to develop software.\n\nPerhaps stripping your proposal down to research topics that are of direct interest to DCR stakeholders, like DCR market/liquidity analysis, would be a good idea. Or research that helps DCR devs. Maybe a dev will chime in to inform me,  I just don't understand why the research in EOS and Algorand is essential. Isn't it just academic? Do you feel that research ever resulted in something actionable, something that directly helped the DCR project?\n\nYou also mentioned you were thinking of creating materials to explain LN and to ease people's use of LN, on Matrix, which sounded like a good project to me. Perhaps worth including it?  What other things could help with adoption?\n\nDo we need to fund research on ICO projects or analysis of Pi voters habits etc.? I don't see what we gain by so much active research of Algorand and EOS.  I mean, there's value in that, but does the Treasury really need to fund it? It has to somehow be relevant to the development or facilitating adoption. Your cryptocommons book did receive favorable mentions on Twitter which was nice to see.  At the same time, it seems to be more of your personal project. \n\n---\n\nYou've done good work with the research on the DCR market data, having someone analyze the workings of the market maker was useful. I consider you a hard-working, good asset for the project and I commend you for coming to Pi to ask for funding. I look forward to others doing the same. The whole point of having Pi is to scrutinize. Everyone should go through this 'trial' before getting funded. (Unfortunately, there's lots of stuff that is funded outside of Pi, I think, that the scrutiny of the stakeholders cannot reach. All contractors, especially those not working on code that is crucial to the project, should do the right thing and, like you, come here and ask for funding.)\n\nI'm looking forward to your answers to the above, I think DCR is still an experiment not only in terms of the tech but also, we don't even know yet, what we want to be funding: only things that are directly beneficial to the cryptocurrency or even things that are only tangentially related? So these are conversation we still need to have, I feel. Obviously they will come up more during winters. That cannot be helped.

It also strengthened my conviction in Decred. Having greater insight into other projects allows all of us to gauge better where Decred stands and how all of this works.

I wouldn't necessarily agree with that statement if PPCC wasn't as of high quality as it is.

The idea is to engage more with other contributors, but if that doesn't happen it would just mean the budget lasts longer. I don't plan to increase the amount of time I spend on this as compared to the last 7.5 months.\n\n\u003e Does this Proposal include the Journal, or is that separate?\n\nThis doesn't include Journal work, but there does tend to be a good amount of overlap between Relevant External and the crypto-governance-research project. For example if I cover a project on crypto-governance-research that sometimes generates items which I can copy/paste or quickly re-write for the Journal. Also it's not really possible to cover news about a project's governance accurately without getting to know it to at least some degree, which in practice amounts to collecting the kind of answers crypto-governance-research is looking for.\n\n\u003e I don't see why this kind of profiling of voters and collecting data on their voting habits would be necessary. How can we use this data? How can it help the project?\n\nGood questions. I think of the motivation for this as similar to the motivation of the privacy auditing research - whatever can be done easily will probably be done by external parties without transparency, they would have whatever edge it gives them unless there is an open version of the same research. I also think understanding the stakeholders' positions on issues in more detail is good generally as it makes them more of a known quantity which lends itself to greater predictability for the network.\n\nTo the question about the purpose of monitoring reward flows I would say the point is just to better understand the activity on the Decred blockchain and how different ecosystem actors are contributing.\n\n\u003e Why would you replicate the work they are already doing? \n\nReplication is a core aspect of the scientific method, and having two independent researchers produce the same results gives a greater confidence that the results are accurate. I'm not talking about spending much time on this, but if we're working on the same data-sets then easy opportunities to replicate analyses could emerge and would be a bonus.\n\n\u003e So $4166/month, give or take? How many contributors worked on this so far? How many contributors do you expect to work on this? Is it most likely just you?\n\nIn the first 2 phases there were I think 4 other people besides me who billed some hours. I don't know exactly what others billed but I believe I accounted for most of the budgets. The first 2 phases have also tended to go a little longer than expected with their budgets (last phase was 7.5 months rather than 6). I don't know how many contributors would work on phase 3 but I hope it's not just me! \n \n\u003e  I just don't understand why the research in EOS and Algorand is essential. Isn't it just academic?\n\nI wouldn't describe it as \"essential\", but I do think it is valuable. In practical terms, for a project to be \"leading\" on governance, I would expect it helps if the people associated with it know about the governance of other projects - for Decred I think that extends to the stakeholders, or at least vocal stakeholders. For me though the real value is indirect, and comes from helping to improve the level of understanding of blockchain governance generally. This is a new and important subject where the \"state of the art\" is still not very advanced and thus relatively easy to improve upon. As a project with high-functioning governance, Decred should also stand to benefit from a better general understanding of the subject.\n\n\u003e I mean, there's value in that, but does the Treasury really need to fund it? It has to somehow be relevant to the development or facilitating adoption\n\nI see where you're coming from but at the same time the [\"governance models research\" suggestion](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/14) was one of the highest scoring comments when I originally sought research ideas, and was firmly part of the proposition when the last proposal was approved. I'm not really considering to drop it unless I get that kind of feedback from more stakeholders this time around.\n\nI don't think having this less directly beneficial research included in the scope really detracts from directly useful research. As noted in the proposal, I tend to switch to whatever task seems most pressing, so it's not really an issue with regard to my own time. The crypto-governance-research project and cryptocommons.cc are quite different in character to the more quantitative stuff, so switching to them for a break every now and then also helps me to avoid burn-out. \n\nThe cost of the program is modest enough that I don't think it is preventing other research proposals from being funded either, so it's not a scenario where choosing to fund this program means not funding another one which offers more directly beneficial research.\n\nIf I really had to rank the different aspects of the program in terms of overall benefit to the project over the long-term, I would put cryptocommons.cc and related work near the top, but I'm not sure I can articulate the reasons why or make that case very well at present.\n\n\u003e You also mentioned you were thinking of creating materials to explain LN and to ease people's use of LN, on Matrix, which sounded like a good project to me. Perhaps worth including it? What other things could help with adoption?\n\nI'm still thinking about it, but it's probably not research so much as helping with docs. Maybe when I get into it I'll see more room for research.\n","signature":"2c039f7fd0dd0f5c3d5a2f5644133def17fb7fe9bc1a4922a72cbe79dfefbfd6fca9ac13751638ada9a086dab1cac97162b6684b3642d2d2067402b661627c0d","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"0125fd855fe13702e31c719cf0fcc09208c6823329a0f2acee3824e36c07c846153bbef80041dc8347f4ff1b9da77a94d47a2140e8c630f8c31940bdda1b560a","timestamp":1578967698,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Research and everything else that is done from Treasury should contain a \"this has been sponsored by the Treasury\".  \"Funded by DCR Treasury\" doesn't necessarily imply bias, but it's fair to disclose that it's paid content.  If research on cigarette smoking was sponsored by Philip Morris, you'd want to know that.   If the research is objective and based on demonstrable stats, then it wouldn't matter anyway.

It provides a sound and well thought through perspective and  aggregates historical artifacts and events that otherwise get lost in the weeds (like examples of governance decisions). I fully support your proposal to evaluating the behaviour of Politeia and vote behaviour. The reality is with this research, you never know what you might find and in an open source project, complete transparency is valuable. I would comment that whilst market forces are putting pressure on price, I am more keen to see Decred only research, except for key direct competitors (Bitcoin, Dash(lol) et al).\n\nA suggested research topic to consider is putting on your adversarial thinking hat and investigate if ticket/DCR distribution and vote behaviour potentially indicates large scale adversarial behaviour (or not). Studying the 'baseline' of normal activity could lead to signals that are deemed abnormal where the network can react down the line. A key question and FUD buster is whether Decred small enough right now that majority of actors are honest = normal behaviour (i.e. likelyhood of large infiltrators or centralised entities accumulating tickets is low (high)).\n\nI look forward to your venture down the on-chain dcrdata phase, this is an area I will also be exploring and there will be valuable collaborations here.  On that note, I would like some more clarity regarding the expectation of collaboration and the increased budget in response. Given market forces, I wonder if maintaining just your own budget at this stage is appropriate and if contributors show up with legit work, a new or renewed proposal can be submit?\n\nGood Luck with the vote and keep up the great work.","signature":"763d5c0df105d6fa73cfe0aced1037837355f7172b1607ee226158ab421909934584d00ed40bb5b301cee35219b9a4572292f4156343dc74430632328a78010c","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"11","receipt":"24067b5b0afba3b116083ff369435e78cc657ffcc7d443ac8dd6b3775dd0a2d3739176fdc4b98f24c24ca145c9d762b975a5c7812ca5a77e343d7cce1283dc03","timestamp":1579095611,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I thought about asking other contributors to report their billing to me separately but that would be duplication of effort and I feel it's not my place to push people to disclose this information to me. Also one of the things I like about working on Decred is that this kind of \"management\" friction is minimized, it's not something I want to spend a lot of time on. I'm looking forward to further developments of the CMS which facilitate greater transparency within contributors to a sub-project.\n\n\u003e I think it's important to track these kinds of things, how else do we know what is deemed important i.e. worth spending time on and what's not?

I am generally opposed to focusing on metrics because choosing poor metrics leads to people maximizing the wrong things.

To consider the subject of \"cryptocurrency adoption\" for example means in my view looking at the space more broadly and what's happening in different projects. \n\nI also think research which is \"Decred only\" has a different audience to more general research, and it's good for the project to have both types of output.\n\nIf it's the crypto-governance-research overviews in particular that people do not see as much value in I could remove that sub-project from the scope. Most of the feedback I have had about that sub-project has been positive, but if people have been quietly not appreciating it then now is the time to speak up.\n\n\u003e A suggested research topic to consider is putting on your adversarial thinking hat and investigate if ticket/DCR distribution and vote behaviour potentially indicates large scale adversarial behaviour (or not). Studying the 'baseline' of normal activity could lead to signals that are deemed abnormal where the network can react down the line. A key question and FUD buster is whether Decred small enough right now that majority of actors are honest = normal behaviour (i.e. likelyhood of large infiltrators or centralised entities accumulating tickets is low (high)).\n\nGreat suggestion, thanks. I'm looking forward to getting deeper into that data, and have been pleasantly surprised by what it's possible to pick out with just basic queries. I'm making notes of some questions and old issues/discussions to consult for inspiration but I have found from past experience it's better to just get stuck in and the right questions become obvious as you get deeper.\n\n\u003e I look forward to your venture down the on-chain dcrdata phase, this is an area I will also be exploring and there will be valuable collaborations here. On that note, I would like some more clarity regarding the expectation of collaboration and the increased budget in response. Given market forces, I wonder if maintaining just your own budget at this stage is appropriate and if contributors show up with legit work, a new or renewed proposal can be submit?\n\nThe CMS is progressing in ways which will facilitate better handling of teams or sub-domains. In the previous proposal I identified pain points in working with other contributors on the program, about lack of insight around how much of the proposal's budget is going where. As CMS gets better at handling this kind of scenario, I thought to expand the research program by commissioning other contributors to take on tasks with fixed maximum budgets. I am thinking here specifically in relation to \"Politeia Decision Support\" - where the scale of the data collection or analysis required would often be too small to warrant its own proposal. Whether it happened would depend on what kind of opportunities arise and whether people are keen to take them on.\n\nFor the open source research program this seems like a good time to expand the number of contributors, there are more community members with relevant skills and the issues encountered previously are being addressed. I appreciate that some people are taking exception to an expanding budget at a time of low DCR price, which is fair enough. At the same time though I don't think a $5k increase on a project that is expected to run for 6+ months is all that significant, when it would be paying for a greater amount of work as opposed to a higher hourly rate for workers. I'm considering it and will see if there are any more comments on this aspect before deciding whether to edit the proposal.","signature":"ca4b7b89f977061f171a266bc129958599dc257517fff71f3d8a57341d01bd0706806577d90ff485af6318ac1812fd6830f194a7910f7e068f5b1ac2ddb1fc02","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"13","receipt":"2b39ab6cfdbbd3836bc5b9d7580103caec6796ef65c4d8f1ef3452ca1422afd9b1588e4d7683d294ef711f7268e098b165a4c7770b47126bfc93705b353ca006","timestamp":1579112638,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let's keep this going. To add some context to a couple criticisms I see here:\n\n**Contractors selling are depressing the price**\n\nThere seems to be a lot of focus on this, here and elsewhere. While it's a legitimate concern, it seems a little out of proportion considering the Treasury only gets 10% of the block rewards. PoW miners and PoS stakers get 60% and 30%, respectively, and are probably more likely to be selling to cover costs (esp PoW). $25k spread over 6 months (probably longer considering previous OSS proposals went longer), is probably a drop in the bucket. And that's assuming it's sold not staked (I'm not asking @richard_red to answer that here, that's his business. But many contractors stake most (or all) of their DCR payments). It would be good to have better data on this. Which is why I think a compelling aspect of the proposed research is analyzing where block rewards go. \n\n**There's \"fluff\" here we don't need**\n\nThis is a legitimate concern. However, as a contractor myself for ~1.5 yrs, you should keep in mind that a) most contractors are highly skilled and took a large pay cut to work here for ideological reasons, and b) most contractors already do a ton of work that isn't billable under the current system. Some months I've billed for less than %50 of the hours I worked on Decred. Is that work all billable at 100% of my hourly rate? Probably not. Is it worth $0? No. Like many contractors, @richard_red lives, eats, breathes Decred, and presumably does a lot of work that is never billed. I would view doing some external research into say, Algorland, as a form of compensation for that (in addition to adding to a valuable body of work that is being noticed in the space). \n\nFull disclosure: I am a contractor that has billed hours against previous OSS research proposal. Though that is maybe 10 hours total in a year, and I have not talked to @richard_red about collaborating on this round. \n","signature":"e3fee8f680dc5b755dc7e97f9c2bf5a9585f05e050602bd3968e1f697349fa333f6635929dda1397be93d94e22c782170d1a96953317d409f3f92f4173add805","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"14","receipt":"9dba3ff62a2a26c0407df8fac16b6fcd9456da3a3ad0ecd9f1a9193976d8eccf566c613c5327581d412368c04fceabbb1c3ad7c49a9ecfe1c88cdfbea3c86209","timestamp":1579123755,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think the added request for $5000 is reasonable to accommodate greater participation of stakeholders in research studies where their input may be for a very defined scope of work that may be non-recurring, I don't think it's the best use of time and resources to write new proposals for small bits of work that can fit under this umbrella. \n\nI think it is important to build upon and sustain work in areas where people have stepped up, shown value, and continue to drive value creation.  While there are areas where greater transparency would be nice, most of the limitations on this data are based on limitations that are being currently worked on on the CMS data entry and reporting capabilities. \n\nI trust Richard and his judgement, his track record speaks for itself. \n\nI will be supporting this proposal.\n\n","signature":"10bdba152924e8e6e2201eaadaf06c5669c8a3162dfe17fa67c7d4b2ac0c8bb8ca3e4214ff9a472a04b6b16081140dd8b1b715d86dd6b71e0dda162dc7b66801","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"15","receipt":"b57114508bcd71da9890d81fa92ea0e3c656d71792cdd0203d519f22417008ee85df59074983a65d6d7509595a5be8d85cdacc99424c82eedb75a3d34b50cb06","timestamp":1579123978,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

No where else is there such a well evolved and structured chance to surface the complexities and mess of opinions that makes up the collective decision making of a nascent digital network. \n\nIt was RichardRed's Medium articles that first alerted me to the depth of research surrounding Decred. The intelligence and accessibility of the writing was something that encouraged me to look deeper at the project and to ultimately join the community discussion. \n\nRichardRed shared the Crypto Commons resource with me and asked if I had any feedback. So not only was the project interesting, but there was a way to contribute. This is one of the defining parts of Decred - a collaborative spirit that is very hard to come by in other projects. \n\nI've seen mention in other comments in response to this post that 'we should focus on what really matters'. \n\nThe truth is, there are very few things that anyone can say for sure, truly matter because it depends on your perspective. \n\nPrice is for most an easy measure of network performance but it is certainly not a good measure of technical competence. However history is littered with projects that were technologically superior but that lost out to those that had a better go to market strategy, surprising use case or that simply hit some particular cultural nerve. \n\nFor me the value of the Decred research and RR's contribution is three fold.  \n\n**The past**\n- Crypto Commons and other recent research and analysis tells us where we've come from. It might be an obvious point but without context, there is no red thread to help us understand just where we might be right now or where we could be headed. For many crypto OGs this historical context is well understood, but for me this was the first time I’d really read about the origins of OSS and the values contained therein. More please. \n\n**The present** \n- This plays more to the on chain research - but wider to encompass a wide range of metrics - both currently measured and those yet to be analysed or tracked. I don't claim to understand much of the more technical analysis but I believe that this area is also somewhere that Decred can differentiate simply by being the most trusted and transparent outfit project out there - constantly questioning orthodox thought and confirmation bias.  \n\n- What are the right metrics to analyse? What are other projects measuring themselves against? Is coin market cap a flawed idea, or does it just not capture the important value created by decentralised networks? What might Decred measure itself against that is a true differentiator and how might that research be communicated? For example the number of contractors? Perhaps 'what should we measure' should be a discussion point or research project in itself?  \n\n**The future** \n\n- Perhaps this sits better with some of Haon and Amarrooni's writing but certainly RR included a certain amount of educated speculation in Crypto Commons as to where we are headed. Naturally his work is more academic in nature and therefore more empirically focussed, but I would like to see a few more dots being joined when it comes to articulating imaginative use cases for the Decred stack. I believe that is why collaboration between contractors is so important. \n\nThere's a quote I read a while back:\n\n\u003e  trust is the bridge that connects the known to the unknown \n\nThis is I believe why this area of work, bridging the past, present and future is so valuable, because it builds trust and trust is the most powerful thing in the world. Decred’s funded research of independent contractors (and Crypto Commons specifically) isn’t marketing, nor is it something that is a ‘nice to have’ or should it be marked as ‘sponsored’. \n\nIt is an essential, higher order, open source technology product of the emerging Decred stack that helps us understand what was, what is and what might be. \n\nIn the future I would love to see the research products used as source material and inspiration for even more accessible (and even entertaining) set of higher order materials. \n\nWe are seeing this kind of thinking appear in the recent launch of Nakamoto launched by some of the biggest names in crypto. \n\n\u003e “Nakamoto is a journal of technology, philosophy, and culture”.\n\nSenior contributors write pro bono \"because they want to help build a journal with our values.” whilst less established contributors receive bitcoin, depending on the article and how lengthy and complex it is.\n\nI believe Decred’s existing research team and the evolution of the contractor model offers an opportunity to achieve something that Nakamoto can’t - despite, or perhaps because of the big names involved. \n\n- Editorial independence\n- Collective intelligence\n- Sustainable open source funding that enables content to remain free and accessible to all. \n\nIt is easy to chase culture through clicks and impressions. It is very hard to create culture, but that’s for another day. \n","signature":"bb54434c64f7c047ac91add5ed717f6414958ab52f7bfe7f431688d13afff017c48908508c0a1bcc47efd74fdbd0d5be84941bd5a665214fa428d2d8d57f1e0e","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"16","receipt":"77ddf97186675a2eec6db5dd3aeb4128f1c2c330f28d612d42c2f7f0c42c4918910dd738ee0dddbce1a369b2b76e2fde2291d91227fe653d04e1bfdbc9ead406","timestamp":1579175819,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
