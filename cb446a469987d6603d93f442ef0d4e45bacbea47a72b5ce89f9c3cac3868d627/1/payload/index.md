Incentivizing BD Evangelists within the Decred Ecosystem

**Background:**

As a project, Decred has been praised for its vision, governance model, developer team, network security, and decentralization.  However, there have been criticisms that the project lacks near-term practical use cases (eg. comments by Coinbase representative at Decred developer event at Coinbase HQ in SF;  comments by Placeholder VC representative at OKCoin-hosted event in SF; analysis by CryptoBriefing).   

Without near-term practical use cases, it is not clear where adoption will come from. As experienced technologists, we know that building technology in a vacuum without requirements from real-world users is rarely a recipe for success.

In order to prove the critics wrong, Decred needs a “big use case” that can revolutionize the real world and drive early user adoption.

**Gap in the Decred Ecosystem:**

In order to find use cases and early users, most centralized technology companies have a so-called “BD Team” to build the business case for platform; attract partners, users, and build momentum; and to define technical and business requirements for the engineering and product teams based on studying the behaviors and gathering the feedback of users.  

Typically for a project at Decred's stage in the old centralized world, it would be possible to do “BD Deals” in the size range of $1m to $10m per contract if a team is effective in finding appropriate co-development partners with a suitable problem that the platform can solve with a bit more co-development towards the partners value-added requirements.

Unfortunately, Decred lacks a BD team or mandate to do co-development style of deals, and therefore, it is unable to gain ever-so important requirements from early, forward-looking partners who might be interested to fund building-out of the vision if/as goals are co-aligned.

**Personal Enthusiasm:**

Personally, as a huge Decred fan, I would love to be able to try and “bring a deal to the table” via my friends and contacts in major organizations.   For example, I’d love to spend a week pitching Decred co-development ideas at Apple, Google, Government of Alberta, World Bank, etc. where I have personal relationships at senior levels.

However, at present, I am not incentivized to do so, and I don’t have a process to follow to introduce such an opportunity to a partner or back to the Decred ecosystem.

Probably there are lots of other Decred fans like me with great relationship and BD skills, who would love to bring an opportunity to the stakeholder community that could create value for the ecosystem, and real-world problems and requirements for the developer community to sink their teeth in to.

**Proposal:**

As a proposal to fix the fact that the Decred lacks a mechanism to fund top BD people who might be excited by the mission and vision of the project and also willing to allocate some time to working on it, I would like to propose the following:

•	We create a new class of participant in the Decred Ecosystem called “Decred Evangelist”,
•	Individuals who would like to become a Decred Evangelist submit their identity and resume to the Decred Community to be approved in a rolling vote held every three-months,
•	Once approved by a majority of the community, Decred Evangelists can represent the project and solicit business partnerships on behalf of the ecosystem,
•	A Decred Evangelist role is valid for 12 calendar months, and upon expiry must be renewed,

_(1) Decred Evangelists would be focused on the following goals:_

•	Finding major governments, corporates, or technology companies that would like to partner with Decred to scope a project and co-develop it on top of Decred's decentralized infrastructure,
•	Definining the scope of the co-development project, the specific usage of Decred’s technology, the specific technical requirements to be delivered by the project, and the developer skills and effort required, 
•	Negotiating a pledge of a one-time lump sum payment and/or an ongoing royalty or license-fee stream to be paid by the partner to the Decred Treasury,
•	Specifying any additional funding needed from the Decred treasury in order to cement the financial contribution of the co-development partner,

_(2) Decred Evangelists would post fully worked-up proposals to the stakeholder community on Politeia including the following information:_

•	Name of project partner, e.g. Apple
•	Scope of project, e.g. Create an iOS App to enable Voter Elibibility Verification and Voting in a State Election in California leveraging Decred’s blockchain and infrastructure
•	Specific technical requirements, i.e. 5-10 page document would define user stories & requirements
•	Funds required from the Treasury, e.g. $250,000
•	One-time match funding to be provided by the partner, e.g. $5,000,000
•	Royalty or license fee to be provided by the partner, e.g. usd$1,000,000 equivalent of DCR purchased by the partner on the open market and gifted back to the Treasury annually for 5-years, assuming adoption and recurring use by State of California

_(3) Decred Evangelists would be rewarded according to the following scheme:_

•	For projects approved by the majority of the Decred community that go into production, the Decred Evangelist would be paid ten-percent of any upfront fees and/or any long-term royalties or license fees paid by the co-development partner into the Treasury.  This fee is a little bit higher than the commission fee based compensation that a skilled BD executive at Oracle or IBM would make, to account for lack of monthly salary and also to account for the fact that Decred is still pretty new and therefore getting major BD deals done will be a labor of love.  

**Benefit of the Proposal to Decred Ecosystem:**

By supporting this proposal, Decred community stakeholders can equip the Decred ecosystem with a mechanism to attract skilled BD executives to develop relationships with major ecosystem co-development partners, and to gather additional funding for the project from these partners, as well as to define real-world requirements for Decred contractors, in order to accelerate the pace of build-out of the protocol and software tools within the Decred ecosystem.
