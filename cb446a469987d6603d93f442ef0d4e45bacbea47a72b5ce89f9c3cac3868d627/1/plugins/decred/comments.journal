I am reticent to back this proposal without a massive change of directions or complete abandonment and re-write. \n\nThis proposal is potentially an end around the current contractor model we already have in place (not that I think that's the intention), it could damage a lot of the progress and positive cultural value that has been derived from it, and also curtail additional value we would surely gain from protecting the integrity of the contractor model in place.\n\nI think Decred could be exposed to adverse selection, while we may find quality people, we will still have no experiential knowledge of their long term dedication to Decred until some point into the 12 months process.\n\nIn addition we will have committed to some evangelists that we discover are not the \"right fit\".well before the 12 months is up, but we are still beholden to through the end of the 12 month term?\n\nTo a large extent I already see every contractor at Decred and many more community participants as evangelists.  I'm sure a great majority own DCR, and already have ample incentive to fulfill a majority of the functions you outline above. \n\nDecred may be better off just stoking our community members that have already shown alignment and skin in the game to enhance this evangelist mandate that many already hold.\n\nLastly, the proposed path could undercut and disincentivize our aforementioned contractors that are already compensated and reflexively fulfilling the role of evangelists.\n\nWhile I characterize the above statements as hard opinion, I hope said statements  will also be seen a questions that you are open to responding to.  Looking forward to the debate around this as I hope to learn a lot and end up in a more enlightened position as a result of the discourse that ensues.","signature":"c27f03458a219cc9062e99cf177e6cff63bfbf646287f6dce7e3d2bd81d105820a595502f8e4f521c7ff185f07567cef2af3e0485588d9f3680ee2c9a20ad60e","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"1","receipt":"d6bb6844d9d3e1da24a3752081980201f2299ddbcf2d9061cad3c78edea05f2c42ffb8f430c5f9e3fa2315b5d83bcdf5f18bdcf17ef6f209e8d74d60736f1f0a","timestamp":1559054086,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
