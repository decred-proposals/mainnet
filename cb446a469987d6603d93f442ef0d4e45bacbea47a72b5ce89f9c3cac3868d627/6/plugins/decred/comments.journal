I am reticent to back this proposal without a massive change of directions or complete abandonment and re-write. \n\nThis proposal is potentially an end around the current contractor model we already have in place (not that I think that's the intention), it could damage a lot of the progress and positive cultural value that has been derived from it, and also curtail additional value we would surely gain from protecting the integrity of the contractor model in place.\n\nI think Decred could be exposed to adverse selection, while we may find quality people, we will still have no experiential knowledge of their long term dedication to Decred until some point into the 12 months process.\n\nIn addition we will have committed to some evangelists that we discover are not the \"right fit\".well before the 12 months is up, but we are still beholden to through the end of the 12 month term?\n\nTo a large extent I already see every contractor at Decred and many more community participants as evangelists.  I'm sure a great majority own DCR, and already have ample incentive to fulfill a majority of the functions you outline above. \n\nDecred may be better off just stoking our community members that have already shown alignment and skin in the game to enhance this evangelist mandate that many already hold.\n\nLastly, the proposed path could undercut and disincentivize our aforementioned contractors that are already compensated and reflexively fulfilling the role of evangelists.\n\nWhile I characterize the above statements as hard opinion, I hope said statements  will also be seen a questions that you are open to responding to.  Looking forward to the debate around this as I hope to learn a lot and end up in a more enlightened position as a result of the discourse that ensues.","signature":"c27f03458a219cc9062e99cf177e6cff63bfbf646287f6dce7e3d2bd81d105820a595502f8e4f521c7ff185f07567cef2af3e0485588d9f3680ee2c9a20ad60e","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"1","receipt":"d6bb6844d9d3e1da24a3752081980201f2299ddbcf2d9061cad3c78edea05f2c42ffb8f430c5f9e3fa2315b5d83bcdf5f18bdcf17ef6f209e8d74d60736f1f0a","timestamp":1559054086,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Definitely, I felt some of the same tensions when I put on my community member hat to review my own proposal.  \n\nThanks for giving me a chance to explain my thought processes in arriving at this particular framing, and I look forward to the dialogue that unfolds. \n\nI am a big believer that through dialogue we can sharpen our ideas, planning, and execution.\n\nLet me start by saying, I have zero pride in the ideas put forward, and my singular goal is in driving towards the success of the Decred 'digital sovereign' economy.\n\nIn an earlier draft of the proposal, I had tried to make the selection of the BD evangelists something that would happen based on a rolling 3-month community vote based process, but then, just before agreeing to let the proposal go live, I changed the mechanism to a more traditional method of hiring and firing, for fear that the rolling-vote just wouldn’t be pragmatic, for three reasons, (1) I wouldn’t be able to design a mechanism to administer the rolling vote, (2) if I tried to it would be a distraction to the real goal of getting deals done for Decred with a sense of urgency as this entire space is heating up and Decred community members want to put points on the board, and (3) I wanted to ensure adherence to some deep beliefs that I’ve learned thru practical experience building BD teams.   \n\nAs context, in the organizations I've built to date in my career I've hired ~ 400 people, and let-go ~ 100 of them, and about 40 of these people have been BD focused, so I have some experience with how difficult it is to build and manage high-performance teams, including BD teams, and have a lot of scars, successes, and some deep beliefs anchored in these years of learnings. \n\nSince I am personally aligned with Decred's future with my time and resources at a significant and meaningful level of commitment, I got started with the proposal process with an ‘owner’s mentality’ wanting to make Decred successful to maximum possible extent in short-, medium-, and long-term.  \n\nThus, I wanted to put forward a model where I can bring to the table the best of what I've learned thru my personal experiences building high-performance BD teams to commercialize new technology, which includes three key lessons after many years of trial-and-error learning: \n\n(a) BD specialists compensation should be primarily performance-based since most of the time they fail to deliver anything of any use (i.e. they should 'eat what they kill'), \n\n(b) by aligning interests of a dozen BD specialists with relationship access to different organizations and industries we can run lots of BD pitches and experiments in parallel to learn by trial-and-error where the \"spaghetti sticks to the wall\", i.e. where we have \"product market fit\", and \n\n(c) we want to establish a culture whereby BD specialists who are not putting their heart and soul into winning results are quickly released to pursue other passions w/ an open, direct, positive, and encouraging exit-interview.\n\nRe this last point, we call this 'hatch and release' in the tech company I lead today, which I believe is a term coined at Genentech where ruthlessness in 'hatch and release' has been attributed to the strength and success of the Genentech's current team and culture by some of the long-time veterans there.  (Generally, 'hatch and release' within 30 days would be a great model to follow for the entire Decred contractor community, imho, whether we are talking about BD contractors or otherwise.)\n\nDefinitely, aspirationally, as I said above, I had initially and instinctively wanted to try and make the selection and release of the contractors community-based, to be more consistent with Decred community values, with some kind of rolling vote process.  However, from an implementation standpoint, I didn't know how to quickly or effectively implement the \"hatch and release\" idea, which really is done through personal relationships, and requires the assessment of many human factors, i.e. effort, punctuality, body language, communication, etc., and also requires seeing whites-of-eyeballs and hearing tone of voice when discussing client relationships, closing likelihoods, ‘knock backs’, lessons learned, etc.  I really, genuinely honestly don’t know how the entire Decred community can be involved in such a process of managing if/when ‘hatch \u0026 release’ needs to happen, at least not in a way that is efficient.\n\nAs a separate item, I don't understand enough about how the current contractor platform works to know if I could build on the infra in some way to accomplish some or all of my intended result.  If someone has suggestions for how to accomplish the three intended principles (including, especially, 'hatch and release') in a way that is more consistent with the Decred contractor management system and norms that we have today, I am super open-minded about re-working the entire proposal.  Again, I have zero pride, and I'm only trying to help Decred succeed.  \n\nThat being said, I would prefer not to relax on adhering to any of these three principles stated above, as, for me, keeping to these three key principles are what I know from my empirical experience can bring about success in commercializing new technology and exploring many major industries and prospective partnerships to find product market fit quickly \u0026 at lowest cost.\n\nSo, to my thought process, since I didn't know how to accomplish these three principles using the current contractor model, basically, in a spirit of pragmatism, I defaulted to asking the Decred community to \"trust me\" in administering a BD program through personal relationships, with my reputation as a contractor on the line in delivering it, and with the 'centralized trust' that the Decred community would bestow upon me to run a small team limited to a 1-year experimental program.  \n\nBasically, this procurement model that I'm suggesting Decred follow to retain my services is similar to how a government grants a concession to a contractor to operate a metro or airport for a fixed period of time, or to protect the green zone in a war torn country, etc. etc.\n\nRe my thinking about a 1-year term, that was based on the insight that the enterprise sales cycle is typically 6-months to 18-months, and recruiting BD specialists (many of whom are busy, successful people w/ day jobs), educating them on Decred, getting pitch materials prepared, making pitches, gathering feedback, tweaking pitches, discussing pricing, going to exec level, drafting proposals to the Treasury, etc. is going to require a year or so to programmatically bear fruit.  Probably 18-months would be safer, but, I proposed 1-year as I thought it would be the minimum responsible time to seeing indications of progress.\n\nIn the spirit of pragmatism, since the BD evangelists would not actually be paid by Decred directly, but instead are earning a % of ‘match funds’ that they bring to the Treasury from external customer organizations, the cash outlay from the Decred Treasury to the BD specialists would be zero, and the risk-return proposition to the community of the proposal would be very good.\n\nI should note, the process I would follow in recruiting BD contractors would emphasize aligning experienced BD specialists (some of whom will be employed at major top 20 tech companies) who have existing relationships where they have sold technology before and have helped their customers be successful.  If we can make pitches thru their existing relationships, without wasting a lot of time needing to develop and nurture new sales leads, we can short-circuit the regular sales cycle and process of forming personal trust with sales leads to a certain extent.","signature":"d5cbfa5116cde888e6d2ad820897bc1cb15b50fdd1f2ae7dc2874c0cdb98826199be83f84413da87f8b7b9078112f2920411de9d2f9af6799332770442949507","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"3","receipt":"a7a8902bada194d2b259ebee4c1ee034be43a8eb133c59875111ec2de4a5f13e3bc6cee50d6fe8091cf4901a0cc0efe97b6debe7d73bb850021284314a38550e","timestamp":1559114190,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Hypothetically, Decred can procure work at level of individual human beings for specific tasks (like the Epstein proposal in voting now); teams of many people for projects that might contain hundreds of tasks (such as this proposal, here), or entire organizations with hundreds of people for major programs that might contain many sub-projects  and thousands of tasks.    (probably the latter option to procure entire programs would be impossible at current price of DCR , but, if together we can grow this economy to $10B market cap... and the Treasury has a billion to allocate, could we get there?). From what I’ve read online, I believe that the Decred founders wanted to have an ability to procure \"entire teams\", with experienced managers coordinating these teams towards the accomplishment of larger goals that the community might prioritize accomplishing.  If this is truly the intention, then perhaps community members can view the present proposal not as circumventing the \"single human-being contractor hiring system\", but instead as a complementary mechanism to procuring performance-oriented teams.\n\n+++\n\nIn summary, as a new prospective contractor, it would be helpful for me to understand answers to the following questions so that I can think about re-working the proposal once all of the feedback has been collected:\n\n(1) Scope of Contracts Awarded.  Does the Decred community have a view on what is the \"most efficient unit of procurement\"?  Is hiring high-performance “teams” a priority?\n\n(2) Decred Contractor Management System.  Are there any ways that we might utilize the contractor management system in the proposal that I've put forward here, and also adhere to the three principles of running a successful BD organization that I've also outlined, above?\n\n(3) Community Norms and Processes. Are there any suggestions on how I might re-work the proposal in a way that would be more consistent with community norms and processes established to date?","signature":"267cc61773d902831d25ae308e80f639130f0d4ae8763cea742d027cb6909b12563fb5b187f797ee507731d30ede9814c2fb5b0480f881bd394695ac2d590503","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"4","receipt":"0aad7edf0c5aa1ed72bfe3c96daf465cd18eaecf1ef213c4d1dbd60920b678b0f03cec28424a288da88540ea976666dd3d733e9be814718b31dba4a8473ace0e","timestamp":1559114531,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My thinking was that this hybrid model could empower anyone within the community to apply to become a BD Evangelist on the team, including especially existing contractors who have shown loyalty, commitment, etc.   Probably my intuition to balance these two goals of _high-performance team_ with _open-access to apply to join _wasn't immediately obvious. \n\n -- As a thought experiment, how do you think you would react if I re-wrote the proposal to offer an experienced Silicon Valley BD team, i.e., 5 to 7 individuals with current or recent day jobs at Apple, Bosch, Cisco, Google, Oracle, Symantec, VMWare, etc. The goal of this fit-for-purpose BD team would be to explore if there is a market opportunity to sell Decred infrastructure to large tech companies and enterprises who might be compelled to build on top of this infrastructure, but might need to pay a contractor within the ecosystem to build an adapter, App, extension.  In addition to coordinating such a team, and getting the team up the learning curve and pitching to targets, and quickly doing \"hatch and release\" with team non-performing team members, we would also seek to involve the subset of community members who applied to join the team in an inclusive way.\n\n -- Re the philosophical question of \"optimal unit of procurement for Decred\", I believe that for the next 18 months or so while Decred sits in the $250m to $2.5b scale the optimal procurement model is to hire single \"high-performance teams\" with very specific goals and objectives set forth in each proposal contract, and then cutting the team off from future contracts if they don't meet or beat expectations.  Such a team would typically comprise 1 team lead,  3-15 team members, and a 3-12 month scope of work.  I could explain my rationale if anyone was interested, but, I'm going to try and keep this post a bit shorter, so will end here for tonight. :-)","signature":"9bbd33eaf918fbdbe85da3c63e87f4af662479bb0adb905b30927731a4e35538b668960a216dd3944bcc3fda4277e9d1b8d418b4581ddafd9b94d3ace990460b","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"6","receipt":"c01c55061ce30b516149c6b80e5db1401b00584584f116955e1829be1cd9a5d73de071dfd198e0967c39c5ac7cc70d6d8d9bcba8b43b557816f818ae16ba2b0e","timestamp":1559187689,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

At first glance, I must say that I see a few major technical issues that could make difficult to get any benefit from the efforts of eventual BD evangelists.\n\nBut before that, I have to assume that this proposal would genuinely bring valuable contributions to Decred and that associations or agreements would be productive partnerships. I'm sad to say that I know very few of these partnerships in the CC space that consist of more than : \"We use your big corp name for marketing and hype, and in exchange you use \"blockchain\" and other nice keywords so you appear to be up to date with what's popular in the media\".\n\nSo let's say we do have valuable partnership opportunities, the first problem I see is which legal entity from Decred can sign such partnership or agreement? In the decentralized world we are building, there is no central or legal entity that can take that role. Giving that role to an \"elected\" representative would be voting for centralization, and having contractors take that role, could expose them to legal obligations they have no way of enforcing because they do not control Decred and What stakeholders decide.\n\nThen, there is the problem of who can provide the work (dev, support, etc) from the Decred side, to meet the requirements of such partnership? Our current model doesn't allow stakeholders to dictate what contractors do, or if they want to work on X or Y. The model has been described for a while as \"bring your own devs\",  so that proposals must include all steps and provide the actual means for its completion.  In the case that an evangelist were to strike a big deal, it would be impossible to assign any new task to the current dev workforce, and probably dangerous to burden individuals who may or may not be interested in that work. Otherwise, if the tasks rely only on the partnered business, there's no need for a partnership in the first place.\n\n\nI do however agree that there's a place for BD around Decred. In some way, anyone already has the legitimacy to act as an \"evangelist\" or to approach potential businesses. I see partnerships and agreements more as complete proposals that stakeholders could vote on. For example, someone could envision time-stamping youtube videos, gather a small team of devs, and leverage contacts at Google, to write up a joint proposal for it.\n\nIf you're familiar with the \"Building on Bitcoin\" initiative and events,  I believe this \"model\" makes a lot more sense to bring businesses around a cryptocurrency like Decred.  And we do have many unique traits that makes \"Building on Decred\" really attractive,  from getting paid for contributions, to leveraging the whole open-source ecosystem like politeia, dcrtime, CMS, lightning network, etc... and our vibrant community of devs, stakeholders and enthusiasts.","signature":"6ce15c876f6d8311d85b2a67b7e50279f58050a2e0053fe496cc1f7344026fb49d10227fbe0c8cd9cb3043d599fba0108f1acfbe062e1d27cb326d076029930a","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"7","receipt":"ede1e85c5c32cdbac0d93b945e38f5cb4ce3f5cf005bb4384492108fedc7dbfdb934436c2743517ed65ee4fec1c57792d84cd21e01b049db1016b515cb5cff02","timestamp":1559264970,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

That needs to be explored, but, lets assume for a moment it is a viable idea.\n\nNow, to the question of \"who at Decred signs the agreement?\"  Here is the proposed solution that I have in mind:  An enterprise co-development partner can announce its pledge to a decentralized project like Decred by having one of its officers prepare a public letter explaining the purpose of their \"earmarked contribution to the Treasury\" and then posting this letter to a public forum such as Reddit.  This is similar to how donors pledge funds to Universities, who, for reasons of not wanting to lose their \"not for profit status\" cannot enter into normal bilateral contractual agreements promising deliverables.  This happens all the time at Stanford and MIT, with major corporate donors making pledges to University industry affiliate programs vis-a-vis making monetary pledges via hand-signed, PDF'd, and emailed letters and following through on a voluntary basis with a wire transfer.  Since it is a public-spirited commitment, social enforcement mechanisms seem to be sufficient, and a donor who welches will be looked down upon within the social circles of the University, and will in effect become ostracized, excluded, and cut-off from the community.  Decred is creating the same \"social community\" within which social enforcement, as opposed to strict legal enforcement, can work well.\n\nI really like the YouTube time-stamping example.  I have a friend who works in that part of Google, and I can chat with him about it.\n\nRe the question of who does the development work?  Maybe an answer is that any proposal that would create developer load must also come with a staffing plan for who would perform the work, or else the community won't take the proposal seriously, and won't approve it?  As the community grows, hopefully we can see more contractor teams getting up to speed and bringing capacity to the ecosystem.  Is that satisfactory?\n\n+++\n\nThank you for these excellent comments - I shall take them all into account as I undertake v2, which will also address @notrunner's feedback, and should be ready shortly.","signature":"e0d68097df5ce1b80485190be54312d8a916bf7008986767899d15b3f353c87da4e4395a9bd294b1328ef67cd21f68e55a0d78384c0724776728d9dce615870a","publickey":"dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","commentid":"8","receipt":"a2f257e20d02f5815ac39da725557acab6f751ed5d83544730b1b0b695004ffcee8aeaa68ba031dd767417dfc771886a235325d1ecb1aeb5994e399383329f0e","timestamp":1559268496,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
