Hopefully this will help other stakeholders to see the value.\n\n[Market making](https://blockcommons.red/publication/mm-phase1-wrapup/):\n\n- monitored and analyzed order book depth to verify the quality of paid market making service\n- \"liquidity begets liquidity\" hypothesis was tested and no indication of organic liquidity growth was found within 5 months of observation, while there might have been some growth in trading volume\n\nChain analysis [part 1](https://blog.decred.org/2020/06/08/Decred-blockchain-analysis-Part-1/):\n\n- 465K of the 840K founders premine and 290K of the 840K airdrop were untouched\n- 95% DCR in circulation is in addresses with balances of \u003e100 DCR\n- top 100 addresses control 30% of circulating supply (excluding Treasury)\n- ~34% of the 345K DCR paid by the Treasury to contractors was not spent, ~24% was staked, ~24% ended up in a known exchange address, ~2% was mixed - tells me that after all the troubles of working for DCR contractors still accumulate it when they can\n- out of ~5.8M DCR PoW rewards, 60% ended up on addresses associated with exchanges and 10% has been staked - hopefully puts an end to the \"contractors selling pressure\" claims because ~3.4M DCR sold is obviously greater than ~80K\n\nPoliteia's [second year](https://blockcommons.red/publication/politeia-at-2/):\n\n- 3 proposals failed to reach quorum (didn't happen in year 1)\n- average turnout was down ~3% from year 1 (to 27.9%)\n- average approval for passed proposals was 79%, down from 86% in year 1\n- there were more marketing proposals than in year 1\n- 48% of proposals came from contractors (up from 35% in year 1), and these were again more likely to pass\n- 10 of second year's proposals were renewals, and these had an 80% success rate\n\nMy biggest takeaway from the [second](https://blockcommons.red/post/dcr-on-chain-2/) chain analysis report and this proposal, is that a single researcher with a small budget can get pretty far in clustering identities and following the coins, showing just how important it is to develop privacy (and by extension, fungibility) protections. Further research will provide good materials to promote privacy, and we need to increase stakeholder privacy to protect overall network security.\n\nAnother thing this has shown is that a lot of mined coins are flowing to a handful of centralized exchanges. I would like to learn more about these flows and to have someone keep an eye on it, because in theory miners and exchanges can conspire and do bad things (esp. when amplified by evil devices like fractional reserve and margin trading).\n\nI haven't looked into crypto governance research pages yet, but I know that when I need it, I will quickly learn the important bits of other projects' governance systems without digging through diverse documentation. In the bigger picture, [Crypto Commons](https://blockcommons.red/post/ppcc-changelog-2020/) looks like a good map to navigate the exploding space of crypto governance, funding, and commons-based peer production, from which we borrow the best solutions to Decred.","signature":"5a3eff6adba3fa5ba3077f1b888a249b1e4b887fdba09686c4ef7a5d76d78ba83a0f7f6022b4bb66eff82c1eb4d47789ac362563546f7532dc3da2756c64aa02","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"1","receipt":"5b0ab87fbe8fb5cadcba3fc060acf1ca93f87d6628644f344abfc5e2c62e4a9d217acd979ee1f9069ea14312f3163cf008508cfa65153c2d8941d54ee9f04700","timestamp":1612301394,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Bee; but I have some questions which I pose in hopes they clarify things for me, and perhaps they can even be constructive for the future (potential) edits of the Proposal. \n\n1) Do you think it's necessary for DCR to invest in non-DCR research?  Up to $10k, why do you think it is beneficial for DCR to fund research not related directly to DCR? Any examples you can provide of how this has been beneficial?\n\n2) The onchain stats stuff is also being researched by others, isn't funding many onchain researchers at once redundant? \n\n3) What is the role of the paragraph on \"Fun stuff\"? The clay animations etc you didn't bill for, as you say  (imo you didn't even need to state that btw, I doubt anybody assumed you billed for it).

The budget for the proposal seems commensurate with the hours and skills necessary for this kind of work, especially since I know it is not easy to do.  On the other hand, I'm struggling to see how this type of ongoing chain analysis research is worth paying for by the stakeholders.  I might be open to funding other specific areas of chain research but, for me personally, the ones listed above are not very interesting.  For example, if a privacy export or team wanted to investigate how on-chain privacy and lightning should interact with each other then I would be open to that.\n\nBee's Decred data tracking initiative I see differently.  The data tracking is a lot easier for me to see how it would directly benefit stakeholders plus the cost is a lot lower.\nIt's not up to me but I would like to see this split into two proposals.","signature":"3b8a186fd67824d00b6e3da27d82752a071a5fdd7792c0506c241f733375f0d11b4dbdef62f99d72cd5abca9ade746512d3353d16fcaaba86a049d162ad67f0f","publickey":"ce0dd858e52efcd88ba7e49dbd88d846d642c7b0b261a325ae327dc6b5ff6ccc","commentid":"16","receipt":"ea80a3c61d008263c03de5adef0eee23d04de74ba7913523fdc90764076949a7229f48727ce44f849f65eb4df349f24d80d13acb16efd0cf44c2514f49267e03","timestamp":1612726551,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

From organizational perspective I would like to practice multi-person projects more. This way we will have the DAO decentralized \"at the top\" (having the ultimate power), but it will hire a bunch of semi-centralized structures that are more efficient compared to a swarm of solo people.\n\nBut this is my view ofc. If more people feel these should be split please comment. Also, should something go wrong with the group prop I will likely try my part again separately.","signature":"d817ad16d64ca0a3b98a6879e0102d617905f8166705f5d1acfb12d579e945db733a2bee47768c5466e1ca738c3be62c65fe6502f68358c091e67ccd4009dc00","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"17","receipt":"1390d51b844afe46415e9337acac6f9e6370ff1c55af9cae3b6ce5ca864164bbe14eec9bd6b4b22424b399d5e7d517e19788061d0d073280845dd7af9d3ed00c","timestamp":1612744546,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
