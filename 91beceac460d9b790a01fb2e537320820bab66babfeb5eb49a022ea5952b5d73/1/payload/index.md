RFP: Change the messaging on decred.org

This proposal is about opening an RFP process to approve changes to the messaging on the main decred.org website. Myself, @checkmate and @jy-p have been discussing some perceived issues with the current messaging (highlight that DCR is money, add "Fairness" as an additional aspect of Decred, see below). As this is a prominent site which has a lot of power to influence perception of Decred, we felt it should be put to a stakeholder vote. Now that we have the RFP process we can open this decision up for alternative proposals to also be considered. This should also make for a good test of the RFP process.

## Why change the site's copy?

The site's current copy highlights some of Decred's strengths, but it doesn't put Decred's function as a system of money in focus. 

The main tagline of "Community-Directed, Superior Store of Value" could be quite difficult for people who are not familiar with the SoV jargon to understand, and might fail to resonate with people generally.

The site's most prominent messaging also currently does not give much sense of the project's broader purpose or motivation, it is quite focused on the DCR asset.

Finally, the copy we are proposing uses the term "Decentralized Credits" more prominently, in an effort to further clarify what Decred is about.

## How much would it cost?

The costs will depend on how far-reaching the proposed changes are. There are several types of cost that can be anticipated:

* Translations: The text is available in 12 languages, so any changes will have to be translated to 11 other languages.
* Graphical elements: Proposals that involve adding new pages or sections, or making significant changes to the subject matter of existing pages, should consider whether new graphics will be required to maintain a consistent structure on the site.
* Structural elements: Proposals that involve any deviation from the current structure would involve some costs to make those changes to the site's code.

## The RFP process

For this first proposal the vote will be about whether to proceed with the RFP process. The RFP proposals require a deadline for submissions at the outset, I have selected September 25 because I think the RFP can move quite quickly to voting.

A valid submission should :

* Propose a coherent set of changes to the site's copy, which is conveniently all located in one [file](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/blob/master/transifex_catalogs/en.json).
* Summarize the additional work which would be required to support the deployment of these changes.

We are setting a budget limit of $5,000 for these proposals. The website was recently redesigned at some cost, so we think it is best to keep the scope of changes fairly limited.

When the submissions deadline passes, stakeholders would vote to decide which of the options they want to adopt (if any).

Our proposal ("Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money for a Fairer Financial System") can be considered as an [example](https://gist.github.com/RichardRed0x/22c584e7fd9413c1a3f3284069998892) of the kind of proposals we're expecting.
