We use the term \"Credits\" here in the sense of \"An arbitrary unit of value\" (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/credit#Noun). However, in common usage (perhaps more so in the US), \"credit\" more commonly carries the idea of a delayed payment (i.e. credit card, buying on credit, creditworthiness). It is my concern that if we feature \"Decentralized Credits\" too prominently, it may be a source of confusion leading people to believe that Decred is some kind of cryptocurrency lending/borrowing platform.\n\nJust my two atoms; other than that, in favor of clarifying our messaging as outlined in this proposal.","signature":"67a184314eaba667b5e03ceec73542eb3aba99c3c2cf88895e37536cde6e2657af90fb3d0ec90f3f2f885a7153ea7cd244b056ecf47be52c182060503ed96901","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"1","receipt":"5bc85830ae5e2cf31403f50919c23d2c7512494a76a5cf4a01b5d943534dc8ad3c2474f727556eed71272205bc30364a5df53489e0e884bda5379100dbd21104","timestamp":1599684166,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It also capitalises on differentiation and is tangible enough for both retail and institutional eyes.\n\nSound Money --\u003e Soundness is actually unique in cc core messaging and few projects can viably 'lift' it as we have seen unfortunately in the past. Money that is sound and governed by stakeholders leans into the analogy Ammar has brought to light with the similarity with the Special Drawing RIghts (SDR) currency. This is an important framework in my opinion especially for the institutional appeal.\n\nFairer Financial System --\u003e All the above + Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable are pushing for the ultimate goal of building a fairer financial system. From the currency to the applications, this is what Decred is building and it is important to set it up front and centre. This is a message people of all backgrounds can rally behind and it could not be more precient.\n\nWhat = Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money\nWhy = Create a Fairer Financial System\nHow = By being Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable.\n\nAll in all, I believe this core messaging distinguishes a clear place and objective for Decred as a better solution for the insane world that is coming.","signature":"5d4c94b749ae2bda18552c7ab2e827f364ad35ec3352778d7077e9ea74a684f643b9ce37ef98ecbcac7c0d47b1504ca85c954368b73aed4e554f26f79d405000","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"2","receipt":"2da8d284d97386c65f01100f57c166a1952e44949be40fecca5b700715f274dc2fc732f0b6831a7c350be6d7d7c242a51581f0f3076114c544b880e1b40eeb0d","timestamp":1599695145,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think the \"s\" to make it plural breaks that association, when I think of \"credits\" the association is to sci-fi and arcade machines. That probably doesn't translate well though, so perhaps we need a different word for the non-English copy.\n\nThe other side of it is that we're already somewhat committed to \"credits\" because otherwise \"Decred\" doesn't have much meaning. We've got the \"cred\" in the name already, which is possibly more likely to be associated with credit than \"credits\", so in my view using \"credits\" more is helping to address that.","signature":"a71d352034c34ec012b708fc8f308b22627e95040d3c37ae31dac9a493efaff385fb8e787ebf9e1f7b2e0806828c599fda008d3fc1f18bd5540f64605cfacb04","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"6821d76303530bcb606e369b20a0ca3d997a699a5982c7c12bd97a4b2db000da1c8b877933ccea814eac5b0b3d023e5e2aab3e8f86db3f081733dcbbe44ee502","timestamp":1599764283,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
