We use the term \"Credits\" here in the sense of \"An arbitrary unit of value\" (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/credit#Noun). However, in common usage (perhaps more so in the US), \"credit\" more commonly carries the idea of a delayed payment (i.e. credit card, buying on credit, creditworthiness). It is my concern that if we feature \"Decentralized Credits\" too prominently, it may be a source of confusion leading people to believe that Decred is some kind of cryptocurrency lending/borrowing platform.\n\nJust my two atoms; other than that, in favor of clarifying our messaging as outlined in this proposal.","signature":"67a184314eaba667b5e03ceec73542eb3aba99c3c2cf88895e37536cde6e2657af90fb3d0ec90f3f2f885a7153ea7cd244b056ecf47be52c182060503ed96901","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"1","receipt":"5bc85830ae5e2cf31403f50919c23d2c7512494a76a5cf4a01b5d943534dc8ad3c2474f727556eed71272205bc30364a5df53489e0e884bda5379100dbd21104","timestamp":1599684166,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
