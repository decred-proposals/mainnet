Design domain budgets: 08.20 - 02.21

# **Why?**

This proposal intends to formalize the design domain spending for the current core contractors and on-going work. DCR stakeholders authorize a budget and general work plans described below, where-as the design contractors continue to work autonomously within the approved higher-level parameters.

Work specific details, among complete deliverables, are archived in the [gh/dcrdesign](http://github.com/decred/dcrdesign) repo. At the end of the funding period I will create a report in the form of a log, listing the larger tasks and goals which were completed, a summary of occurred expenditure, and any issues that occurred. Upon a successful practice, each 6 month season will receive a proposal to help keep a balance on transparency, work efficiency, and decentralization. 

# Areas of focus

The design domain has functioned since the near launch of Decred and over time breaks into three larger subdomains. 

**UI/UX:** in terms of this proposal is a larger umbrella, covering all of the design efforts towards improving Decred's products, the ecosystem as well as blockchain usability in general. Each product receives design support based on what's possible regarding development. The design domain provides: general UX design support, presents conceptual input on working out practical solutions, helps with the implementation and testing for bugs, as well works in general towards improving usability, efficiency, and accessibility where possible. 

**Identity:** Decred's logo, identity – it's methods, assets, guidelines and have been established by EETER. The approach has been iterative, improving, and refining the identity fundamentals over time as Decred's positioning matures. This has proven to be a natural and practical approach, as over time we have created a treasure-drove of practical methods, concepts, assets, and templates that have saved an enormous amount of production time in recycling. 

**Visual comms:** This subdomain mainly consists of mainly production work and providing design support to ad-hoc requests, ie. keynote presentations, social media posts, contributor portraits, print assets at events, etc. The items within this subdomain are generally with shorter shelf-life or less-critical use needs. As a rough consensus amongst the domain is keeping things light and holding a critical view on requests which are found excess and wasteful. Rather recycle practical identity assets and prior creations where possible. Questionable requests are reviewed in the design-ops, (which also includes core contributors from other domains)

# Budget and subdomain projects 

Below are budget caps for maximum billing amounts against this proposal and its subdomains. 
- Only design specific work based on spent hours can be billed against this proposal
- Designers continue to bill their existing rates in agreement with DHG
- Billing format: line item will contain, individual contractor/subcontractor name, occurred hours task, a short description (when possible reference to gh issue #nr)
- Billing is also tracked internally and submitted as a summarized report at the end of the period
- Budgets allow for re-allocation within subdomains if agreed on as a group and not conflicting with anyone else's work

**Pi-ui**
The UI library consolidation and improvements are likely one of the largest tasks. A goal is to create a consistent UIUX library with common components and methods which can be practically used and accessed anyone who is interested in contributing to Decred (whether development or design). We will also transition the work practice over from XD to Figma to make use of the improved functionality and accessibility-related features. [https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/213](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/213)
- Establishing the workflows on Figma
- Review and where reasoned update Decrediton and politeia components
- Establish a common UI library, in sync with design and front-end releases

**Decrediton**
Provide continuous UI/UX support to development. 
[https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/221](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/221)
- VSP onboarding and other tutorials (*in relation to motion and graphics production)
- Privacy/mixing and accounts UX
- Trezor setup UX
- Testing and implementation support
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**Politeia** 
Provide continuous UI/UX support to development.
[https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/222](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/222)
- Improve discussion and messaging experience 
- Improve proposal status lifecycle 
- Testing and implementation support
- Improve budgeting insights if development interest is present
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**Dcrweb**
Follow-up on the recent design updates round, re-asses, refine and finalize items 
[https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/220](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/220)

- Staking improvements on dcrweb, /vsp subpage overhaul 
(*in relation to motion and graphics production)
- News and Posts* – any efforts to help proceed with this
- Identity subpage – update and re-populate
- Support subpage
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**CMS**
- Conduct research on the current release and touchpoint on issues, areas with most need and potential for improvements
- Design support for on-going issues and requests

**Other products and requests - buffer**

In terms of DEX and other products for which work and tasks cannot be defined yet, I propose a small budget limit that can be billed against on needs basis if anything urgent comes up, in order not to cause any hold-ups.


## Identity
| Subdomain projects                                                    	| Key Contributors     	| 6 Month Budget (USD) 	|

- Production of motion assets to improve staking onboarding. These will be listed as core assets for practical use, as well are put to work on dcrweb (/vsp subpage) and Decrediton
[https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/217](https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/217)
- Update identity guidelines (including Pi and DEX), assets packages and improve accessibility on dcrweb and gh/dcrdesign
- Manage and assist with requests related to identity and its usage
- Proactively support best practices in Decred's identity use (ie. where found negatively presenting the project in high-value placement)

- Managing and responding to requests in need of design support in areas of project representation, communications, and visual branding, either via submission to gh/dcrdesign or from existing and proven project contributors.
- Monthly render visuals for dcrjournal (updates to pijournal if needed)
- Design and consulting on keynotes and presentations
- Key visuals/motion for releases and announcements

**Totals**

UI/UX $35 000

Identity $16 000

Visual Comms $14 000

The budgets above are calculated on a few factors: both known burn on tasks, higher-level estimates on larger tasks, an average of up to 2/d per week/contributor. 

The past 6 months' average billing rates have been below the budget averages in this proposal. If the budgets are not exhausted during the period these can be used to fund new design contributors, if the following is met: demonstrate positive character in collaboration and a median standard of work quality (thinking and production abilities) as well understanding of the project. Any addition to this proposal requires a DCC.

# Contributors

Decred design domain presently consists of around 6 active contributors - corporate contractors EETER (2, and a few passive collaborators), b42 (2) and 3 individuals contributors, Kyle, Lustosa and Mörphy.
