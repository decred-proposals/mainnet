You should all be very proud of what you have built, keep it up. What I would love to see is a toolbox of Decred branded collateral we can circulate in the wild. Think Decred design/branded digital banners, icons for stake/miners/pools etc, tools we can use to build up on the fly to issue Decred quality branding for announcements, events, presentations etc. Perhaps this already exists?. Almost like a toolbox repo the community can use to quickly put together fresh looking documents and snappy graphics. I'm not sure I know what I am asking for but hopefully it makes enough sense to flip the right lightbulb. Either way, you have my support.","signature":"93aa085fe3febfd9ffa8f8c1406464338b7994b56ab03b2ca14c06415e83b4ddaea5aaeebb31d1e755d093345fa23d28ac202292f5c655467d51cc99645d1f09","publickey":"aba709d1555efca8ba70f96f6f3bd8c1ebb0bd744b197df2925eae75d71c55f4","commentid":"5","receipt":"d113aa834bc56dc51e1fb471aea3c4cef7e42561c4e89b05ca984c7bee9ec79190a68d44559da70028bb80815880338f1fb82e392e26e65672087e6967cf9d09","timestamp":1597665607,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Majority of the resources are archived in the /dcrdesign rep; a bit more condensed form under releases https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases/tag/v004 and the lightest in /brand subpage. Part of the work above is recollecting, organizing and documenting the past years or so materials to the current repo, as well updating the guidelines and populating a new version of the /brand (or /design) subpage accordingly. The subpage update is actually built already in front-end as part of a prior update, so just behind getting the materials together. \n\nI get what you mean regarding the toolbox. We’ve given some thought on the matter a while back about taking the accessibility of the brand resources to a next level so to say. Ideally i’d see this in a form of a site that functions as a both very accessible resource center + docs in one. The accessibility side is kind of the easier part, as there’s bunch of clever things do streamline finding the right resources, ie. say someone looks for a dcr logo to print on a shirt -\u003e clarify these parameters in simple search -\u003e link to appropriate CMYK file, rather than the full package to search through. However on the best practices it’s a tougher front. We can only recommend things and your typical visual branding manual is unfortunately not so often referred to.","signature":"20e82d8666b124b3b3076bf1fb988fcfe9d4f4607d1cbc3c1f3df3c29d448b23e032028a5d9672fd55eb0873c4ac1e205af9da5e7a7946f8f749555fa11e9709","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"6","receipt":"f6b504fbeae5b127e6fc9ffbc3c09a01da0886c0985ffc79438afdd77d647374b70720a373d18cacbec5a44671d371c4763872a88aa3d9981aabb52d093e7f0e","timestamp":1597696857,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
