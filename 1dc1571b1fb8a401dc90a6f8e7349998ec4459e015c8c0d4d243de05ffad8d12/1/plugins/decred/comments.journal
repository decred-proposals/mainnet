You should all be very proud of what you have built, keep it up. What I would love to see is a toolbox of Decred branded collateral we can circulate in the wild. Think Decred design/branded digital banners, icons for stake/miners/pools etc, tools we can use to build up on the fly to issue Decred quality branding for announcements, events, presentations etc. Perhaps this already exists?. Almost like a toolbox repo the community can use to quickly put together fresh looking documents and snappy graphics. I'm not sure I know what I am asking for but hopefully it makes enough sense to flip the right lightbulb. Either way, you have my support.","signature":"93aa085fe3febfd9ffa8f8c1406464338b7994b56ab03b2ca14c06415e83b4ddaea5aaeebb31d1e755d093345fa23d28ac202292f5c655467d51cc99645d1f09","publickey":"aba709d1555efca8ba70f96f6f3bd8c1ebb0bd744b197df2925eae75d71c55f4","commentid":"5","receipt":"d113aa834bc56dc51e1fb471aea3c4cef7e42561c4e89b05ca984c7bee9ec79190a68d44559da70028bb80815880338f1fb82e392e26e65672087e6967cf9d09","timestamp":1597665607,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Majority of the resources are archived in the /dcrdesign rep; a bit more condensed form under releases https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases/tag/v004 and the lightest in /brand subpage. Part of the work above is recollecting, organizing and documenting the past years or so materials to the current repo, as well updating the guidelines and populating a new version of the /brand (or /design) subpage accordingly. The subpage update is actually built already in front-end as part of a prior update, so just behind getting the materials together. \n\nI get what you mean regarding the toolbox. We’ve given some thought on the matter a while back about taking the accessibility of the brand resources to a next level so to say. Ideally i’d see this in a form of a site that functions as a both very accessible resource center + docs in one. The accessibility side is kind of the easier part, as there’s bunch of clever things do streamline finding the right resources, ie. say someone looks for a dcr logo to print on a shirt -\u003e clarify these parameters in simple search -\u003e link to appropriate CMYK file, rather than the full package to search through. However on the best practices it’s a tougher front. We can only recommend things and your typical visual branding manual is unfortunately not so often referred to.","signature":"20e82d8666b124b3b3076bf1fb988fcfe9d4f4607d1cbc3c1f3df3c29d448b23e032028a5d9672fd55eb0873c4ac1e205af9da5e7a7946f8f749555fa11e9709","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"6","receipt":"f6b504fbeae5b127e6fc9ffbc3c09a01da0886c0985ffc79438afdd77d647374b70720a373d18cacbec5a44671d371c4763872a88aa3d9981aabb52d093e7f0e","timestamp":1597696857,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Other ways are to publish them on YouTube, Behance, Notion, Adope, LottieFiles, Sketch, etc. All these are proprietary platforms that host our files and offer no way to get them all at once and update incrementally. This is very different from source code produced by the development domain, where I can periodically update a dozen of Git repositories and get a full copy of everything. Even if we face any issues with GitHub, the Git repos could be re-hosted elsewhere. And the fact that full repositories are stored and synced by dozens of people makes this data very resilient. In case of design, all that is currently stored in Git is the README file.\n\nMy concern is that should anything happen to GitHub or the other platforms, community's access to design files will be interrupted.\n\nTo be fair, Git is not the best tool to store large binary files but I think it could handle repos below ~1 GB and work as an intermediate solution. For storing more data we can explore other tools, but even the good old file server with rsync would be more resilient than GitHub attachments.\n\nWhat do you think, and do you have plans to make design files better protected from loss, like put them in a Git repo?","signature":"97268011f47d91a1d68df7b98c68ab95da0429069fccbb6619870214c532e08a4ed53ae112bbb08131d49a61099601d88d740ec94fe6539ebf607f356cdae702","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"11","receipt":"bdc54154b08caeb2587b45d20d0c5ef306bd17977b870bb6f2c14f41b6fe9e8fde1c2bb911c477bd4d187be38300618525e4f1938fa98b23b97e6d8258fb2004","timestamp":1597880065,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Abstracting from its weak architecture for a second, Electrum wallet is a good example of that, UI-wise: basic \"boring\" widgets, no animations/shadows/blur/advanced fonts/etc and it does the job to send/receive funds, manage keys, and such. Because of this preference I'm not a fan of Decrediton and I'm ok with command line, but I admit it is not the most productive UX to deal with.\n\nI realize that command-line UIs is not an option for most users if we talk about the broad adoption we all want. But I have no idea for how many people it is important to have not just \"boring\" basic gray GUI like Electrum, but a \"rich UI\" like Decrediton.\n\nSo my first question is, is this rich design driven by demand? How many people prefer it over the minimalist style? Is it safe to assume that my type is the minority? :) And for example, how do you make desisions like adding dark mode to Politeia?\n\nNext thing, I do love beauitful UIs myself, but only when it doesn't come at the cost of two important aspects - security and resources.\n\nThe first is a tradeoff between rich visuals and security of software. Implementing rich design requires adding more code and dependencies. Not a big issue for a weather app, but extra code and dependencies that have not been audited for handling serious stuff like money is my main concern about rich design in crypto software.\n\nSecond is resources. Rich complex designs consume more storage, memory, and battery. I'd love Decred software to run on decade old devices since they are easier to debloat and secure. And they are cheap, which is good for decentralization.\n\nCould you please comment on how design domain is taking these concerns into account?","signature":"7bc62aeb5a76e070dfca088d20cb2e1f28e2548cc85c69c43c9f85338bdcdf98bae7fcbab0fa76fa53376d3b73dba6531525ba7df68ce6285989f05dff7a4104","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"13","receipt":"ffd5886aed0f4f0ed6fe3cd26c854efda6cc71ca56915c55bb1681175d9c7e25638d7064837a74bbf2dd38219f39997b3b416301bdd173fb9dafb90d2da79607","timestamp":1597882356,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I’d paraphrase a bit on the stated terms on the minimal and rich design. Electrum has a minimal GUI in a sense of using base windows components iirc and being bare-bones in using them only to get the functionality done. Decrediton has its custom UI components, with its own rationale to best support the functionality and usability. \n\nNow the components are just the artifacts from a visual design stage, which can be richer or simpler in visual terms based what makes sense. Either can make sense, and either has pro's / con's. But whether one or other makes for a good UX is a much broader topic. So for example I could make a case for electrum’s UI having an inadequate use of space in some areas, and too many details, causing complexity in a different area. Comes down to a number of fundamentals that make up the rendering of different intentions.\n\nAnother consideration of the visual side is the psychological share. Just talking about the visual outlook of the app matters a fair bit when applied to broader and more mainstream use. If one's funds are on the line, the first impression of something looking potentially \"dodgy\" or just crude will more likely make the person question using it, if not alienate.\n\nTo put the various cases on a chart: i'd say command-line software is obviously for the most technical users and developers; something that's bare-bones function-oriented GUI, with little finesse on the usability side is perfectly fine for early adaptors, testers and tech savy users; whereas a more refined UI is most appropriate for broader mainstream use, ie. being on-bar with common practices and standards of everyday banking UI's, etc as well taking the effort to onboard and educate the users on concepts that are novel to crypto space. \n\nTo answer the questions:\n\n1. The “rich” design as described is for making it the product more accessible and appropriate for a broader user base. \u2028\n\n2. Decisions on bigger changes and features generally happen on demand and over collaboration. I believe dark mode is pretty popular amongst developers and has solid reasoning otherwise. As you know anyone can suggest ideas to improve things and ultimately we do only work on things that get traction and are picked up by the developers.\n\n3. Security: It's pretty well rooted amongst the dcr designers that we don’t create things that have 3rd party requirements, or typically it's consulted with the devs if a security concern is found. Ie. no comfy features like fiat price tracking in decrediton.\n\n4. Resources/efficiency: I do myself appreciate the similar goals on a personal level and find it a noble pursuit to go after efficiency where possible. Though there's a fine line where things get too robust and compromise the usability too much … or you know become more appropriate for a niche rather than broader use. So a matter of balance. The GUI's visual design is what it is on each release and does change (hopefully for the better) with each new release. I do think we've matured things over time as the project itself matures, ie. on the identity and visual comms side you can see much more geometric and conceptual pieces in opposed to more colorful characters and illustrations, but also the same applies with more nuance in the GUI's, ie. pi-ui, finessing and dialing down for the GUI to be more invisible, like a good book design what doesn't take away attention from reading.","signature":"cd8a309c9837a05d7003fbe802f6b6ec8b4ebe6995580651a331a035a5cb19a2f26e955b3efdd4cb958e54a9251d4b6d94731ffe2e889938141389fc17638704","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"14","receipt":"7440b0afb9b6a534b1724e33c8799ba977917ce4b902b2bb48af37b6fc8e5e9b392cc5e82f960d1f4393b528d4cd4bb0b41f9d5ca301740c22d6938b01e81606","timestamp":1598023278,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

More active testing and looking out for feedback during the releases, less in-between. There’s no kind of common feedback practice, but rather just noted down over gh and what comes up in matrix channels. One improvement in this area is furthering the use of gh/dcrdesign for requests by working our better guideline containers for the issue creation and rooting its use. Though I do think if there's a noticeable increase in users – it would make a solid project on its own to establish a feedback collection and archiving system. I would make the case that it should actually be separate from the product repo's if done on a bigger scale. There's examples in gh of products using chat bots tied to gh, that result in several thousand+ open issues, all mixed with support questions just bloat the repo. This may be a good initiative for anyone with the experience to pick up. Plenty of tools and processes to consider.","signature":"f42b63903e572fbd49535fe7c0826c4b3a42fe8e0f724750f875404537f7e06626b4898227c6db5e752ef9275a2e9f30f2735017f3e1c1e6e851f05a01030801","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"15","receipt":"0048e8a34ed932e3cb33feaf5a0cb3315de35667d4696bdfc731993a2ad1fb840593239b9bce98394f52d3a2e32035e7925bc8e9f596297e0bc46ea9bf34200e","timestamp":1598023654,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This needs some further thought as its both an issue of having things well organized + the size limits. At the current state it would need quite a lot of manual work to essentially work out a back-up system of everything (including commentary on things) on a regular basis. I'd say the most realistic case is getting releases on /dcrdesign to be more periodic, and looking to future aim to reduce the need of different platforms where it makes sense. The releases recollect and keep up to date the fundamentals and master files updates as well produced assets, as also described in the proposal. Backing that up in bulk is simpler, but there is obviously a loss of additional context, commentary, previewing comforts and details which the different platforms productivity related features provide. Releases can be kept on different contractors personal storages if up for this.","signature":"ac8780d596e773e2b644e65144404999ce0ad207446b1630e83af957695ae0b4905666bfaf42779ffbf5321b86019e156f4173370fd85e61d3e09457dcfeff02","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"16","receipt":"f9ffd9daadea414d87f509eb06159b84238f6f42c298287087beaf950eaf4ff4a811ea369ac8e33588fb44f51168fd8f073890190c1e59c348bffaaf8b377b07","timestamp":1598024264,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Nevertheless there's plenty of valuable thinking that can be brought to the table from the design expertise to improve the product. And through that improve the contractors work experience. I wouldn't neglect it, even if most are capable of just getting by with any rough UI. Will add up in a bigger picture if all 50+ contractors involved for example save a bit of time every month with their operations in CMS.","signature":"7041ec27a6b52d7cb4890950c9508423b2d6ddfadf285f0888c618739ead3861fad9a1886465d4917f81c6a20919588ba82044b5f9d1ff75d7fd2bbb7ca6ae08","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"17","receipt":"24d7ed954dd2dfa97a33aface37ae075d92fb8c4c323d78bfc8b523d3606db3d0d5a9146b240327106583c90789eb857bee3240a8d455b5860287604aa324800","timestamp":1598025201,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The react implementation of the component library is obviously aimed for react-based projects. An implementation to another framework can certainly be done, though this I can't tell whether its easier to do based off the already made react work, or simply working off the UI components in Figma. The latter certainly provides a pretty solid base to either manually or semi-automatically export things to html+css for sure. To your comment – this is one of the goals of the component library, to provide a consistent and practical toolset, that's designed with DCR specific intentions in mind.","signature":"144d71e3805a1b5d201e5450f40e002f561e228f70fd5e45f0326c1b4b080aad19099db91c8b6e1a1607f352f0f2cd8ad36a94de5b060844a6558f6221965402","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"18","receipt":"e19828b8147e0e8b65ba6ae81fbec64a1471956e4ee378ae52b04b605238a141a7d1612c83f7cc910c52c57846e5d8d85302a57591deaa761ea2fa854185b602","timestamp":1598025666,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The individual contractors rates and their spending is private. The whole domain spending has been approved per each contractor by jy-p prior to this and not really tracked by the sub categories formally. Spending matters have only been brought up on a number of times in case of specific issues/red flags or reviewing work costs that are difficult to determine. Because we're just establishing a formal way of tracking and reporting this, I can just say the first half of this year till now for all design contributors to my knowledge has been significantly lower than in the proposed budgets.

I received several sets of renders to use for the title image of each issue, which I was very happy with. I think I received 15-16 such images. \n\nFor the shorter issues, I started wondering whether it was worth using a whole fresh new render, because these issues are quite cheap to produce the cost of the title render may end up being a significant portion of the whole cost. So, I started to re-use some of the older renders by swapping out the dates.\n\nI don't know how much each render for Politeia Digest costs exactly. I would like to get some more produced but I don't know how much it makes sense to spend on these. Pi digest has a budget which is ~20% of the Journal, so maybe it makes sense to split the budget for Journal/Digest images in this proposal (3,500 for 6 months) in roughly the same way. I don't know, and I'm pretty flexible. The next steps would seem to be decide how many images Pi digest will get in this 6 months and then produce the blank templates at your (or sænder's) leisure, and I can add them into the rotation.","signature":"95c386ed2c9f1bcd4b1ec177b9ec91c8b95815e908ff4f529a1a4f12881b76635e145fbdbe66b054174442b9f53c48cbc540aac91d97cd580c01939ff9cb9703","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"20","receipt":"b83aa5d7e47fcd816afed8d140ec3f76bdcc6511f10cff7c106bd8390e49143ed4de1c0eed10095c49dbc41c74eec5763c231eba8b340bc47d1da2b22bb7680f","timestamp":1598101107,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
