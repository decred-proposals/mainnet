You should all be very proud of what you have built, keep it up. What I would love to see is a toolbox of Decred branded collateral we can circulate in the wild. Think Decred design/branded digital banners, icons for stake/miners/pools etc, tools we can use to build up on the fly to issue Decred quality branding for announcements, events, presentations etc. Perhaps this already exists?. Almost like a toolbox repo the community can use to quickly put together fresh looking documents and snappy graphics. I'm not sure I know what I am asking for but hopefully it makes enough sense to flip the right lightbulb. Either way, you have my support.","signature":"93aa085fe3febfd9ffa8f8c1406464338b7994b56ab03b2ca14c06415e83b4ddaea5aaeebb31d1e755d093345fa23d28ac202292f5c655467d51cc99645d1f09","publickey":"aba709d1555efca8ba70f96f6f3bd8c1ebb0bd744b197df2925eae75d71c55f4","commentid":"5","receipt":"d113aa834bc56dc51e1fb471aea3c4cef7e42561c4e89b05ca984c7bee9ec79190a68d44559da70028bb80815880338f1fb82e392e26e65672087e6967cf9d09","timestamp":1597665607,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Majority of the resources are archived in the /dcrdesign rep; a bit more condensed form under releases https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/releases/tag/v004 and the lightest in /brand subpage. Part of the work above is recollecting, organizing and documenting the past years or so materials to the current repo, as well updating the guidelines and populating a new version of the /brand (or /design) subpage accordingly. The subpage update is actually built already in front-end as part of a prior update, so just behind getting the materials together. \n\nI get what you mean regarding the toolbox. We’ve given some thought on the matter a while back about taking the accessibility of the brand resources to a next level so to say. Ideally i’d see this in a form of a site that functions as a both very accessible resource center + docs in one. The accessibility side is kind of the easier part, as there’s bunch of clever things do streamline finding the right resources, ie. say someone looks for a dcr logo to print on a shirt -\u003e clarify these parameters in simple search -\u003e link to appropriate CMYK file, rather than the full package to search through. However on the best practices it’s a tougher front. We can only recommend things and your typical visual branding manual is unfortunately not so often referred to.","signature":"20e82d8666b124b3b3076bf1fb988fcfe9d4f4607d1cbc3c1f3df3c29d448b23e032028a5d9672fd55eb0873c4ac1e205af9da5e7a7946f8f749555fa11e9709","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"6","receipt":"f6b504fbeae5b127e6fc9ffbc3c09a01da0886c0985ffc79438afdd77d647374b70720a373d18cacbec5a44671d371c4763872a88aa3d9981aabb52d093e7f0e","timestamp":1597696857,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Other ways are to publish them on YouTube, Behance, Notion, Adope, LottieFiles, Sketch, etc. All these are proprietary platforms that host our files and offer no way to get them all at once and update incrementally. This is very different from source code produced by the development domain, where I can periodically update a dozen of Git repositories and get a full copy of everything. Even if we face any issues with GitHub, the Git repos could be re-hosted elsewhere. And the fact that full repositories are stored and synced by dozens of people makes this data very resilient. In case of design, all that is currently stored in Git is the README file.\n\nMy concern is that should anything happen to GitHub or the other platforms, community's access to design files will be interrupted.\n\nTo be fair, Git is not the best tool to store large binary files but I think it could handle repos below ~1 GB and work as an intermediate solution. For storing more data we can explore other tools, but even the good old file server with rsync would be more resilient than GitHub attachments.\n\nWhat do you think, and do you have plans to make design files better protected from loss, like put them in a Git repo?","signature":"97268011f47d91a1d68df7b98c68ab95da0429069fccbb6619870214c532e08a4ed53ae112bbb08131d49a61099601d88d740ec94fe6539ebf607f356cdae702","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"11","receipt":"bdc54154b08caeb2587b45d20d0c5ef306bd17977b870bb6f2c14f41b6fe9e8fde1c2bb911c477bd4d187be38300618525e4f1938fa98b23b97e6d8258fb2004","timestamp":1597880065,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Abstracting from its weak architecture for a second, Electrum wallet is a good example of that, UI-wise: basic \"boring\" widgets, no animations/shadows/blur/advanced fonts/etc and it does the job to send/receive funds, manage keys, and such. Because of this preference I'm not a fan of Decrediton and I'm ok with command line, but I admit it is not the most productive UX to deal with.\n\nI realize that command-line UIs is not an option for most users if we talk about the broad adoption we all want. But I have no idea for how many people it is important to have not just \"boring\" basic gray GUI like Electrum, but a \"rich UI\" like Decrediton.\n\nSo my first question is, is this rich design driven by demand? How many people prefer it over the minimalist style? Is it safe to assume that my type is the minority? :) And for example, how do you make desisions like adding dark mode to Politeia?\n\nNext thing, I do love beauitful UIs myself, but only when it doesn't come at the cost of two important aspects - security and resources.\n\nThe first is a tradeoff between rich visuals and security of software. Implementing rich design requires adding more code and dependencies. Not a big issue for a weather app, but extra code and dependencies that have not been audited for handling serious stuff like money is my main concern about rich design in crypto software.\n\nSecond is resources. Rich complex designs consume more storage, memory, and battery. I'd love Decred software to run on decade old devices since they are easier to debloat and secure. And they are cheap, which is good for decentralization.\n\nCould you please comment on how design domain is taking these concerns into account?","signature":"7bc62aeb5a76e070dfca088d20cb2e1f28e2548cc85c69c43c9f85338bdcdf98bae7fcbab0fa76fa53376d3b73dba6531525ba7df68ce6285989f05dff7a4104","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"13","receipt":"ffd5886aed0f4f0ed6fe3cd26c854efda6cc71ca56915c55bb1681175d9c7e25638d7064837a74bbf2dd38219f39997b3b416301bdd173fb9dafb90d2da79607","timestamp":1597882356,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I’d paraphrase a bit on the stated terms on the minimal and rich design. Electrum has a minimal GUI in a sense of using base windows components iirc and being bare-bones in using them only to get the functionality done. Decrediton has its custom UI components, with its own rationale to best support the functionality and usability. \n\nNow the components are just the artifacts from a visual design stage, which can be richer or simpler in visual terms based what makes sense. Either can make sense, and either has pro's / con's. But whether one or other makes for a good UX is a much broader topic. So for example I could make a case for electrum’s UI having an inadequate use of space in some areas, and too many details, causing complexity in a different area. Comes down to a number of fundamentals that make up the rendering of different intentions.\n\nAnother consideration of the visual side is the psychological share. Just talking about the visual outlook of the app matters a fair bit when applied to broader and more mainstream use. If one's funds are on the line, the first impression of something looking potentially \"dodgy\" or just crude will more likely make the person question using it, if not alienate.\n\nTo put the various cases on a chart: i'd say command-line software is obviously for the most technical users and developers; something that's bare-bones function-oriented GUI, with little finesse on the usability side is perfectly fine for early adaptors, testers and tech savy users; whereas a more refined UI is most appropriate for broader mainstream use, ie. being on-bar with common practices and standards of everyday banking UI's, etc as well taking the effort to onboard and educate the users on concepts that are novel to crypto space. \n\nTo answer the questions:\n\n1. The “rich” design as described is for making it the product more accessible and appropriate for a broader user base. \u2028\n\n2. Decisions on bigger changes and features generally happen on demand and over collaboration. I believe dark mode is pretty popular amongst developers and has solid reasoning otherwise. As you know anyone can suggest ideas to improve things and ultimately we do only work on things that get traction and are picked up by the developers.\n\n3. Security: It's pretty well rooted amongst the dcr designers that we don’t create things that have 3rd party requirements, or typically it's consulted with the devs if a security concern is found. Ie. no comfy features like fiat price tracking in decrediton.\n\n4. Resources/efficiency: I do myself appreciate the similar goals on a personal level and find it a noble pursuit to go after efficiency where possible. Though there's a fine line where things get too robust and compromise the usability too much … or you know become more appropriate for a niche rather than broader use. So a matter of balance. The GUI's visual design is what it is on each release and does change (hopefully for the better) with each new release. I do think we've matured things over time as the project itself matures, ie. on the identity and visual comms side you can see much more geometric and conceptual pieces in opposed to more colorful characters and illustrations, but also the same applies with more nuance in the GUI's, ie. pi-ui, finessing and dialing down for the GUI to be more invisible, like a good book design what doesn't take away attention from reading.","signature":"cd8a309c9837a05d7003fbe802f6b6ec8b4ebe6995580651a331a035a5cb19a2f26e955b3efdd4cb958e54a9251d4b6d94731ffe2e889938141389fc17638704","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"14","receipt":"7440b0afb9b6a534b1724e33c8799ba977917ce4b902b2bb48af37b6fc8e5e9b392cc5e82f960d1f4393b528d4cd4bb0b41f9d5ca301740c22d6938b01e81606","timestamp":1598023278,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

More active testing and looking out for feedback during the releases, less in-between. There’s no kind of common feedback practice, but rather just noted down over gh and what comes up in matrix channels. One improvement in this area is furthering the use of gh/dcrdesign for requests by working our better guideline containers for the issue creation and rooting its use. Though I do think if there's a noticeable increase in users – it would make a solid project on its own to establish a feedback collection and archiving system. I would make the case that it should actually be separate from the product repo's if done on a bigger scale. There's examples in gh of products using chat bots tied to gh, that result in several thousand+ open issues, all mixed with support questions just bloat the repo. This may be a good initiative for anyone with the experience to pick up. Plenty of tools and processes to consider.","signature":"f42b63903e572fbd49535fe7c0826c4b3a42fe8e0f724750f875404537f7e06626b4898227c6db5e752ef9275a2e9f30f2735017f3e1c1e6e851f05a01030801","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"15","receipt":"0048e8a34ed932e3cb33feaf5a0cb3315de35667d4696bdfc731993a2ad1fb840593239b9bce98394f52d3a2e32035e7925bc8e9f596297e0bc46ea9bf34200e","timestamp":1598023654,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This needs some further thought as its both an issue of having things well organized + the size limits. At the current state it would need quite a lot of manual work to essentially work out a back-up system of everything (including commentary on things) on a regular basis. I'd say the most realistic case is getting releases on /dcrdesign to be more periodic, and looking to future aim to reduce the need of different platforms where it makes sense. The releases recollect and keep up to date the fundamentals and master files updates as well produced assets, as also described in the proposal. Backing that up in bulk is simpler, but there is obviously a loss of additional context, commentary, previewing comforts and details which the different platforms productivity related features provide. Releases can be kept on different contractors personal storages if up for this.","signature":"ac8780d596e773e2b644e65144404999ce0ad207446b1630e83af957695ae0b4905666bfaf42779ffbf5321b86019e156f4173370fd85e61d3e09457dcfeff02","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"16","receipt":"f9ffd9daadea414d87f509eb06159b84238f6f42c298287087beaf950eaf4ff4a811ea369ac8e33588fb44f51168fd8f073890190c1e59c348bffaaf8b377b07","timestamp":1598024264,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Nevertheless there's plenty of valuable thinking that can be brought to the table from the design expertise to improve the product. And through that improve the contractors work experience. I wouldn't neglect it, even if most are capable of just getting by with any rough UI. Will add up in a bigger picture if all 50+ contractors involved for example save a bit of time every month with their operations in CMS.","signature":"7041ec27a6b52d7cb4890950c9508423b2d6ddfadf285f0888c618739ead3861fad9a1886465d4917f81c6a20919588ba82044b5f9d1ff75d7fd2bbb7ca6ae08","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"17","receipt":"24d7ed954dd2dfa97a33aface37ae075d92fb8c4c323d78bfc8b523d3606db3d0d5a9146b240327106583c90789eb857bee3240a8d455b5860287604aa324800","timestamp":1598025201,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The react implementation of the component library is obviously aimed for react-based projects. An implementation to another framework can certainly be done, though this I can't tell whether its easier to do based off the already made react work, or simply working off the UI components in Figma. The latter certainly provides a pretty solid base to either manually or semi-automatically export things to html+css for sure. To your comment – this is one of the goals of the component library, to provide a consistent and practical toolset, that's designed with DCR specific intentions in mind.","signature":"144d71e3805a1b5d201e5450f40e002f561e228f70fd5e45f0326c1b4b080aad19099db91c8b6e1a1607f352f0f2cd8ad36a94de5b060844a6558f6221965402","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"18","receipt":"e19828b8147e0e8b65ba6ae81fbec64a1471956e4ee378ae52b04b605238a141a7d1612c83f7cc910c52c57846e5d8d85302a57591deaa761ea2fa854185b602","timestamp":1598025666,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The individual contractors rates and their spending is private. The whole domain spending has been approved per each contractor by jy-p prior to this and not really tracked by the sub categories formally. Spending matters have only been brought up on a number of times in case of specific issues/red flags or reviewing work costs that are difficult to determine. Because we're just establishing a formal way of tracking and reporting this, I can just say the first half of this year till now for all design contributors to my knowledge has been significantly lower than in the proposed budgets.

I received several sets of renders to use for the title image of each issue, which I was very happy with. I think I received 15-16 such images. \n\nFor the shorter issues, I started wondering whether it was worth using a whole fresh new render, because these issues are quite cheap to produce the cost of the title render may end up being a significant portion of the whole cost. So, I started to re-use some of the older renders by swapping out the dates.\n\nI don't know how much each render for Politeia Digest costs exactly. I would like to get some more produced but I don't know how much it makes sense to spend on these. Pi digest has a budget which is ~20% of the Journal, so maybe it makes sense to split the budget for Journal/Digest images in this proposal (3,500 for 6 months) in roughly the same way. I don't know, and I'm pretty flexible. The next steps would seem to be decide how many images Pi digest will get in this 6 months and then produce the blank templates at your (or sænder's) leisure, and I can add them into the rotation.","signature":"95c386ed2c9f1bcd4b1ec177b9ec91c8b95815e908ff4f529a1a4f12881b76635e145fbdbe66b054174442b9f53c48cbc540aac91d97cd580c01939ff9cb9703","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"20","receipt":"b83aa5d7e47fcd816afed8d140ec3f76bdcc6511f10cff7c106bd8390e49143ed4de1c0eed10095c49dbc41c74eec5763c231eba8b340bc47d1da2b22bb7680f","timestamp":1598101107,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But still it's a good idea to optimize costs when possible.\n\nOne shower thought here is I would ask sænder if it is possible to find a balance between reusing identical images and making a whole fresh new render when the issue is short. Perhaps it is possible to cheaply generate multiple variations for each render (slightly different camera, colors or other effects, etc). If the issue is short, pick such variant. If it is full-sized, move on to the next render.","signature":"61897028a03a4c6cbf99ddb50bcaf40a4774c0a3622b6ba03020623bd396c62fb1d6020abcdd5028e71757835ab9ff08cdc0bb7ece88446ac9697fc1c15bc100","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"24","receipt":"f268333130cec5c2e89df599f3c94a7d03d558197a26040bb0d24ccf20b2a74f5c902a07ad6c4529c72b77559f7f4905039c7826705649b9355af8c1160f3409","timestamp":1598134360,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Even transitions and animations (that I always disable) add to it, as they help the eyes to follow \"what goes where\".\n\nI know devs love dark modes, but wasn't sure about Politeia _users_. I wouldn't call it outright useless though, since some people can (rightfully) get impressed by the fact that not only our governance platform has professional design but also a dark mode for late night decision makers. These small details add up and contribute to an overall impression about the project.\n\nRe security, I referred to code and library dependencies rather than 3rd party network requests (which should be used with great care too, obviously). For example, I'm not sure which number of Decrediton [dependencies](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/network/dependencies) should I use (116, 126 or 1,361 (omg)), but in any case it is quite a lot and a pretty large surface for possible security issues. To be fair, devs would know better how many of them had to be added to implement the rich design.\n\n\u003e on the identity and visual comms side you can see much more geometric and conceptual pieces in opposed to more colorful characters and illustrations\n\nI really appreciate this direction.\n\n\u003e dialing down for the GUI to be more invisible, like a good book design what doesn't take away attention from reading\n\nThis is a great way to think about UI/UX.\n\nGood answers, thanks for your time!","signature":"e11b739a6dfe161de77b2c0bc43f5357661f3b39ed73307834cd5b0cb51ab5309c88cdac2935348cb4c4125fce73029919325b5b9886b927029b7be472181e09","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"25","receipt":"fa297da8386b7d12c33bfbdd82197b42008ac33685586fdf55880ac90a425ae61328b9c1b74f8c9737238ac59f432041cad9a90f7455c1cf3a534668dd038f0e","timestamp":1598135608,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I find this proposal to be reasonable, but I will also provide broader feedback about the design domains accomplishments here as well as information for the decred community on actions that can to be taken. Work from morphymore on the mobile wallets with material design has been quite polished. There has been strong coordination between him and the mobile wallets teams. I was surprised to see mobile listed under the design budget without any prior notice from linnutee, as there has been no known discussion or involvement from linnutee on mobile since morphymore was referred to begin working with the the mobile wallet team. An overarching theme I continue to see is a lack of connection between the design domain and the technology teams.\n\nThere have been multiple iterations of videos produced for Decred, both of which are produced with high quality visuals and branding, but strongly lacking in technical explanation. My concern is this type of branding facade which is disconnected from the technology doesn't distinguish Decred from the large sea of other crypto projects which are also easily able to dump money into style and branding. Other crypto projects do not have the strong technical foundations which distinguish us from the crowd. I had started work on solving this problem some time ago and produced a short video on a small budget called How Decred is Unique. The effort was criticized for taking initiative without clearly alerting the design team leads, and subsequent efforts to improve upon the video were met with a lack of availability from the design team. To this day, the How Decred is Unique video is often reused in clips by the public because its a video that actually talks about and illustrates how Decred works. The result this leaves us with today, is the original How Decred is Unique video continues to be syndicated in its original form without being updated. It leaves us with a void in high quality explainer videos which are informative as well as captivating. This dramatically weakens us in an area that is a primary avenue for people on the internet to learn about Decred. It is notable that Exitus has come along and has been creating high quality bi-weekly videos on current events. His work has been the biggest strength added to Decred on the video front.\n\nA large focus of this proposal is UI/UX, but it does not appear there are strong feedback loops with users or that any measurements are being taken in regards to effectiveness. My team was able to gather user experience feedback from working with local crypto meetup groups to observe the onboarding process for Decrediton users. What we found was that \u003e50% of non-technical users attempting to get into staking with Decrediton ended up abandoning the process within 6 weeks due to not being able to get through the complicated setup process without encountering errors, or unsolvable errors related to staking happening after completing the setup process. We then looked at the complication in the user experience and determined that much of the registration process causing errors for users with stakepools was unnecessary. We were able to map out a new streamlined process for users which switched from a user based authentication to ticket based authentication. Certainly this required technical understanding to solve, but it was from understanding the failure points in the user experience that the problem was identified. This is distinct from contributions in style and branding.\n\nOne of the tools that would be most useful to the Decred community right now is print materials that they can download, take to their local print shop, and create a stack of post cards to distribute to their local communities. I would think this would fall in the design domain, but there is also a lack of coordination with a copy writing domain to create the content. https://github.com/decred/dcrdesign/issues/149  There exists some print materials with good style and branding, but the information is confusing, and it doesn't provide the information users need to get them converted and on-boarded to Decred.\n\nThe website has the same issue. The style and branding are front and center, taking up lots of space, but the site lacks a clear and efficient means of navigation.","signature":"cc77bd3d59826bd82c0d6549e91e3c7e876e2263ac22fcba159508f4c61854f2fc8d695be483cb749647ced234ded2db62e8f0998bdc57a317946191835a490e","publickey":"eb82b264d3dad64ca85f5167f6bd5cf64897d546159cdb12303edd50cc7b47d1","commentid":"26","receipt":"30cb2aa0403d7a017579eaea322c66d643fe424f2a9cf8710a563ddf6451c46de962a395ddfe6f8d81b79f85254a20a75ff2b634302cb0fcf9f0acb7c032180c","timestamp":1598210900,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
