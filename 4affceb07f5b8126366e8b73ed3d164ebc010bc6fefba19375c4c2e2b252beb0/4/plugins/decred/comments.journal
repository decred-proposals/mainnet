Even Bitcoin appears for the first time in the book only in 4th chapter (out of 12). The goal of the book is to compile the whole story of cryptocurrencies, explain how things evolved in the context, and provide the reader with hints where to look further. Therefore, there is not much space to elaborate on each project into detail as there are many dozens of them mentioned in the book. \n\n I do write about DCR in the Altcoin section in terms of its consensus algorithm, and I actually wanted to write about it more in the part focused on governance where I wanted to describe how cool is that even this book could get funded via treasury in a decentralized manner. I understand that you don't see the \"necessity\" to fund it. I do write this book for the cryptocurrency community, and want to make it accessible as much as possible (maybe at some point release it for free completely, but not sure yet ), so I can't imagine a better or more understanding audience than crypto tribes such as Decred community.  \n\nAs mentioned in the proposal, yes the decision to (not)fund the book does not impact the content of the book. \n\nAs per other sponsors, I just started to reach out to companies and communities so there is none confirmed but I am in talks with multiple projects, I don't wanna give names as I don't feel it is polite, but they include Bitcoin ATM companies, Smart contract platforms, DeFi Apps, or other altcoin communities. \n\nAs you can imagine this kind of book is not a profitable endeavor, and all I wanted to do is to raise funds from the crypto community, to cover the costs to release it, and potentially fund translations to other languages.

Given this would be a nominal donation, the Treasury is essentially speculating on awareness raised by this book (and thus speculating on the the success of the book). \n\nIf I return to an objective, Best for Decred position, I suggest that for the Treasury to consider speculating on such an  outcome requires explicit content related to why Decred's donation is very different to that of a VC backed DeFi product. What I would propose is that a section in the book describing how the treasury model works and in fact even making reference this proposal process.   I feel that without bringing the nuance and uniqueness of DCR funding to the foreground, it is simply not enough to justify the expense (as much as I have warmed to the idea).","signature":"f38b1afa443519a2c9aee042f2062902a3e37e3aed2f50f9fe1f7adf0cde62c371ac054e8c3988a958ef712dda5ac527ee7573e37a3e120f7561727806e70d04","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"18","receipt":"7202fc9774a40b37d830700390ea62ec7430aeb3fb5fc67931414dcd1cf67de1aef758bfc022de6892afccda63db4b71fed5ca17e08c2d10d16cd5e852de9305","timestamp":1590143617,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
