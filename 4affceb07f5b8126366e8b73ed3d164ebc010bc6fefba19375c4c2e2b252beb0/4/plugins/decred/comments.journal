Even Bitcoin appears for the first time in the book only in 4th chapter (out of 12). The goal of the book is to compile the whole story of cryptocurrencies, explain how things evolved in the context, and provide the reader with hints where to look further. Therefore, there is not much space to elaborate on each project into detail as there are many dozens of them mentioned in the book. \n\n I do write about DCR in the Altcoin section in terms of its consensus algorithm, and I actually wanted to write about it more in the part focused on governance where I wanted to describe how cool is that even this book could get funded via treasury in a decentralized manner. I understand that you don't see the \"necessity\" to fund it. I do write this book for the cryptocurrency community, and want to make it accessible as much as possible (maybe at some point release it for free completely, but not sure yet ), so I can't imagine a better or more understanding audience than crypto tribes such as Decred community.  \n\nAs mentioned in the proposal, yes the decision to (not)fund the book does not impact the content of the book. \n\nAs per other sponsors, I just started to reach out to companies and communities so there is none confirmed but I am in talks with multiple projects, I don't wanna give names as I don't feel it is polite, but they include Bitcoin ATM companies, Smart contract platforms, DeFi Apps, or other altcoin communities. \n\nAs you can imagine this kind of book is not a profitable endeavor, and all I wanted to do is to raise funds from the crypto community, to cover the costs to release it, and potentially fund translations to other languages.

Given this would be a nominal donation, the Treasury is essentially speculating on awareness raised by this book (and thus speculating on the the success of the book). \n\nIf I return to an objective, Best for Decred position, I suggest that for the Treasury to consider speculating on such an  outcome requires explicit content related to why Decred's donation is very different to that of a VC backed DeFi product. What I would propose is that a section in the book describing how the treasury model works and in fact even making reference this proposal process.   I feel that without bringing the nuance and uniqueness of DCR funding to the foreground, it is simply not enough to justify the expense (as much as I have warmed to the idea).","signature":"f38b1afa443519a2c9aee042f2062902a3e37e3aed2f50f9fe1f7adf0cde62c371ac054e8c3988a958ef712dda5ac527ee7573e37a3e120f7561727806e70d04","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"18","receipt":"7202fc9774a40b37d830700390ea62ec7430aeb3fb5fc67931414dcd1cf67de1aef758bfc022de6892afccda63db4b71fed5ca17e08c2d10d16cd5e852de9305","timestamp":1590143617,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I would personally read such a book.\n\n#### Issues and concerns\n\nI don't like the idea to sponsor a book that will not be fully free and open source since its inception. The main motivation for me to support such proposal would be to maximize the reach of the message about cryptocurrencies and Decred. The problem is, the idea that there is a robust solution to a broken fiat system is somehow still not popular, 11 years since the launch of Bitcoin and after two global financial crises. Any attempts to hold the \"ownership\" of information and make an extra buck further suppress the spread of already unpopular message.\n\nWhen an author makes content freely available it is a proof that he is more interested in sharing his knowledge rather than making profit or building his brand. A free book would also attract more contributions to improve it, further reinforcing its distribution. Look at the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. It is fully open yet it is extremely popular.\n\nIn general we have a strong preference for open-sourced deliverables that are funded by the Treasury. \"Decred has sponsored a free and open-sourced book\" reads much better than \"Decred has sponsored a non-free copyrighted book\". Personally I would rather vote for a bigger budget but one that funds a free book.\n\nSadly I'm late with this comment now that the vote has been authorized and no edits are possible (I think).\n\nMaking the printed version available for purhcase for DCR would be very nice.\n\n#### Notes\n\nBecause it answered some of my questions, copying some info from the linked May 2020 [sponsorship proposal](https://www.stanceldavid.sk/book/) document (which was last updated May 20):\n\n- fundraising goal: EUR 12K for book editing, design, formatting, and publishing (printed 1,500 pieces)\n- length: 70K-85K words (around 330 pages)\n- audience: business professionals, crypto community, IT crowd\n- current status: 3/4 of the book is finished\n- expected publishing date: June 2020\n- the doc outlines marketing strategies to promote the book, including publishing some chapters for free, conference talks, podcasts, newsletter, crypto puzzle, social media content, sending free copies to selected influencers and selected educational institutions.\n\n#### Questions\n\n- How many pages the book is estimated to have and how many are already written (did it change since the original sponsorship proposal)?\n- How many pages will be dedicated to Decred?\n- How many pages will be dedicated to topics relevant for Decred such as sound money, governance, funding, skin in the game, giving the final say to those most exposed vs creating a yet another system where control is delegated to some group (e.g. miners), etc? (Decred [iterates](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/12/iterating-bitcoin/) Bitcoin in a big way and addresses its biggest [challenges](https://blog.companyzero.com/2015/11/bitcoins-biggest-challenges/))\n- To what extent the book talks about monetary policies, how fiat money printing is extracting value from the population, separating money from the state, and what triggered the creation of Bitcoin? In other words, to what extent the book conveys the spirit and goals of the cryptocurrency movement vs providing a historical reference?\n- Is it possible to include an interview with a Decred community member?\n- How technical the reader must be?\n- Have you published a book before?","signature":"baf49cc06a34da4679333cc7731f03088831fce07c6ee166912852d219809eea9ee4120cc5c33e8ba5fa3dce61656a518efdf1ded1c85cc10fa9b5034a4c590d","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"22","receipt":"cef454907c41f920860d5c76d96a339d7ae0f02154fb18370d013125e9c421b80954a31b0524413230256ab27367912bfb764460fdf45c01e1a1f8100cec6302","timestamp":1590862755,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As mentioned before, I am considering releasing the book fully for open. I haven't made my final decision yet. But at this point, I am leaning towards that option like 85% because I would like to reach the point when it would be updated by different crypto communities. \n\nRegarding your other questions:\n- I guess the approximate length will be 300 pages (still depends on the feedback from my alpha readers and editor) I estimate that content will be ready be and of June. \n- Given that I am trying to summarize the whole crypto history in 300 pages, I won 't go into details of many altcoins, my goal is to mention their key distinct features to and let the reader then decide which one she wants to explore more. Thus, DCR would be mentioned roughly on a half-page. \n- I am not focusing that much on monetary theories in the context of fiat, as I believe there are enough resources and books that elaborate on that. Still, as the book contains lots of quotes from different crypto builders and thinkers, including Cypherpunks, I believe it explores their narratives and conveys the message of why cryptocurrencies were created. \n- I would be happy do an interview with a Decred community member, even though I don't think I will manage to include it in the book. I want to go on with interviews also after the book is finished at Medium: [https://medium.com/coin-story](url). \n- I believe the book requires some pre-existing knowledge of the crypto space as I don't aim to explain all the concept into detail as , again, there are lots of great resources doing just that.\n- No, I have not published the book before. This whole thing is for me a huge experiment. I probably make lots of mistakes along the way. Therefore, I am very grateful for any feedback.\n\n","signature":"6d0d1612c9a3511cf5b94b32dea0e9762ba4799dd53c71e72a7b8d61992d8270bbba5502bdbb31243dbab87a2cb5ee7cd3bfa4af73b34d7c57465d9ab4de4109","publickey":"94926ba3db7d6013326665c24f850c798c077736680fbd2cc3d94996068531f2","commentid":"23","receipt":"c5f7cdd9cfbd2e44e7fe527d10ba48528a0de85a838e006c9142f9813844e7ce5a956a20f37252883d100d332dba9da7ee955088a5773eec938239174626ff02","timestamp":1590952798,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
