I will echo what Richard-Red notes, can you please clarify what is being asked of the Decred community and can you please present examples of the content covering Decred? It is typical that such work demonstrate value to the Decred project prior so gaining some more insight in what is on offer and the value add is appreciated.","signature":"83f4195098e4181ad38bd65dd16b6ca071e8b1dea7ae3c5a25b3137c384bcc7f20d669251b67335770bdc47fbb3d787862040fc33a02c78c0b3e9bdc8dc1d407","publickey":"bd0f6b20cb6665cf1f07725d75c81b3fa9752be3ba0c4136a143224b3c07f9dd","commentid":"3","receipt":"8286f9a4a26a4a66c17a77bfc44f371300f6d05c48026e1001855c4b1fe461e0d9a0e817e0c4e8872a9553569795a802c4d2c0679b1454ed1c01ffc9b0051502","timestamp":1589835934,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
