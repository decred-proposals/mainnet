CoinStory - The History and Evolution of Cryptocurrencies (Book)

**What**

This proposal would partially fund the costs of what I believe is the most complete book on the history and evolution of cryptocurrencies and gained visibility for Decred not only in the book but its website as well - https://coinstory.tech/

**Amount asked:** 1000 USD

What's in it for DCR: 
The book is quite complex and covers really a lot of stuff.  The goal of the book is to compile the whole story of cryptocurrencies, explain how things evolved in the context, and provide the reader with hints where to look further. Therefore, there is not much space to elaborate on each project into detail as there are many dozens of them mentioned in the book.

I do write about DCR in the Altcoin section in terms of its consensus algorithm, and I actually wanted to write about it more in the part focused on governance where I wanted to describe how cool is that even this book could get funded via treasury in a decentralized manner. 


**Why**

Even though there are many crypto books out there, they are mostly focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, and quite little is written about what preceded Bitcoin, and what followed after Bitcoin. Therefore, a few years ago I started to work on a book that would cover the whole story of cryptocurrencies starting with 1970s, through digital currencies in 1990s, till altcoins and Ethereum "killers", NFTs, DeFi etc.

The book provides very comprehend treatise on the evolution of cryptocurrency protocols and the ecosystem as a whole. It features interviews with some of the biggest names in the crypto space such as Andreas Antonopoulos, Peter Todd, Emin Gun Sirer, Sergio Lerner, Scott Stornetta, and others. I believe the book will be a very valuable source to learn from about crypto not only for beginners but also for crypto veterans. 

I intend to raise a smaller amount of money from different crypto projects to cover the costs of self-publishing, editing, formatting, and graphic works related to the book. Some of the chapters I would like to give away for free to the communities. 

I do write about Decred in the book regardless of the contribution of course. 

**How**

The book has been worked on for a couple of years and most of the chapters are done. They are being reviewed by alpha readers. Afterward, I incorporate the feedback and the book will get a final copy edit. 
I released the website already, where I publish all the interviews as blog posts. The website will feature also an extensive collection of educational resources on crypto, which can be collaboratively crowd-sourced by the community via Github. 

My plans is also to create a podcast based on the book.

**Who**

The proposal is made by David Stancel ( https://www.stanceldavid.sk/ ). I have been researching crypto since 2012, did first Bitcoin events since 2013, did my Master of Science in Digital Currencies at the University of Nicosia and I have been teaching cryptocurrencies at 2 universities -- Slovak University of Technology and the University of Economics in Slovakia.

I have made available my sponsorship proposal that I use to approach crypto companies, and it includes the first 2 (unedited) chapters from the book: https://www.stanceldavid.sk/book/

**When**

Most of the chapters are ready, the rest of the book should be finished and edited by the summer. I expect the release around September 2020.
