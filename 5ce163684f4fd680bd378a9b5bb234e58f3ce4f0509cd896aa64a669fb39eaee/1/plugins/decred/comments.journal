If I read this correctly the plan is essentially:\n\n- Prepare/expand  documentation and educational content to get new devs familiar with the Decred codebase.\n\n- Structure a standard Decred hackathon toolkit to minimise overheads in the future for redeployment.\n\n- Develop and deliver a few mini hackathons to prove the model above works.\n\nFirst up, I like the approach of investing in tools today to make for a more efficient and standardised deployment tomorrow. I also like the focus on developers and the content will be largely evergreen and reuseable. The team are well qualified having worked with pablito and nachito in the past. I personally don't have the dev experience to know how hackathons work but overall I feel that this is a sensible strategy at this stage in the market. I will be watching comments that come in to help formulate my vote but overall this is in alignment with the kind of proposal I am interested in seeing delivered.","signature":"710268feb5e38ab9a1473af8360c5f60f97e0d692fdfc90286a74c372c7434442c7bcb850cb23aaafe4bd0e4f474aad7a5fc1a2685aea968c4f014827c3a680d","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"0ba505b3e4d2ff73f8165a2d008b1d3b82e7d243380a5f9970526dfcccfcc5d2c4df22740780f51616158ba69a82d5afcc9cdb100fffb19fae2bc4acb62fbc00","timestamp":1607581551,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I noticed that bigger projects like Stellar, Zcash or Tezos all have some forms of _organized_ and _funded_ programs to attract developers. I did not study them closely, but it appears that such programs lead to a variety of apps getting developed for these ecosystems, plus it generates PR.\n\n### Notes\n\n\u003e higher level overviews of Decred mission and vision\n\nThat never hurts and can help with the \"keep the community together\" aspect. \"We're working to unrig the money game\" may not be a flashy message (because it is risky and requires years/decades of work) but I think we can onboard more long-term builders if it is presented clearly and in the right places.\n\n\u003e Small challenges that require dev submitting new code as a PR to the challenge repo\n\nI would like to redirect interested-enough devs to our product repos as soon as they are trained enough to contribute. Coding challenge tasks is fun and creative (writing from scratch, generating new ideas), but working on real, \"in-service\" projects has strong advantages.\n\nFirst is that you get existing project leads and maintainers serving as judges and code reviewers, because they are interested in contributions to their projects. What is needed here is a balance to not send too-unprepared devs that will slow down the development.\n\nSecond advantage is contributions that get merged to working products will start serving people in the next release and one could say \"heard of Decred v1.7 release? I fixed 20 bugs in it and developed this feature!\". In contrast, contest projects have a high chance to be abandoned and not help anyone.\n\nThird advantage is contributing to products is the best way to build up one's reputation, become a contractor and get a DCC.\n\nFourth advantage is building a real product and interacting with our developers is a great way to learn. I learned a lot and still do, and this atmosphere is a key factor in keeping me addicted.\n\nFinally, re \"community could vote on the next challenge (the tools they would like to see made)\" first of all I would like to see more forces focused on testing and improving our main products.\n\n### Questions\n\n1\\. What are your thoughts/strategies on maximizing the amount of hackathon outputs that end up bringing value? E.g. \"directing devs to our repos sooner\" above is one strategy, but another is to ensure that hackathon projects end up \"surviving\" and helping someone.\n\n2\\. In the \"build a playbook\" and \"prove that it works and pays off\" I am especially interested in the second part. Historically, I have seen similar efforts developing playbooks that were not getting used, e.g. I am not seeing people quoting [Foundational Messaging](https://github.com/decredcommunity/outreach/blob/release/foundational-messaging.md) or the [Community Organizer](https://github.com/decredcommunity/guidelines/blob/master/community-organizer-playbook.md) playbook. The only way to ensure that your playbook is reusable is to battle test it by having other people/teams use it for real and give feedback. Because it can take time or not happen at all, the main outcome I would like to see from this proposal is not the assets but executed engagements. Having a stunning playbook not used by anyone would be sad. In contrast, if you host e.g. 3 fun hackathons I would not be too upset if the supporting assets end up not getting used outside your team.","signature":"ab1be31201f5c344b27c9e89d8ac1b3674f8a074f74dac6a73128ed6afbad180c3224b3b99e716926154704f2251710afc4d4f0524868e2e5d3bb11583ce2504","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"4","receipt":"71e7cedfbce2cad94439e3e0d8eca596a0b60b25bb2b6b1d9ca93328c5e2a2a7aac65bb0ac050d1365d2c03e9a534054050a40b37cacedaa66b3ec5acfe05c0f","timestamp":1608488039,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
