If I read this correctly the plan is essentially:\n\n- Prepare/expand  documentation and educational content to get new devs familiar with the Decred codebase.\n\n- Structure a standard Decred hackathon toolkit to minimise overheads in the future for redeployment.\n\n- Develop and deliver a few mini hackathons to prove the model above works.\n\nFirst up, I like the approach of investing in tools today to make for a more efficient and standardised deployment tomorrow. I also like the focus on developers and the content will be largely evergreen and reuseable. The team are well qualified having worked with pablito and nachito in the past. I personally don't have the dev experience to know how hackathons work but overall I feel that this is a sensible strategy at this stage in the market. I will be watching comments that come in to help formulate my vote but overall this is in alignment with the kind of proposal I am interested in seeing delivered.","signature":"710268feb5e38ab9a1473af8360c5f60f97e0d692fdfc90286a74c372c7434442c7bcb850cb23aaafe4bd0e4f474aad7a5fc1a2685aea968c4f014827c3a680d","publickey":"0ac5336fbe5899a61b1d6fa902c144582c9ae6d296c4cc4fbb235a1e960e27bb","commentid":"1","receipt":"0ba505b3e4d2ff73f8165a2d008b1d3b82e7d243380a5f9970526dfcccfcc5d2c4df22740780f51616158ba69a82d5afcc9cdb100fffb19fae2bc4acb62fbc00","timestamp":1607581551,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
