I would like this to pass on to the voting stage, at least after a few more stakeholders chip in with their views, in order to get a better estimate on both costs and contractors.\n\nConversely, given that the bulk of ATMs are based in the North American continent, an alternative effort could be collaborating with Point of Sale terminal companies which cater to a larger number of geographies, and potentially wider network effects.

I remember, for instance, being new to crypto, and buying LTC without knowing anything about it, simply because it appeared on Coinbase. That was a good decision. I don't think you're going to get the full on \"Coinbase effect\" here, but I do think DCR being on a platform with a wide reach raises awareness and credibility, and could lead people to buy a little just to speculate. \n\nI'm not in a position to estimate how much this usage will raise the price of DCR in the long run, but the cost does seem very reasonable considering the amount of work.

I am not sure how much use they get in mostly cashless economies. There are barely any in countries that are cash heavy and only 3 in whole of Africa, where people have actually shown inclination towards an quick fiat exchange with no other options.\n\nNow that we have been listed on Vertbase and they are looking to expand in EU, i see very little to gain from getting onto the ATMs which are obviously less convenient option and probably a high risk one due to need of physical presence. Also if they do get any usage (which i am skecptical about) then it will just divert away the liquidity from Vertbase. I think if we can rather show enough volume on Vertbase, that is visible/reported at least as opposed ATM volume which as issac says was not available/reported, then we can make a good case for listing on other exchanges.\n\nApart from that many people have talked about, (anecdotal evidence from bitcoin) high fees/margins/spreads, privacy infringement via camera and non-working/missing ATMs while being shown on the map, as problems.\n\nI think there is very little to gain from getting listed on ATMs especially at a price point of $10-20K. I would be voting against this proposal unless someone can show some stats about volume and state a case where ATMs will be better than Vertbase. I am assuming that both require KYC.","signature":"c77e53f8e9ab7260d1aabc763bfe1f766b4cf445e6559f27dd788fd183367eba946391b79b54c8e388bf80ce3446bf4e0b901f5a1c629eee16cb9b388406c400","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"21","receipt":"b158889839cd408ac6f3eca2abd858114bbe0ada6f66181c65b09eba5c2882f8f2f4ad1fef3e58661b936ba662f687902c2eb1decc92e72ba86c50d981b07603","timestamp":1551026266,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
