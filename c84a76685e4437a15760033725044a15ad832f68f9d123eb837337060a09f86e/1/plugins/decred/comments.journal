However, I think parts of this should be split off into smaller proposals.\n\nThe website redesign/updates won't be a regular, recurring thing (i.e. we don't expect to do the same thing again in 2020), so it seems that should be a separate proposal, with more detail.\n\nAlso, I would prefer if each of the community organizers submitted their own budget, with further details on what they're specifically doing.\n\nIf the stakeholders are to properly manage treasury funds, there must be transparency in how they're spent. With the possible exception of your Discretionary Spending budget, the other items not mentioned earlier seem very clear and transparent, but for the items mentioned above, it seems like we're throwing money at vague ideas, and this could quickly develop into an opaque bureaucracy.\n\nThank you for all the work you do, and for taking the time to submit this proposal.","signature":"bb25c71ebdab0971bcfba110dd507b3ca3e588c4283d2f46c58aba010fb1fd698c754001ccd8d5e4aaf7812fd8ff782a30d5d7b5a748a71fdbbec92ac2ec9209","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"7","receipt":"9af930eb24f36490f1e6975a8d1650716f13a4d2881f20ec90a229ba22ab2dfcb7c918472563bf57dfeb5de87caec143c6560f1442b33dca7f6ffc8e8dbca106","timestamp":1550799678,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There is no dearth of contractors willing to work provided the system gives them the chance. The payment terms are also quite stringent and the process to hire contractors needs reform. No one will work happily under such dire conditions.  Dash pays contractors upfront via blockchain- while this may not be the best way it certainly ensures an open, encouraging and democratic system. \n\nb) Because of a) we are going to be forced to handover large funds to one or two core team members which is a pretty limited pool to select from and smacks of centralization.

Most of the elements we see in this proposal are for types of work that are already being done and for which funding was allowed from the treasury by the DHG during the last 3 years.\n\nI don't believe either that this proposal is the \"final level\" of decentralization that we hope to achieve. This proposal is however a clear shift in transparency and an important transition from the DHG management of the treasury. The key word here being \"transition\".\n\nI also have a few concerns regarding the content of this proposal, although I understand the complexity of shifting how funding is managed and the implications for people already in place and currently at work.\n\nFrom my experience when you have people who do excellent work, are productive and autonomous in your team, the last thing you want is to micro-manage them. Rather, you want to trust them and let them strive for greatness because that's when you get the most out of them. \n\nMy first concern is on the timeframe of a full year, I would hope we eventually turn to more frequent and standard periods (like quarterly) for most stakeholder's budget approvals. I say most,  because there are a few domains where annual review would certainly be enough and make more sense. As we are in uncharted territory here, a year long period is a safer, although slower transition IMO.\n\nMy second concern is regarding the grouping of multiple elements in the same proposal. It does make sense for a marketing plan as a whole, but it does open the door to having more difficult votes if some elements are more \"controversial\" than others or if stakeholder see less benefits in an item.\n\nFor example: To me the Decred Assembly, Newsletter, Website updates, Podcasts, and Internship are no-brainers and budgets are within what we would expect of quality content for these types of work. For the other elements however, it's a lot harder for stakeholders to decide if budget is adequate and to envision what actual work will be done. I would be much more comfortable with a shorter timeframe for these elements.\n\nAs a side note, I could see future proposals presenting a year-ahead plan and budget like this, but requesting ~quarterly payments in follow-up proposals where stakeholders can evaluate progress and actual spending. That would most probably alleviate my concerns, and leave room to adjustments if needed, while keeping a way for increasing/lowering budgets or adding/removing elements, if conditions change during the year.","signature":"d1a1e96fd8e825de8c53290117085c84d798b97b40a506acab70bd2870b6f79e8000f73d658ae52bd02a205853424f90dc9a4a7f388fe4fc6a88a2f1090b0f0f","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"13","receipt":"4648096edb9d02544f6edf1e1dfe3865763632952788b7b9ae03cc0c07bdacc76036b69f3d0f53aa75bb650fc0918d27b0b2acc7f0be128009df272fbab0a808","timestamp":1550896526,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If I'm wrong someone can correct me,  but this proposal would not hand over the total amount to an individual or put someone in a deciding position.  It's the exact opposite....\n\nMy understanding,  is that all work described in this proposal,  would be billed at an hourly rate by each community member to the upcoming DCC platform.  (Instead of the DHG). In the DCC platform, contractors in all fields, review work being done by their peers before payment is made. The goal is to eventually see all those steps including payment, automated, with no manual intervention in the treasury from the DHG.\n\nThis change explicitly remove gatekeepers to the treasury while giving autonomy to contractors, and ensuring peer review of every little detail being worked on (without involving stakeholders in micro-management of daily hours).\n\nThis method is a clear step towards removing individuals from power position, and having the collective stakeholders and contractors, manage this decentralized organization efficiently. It will definitely be harder and (eventually impossible) for someone to \"run with the money\"  after those changes, than it was in the last 3 years.\n\nAlso, as all work need to be billed to the DCC, costs represents the total budget cap allowed by stakeholders and not the actual payment directly given to each person involved. If the work done and validated by peers on the website, end up to 40K$ at the end of the year,  nobody will have the possibility of leaving away with the remaining 25K$. Work still need  to be billed to the DCC and reviewed by peers before any payment goes out.\n\nAll parts of the puzzle may not be in place yet,  but I believe it's where we're going. Am I right ?","signature":"ff0d2c58ad95ba4fd3fb1bb6acd7346c7b3eef3e561873dd3683736b8c79344a06d6ac11938363cef3d18640f31288cd26a5b0daf945d563d6a6234c00d02003","publickey":"0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","commentid":"15","receipt":"507e054dbd110e4ee6518a583cb6c9d3986a6994e0fd84c296e43bfc4663628f8ae860aa148469881460522baef4827a28ab4a051ea318ca1322b454af309403","timestamp":1550925775,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think the key thing here is people should see these proposal as moving away from DHG to multiple contributors who manage different domains like marketing, events, development, research etc. I think that for future these types of proposals should be presented as \"Proposal for Marketing Management for 2019\", as this is clearly what it is.\n\nWe have seen a natural hierarchy develop in most areas where some people are more dedicated, experienced and talented and eventually start co-ordinating activities and other contributors seem happy to look up to them for guidance and advice. Some examples are bee(data management/information gathering), dustorf(Marketing), richardred(Research), davecgh(cryptocurrency fundamentals/programming \u0026 education). I think this is decentralization at work, devolving power away from one entity (c0/DHG) to multiple individual/corporate contractors.\n\nIt is exciting to see new people come in and fill the gaps. I think although people will balk at the term middle management but that is what has emerged naturally over time and we should probably formalize it with such transparent proposals.\n\nMore on the proposal in a top level comment.","signature":"6ac9c1cb4416399b5e0f012b196089a0c7043950235363c52326d15575c96c7dd2dbbeef5af31e1c2aafd29a28999174f35b8d0ebcbad381cc6ed946204a680c","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"16","receipt":"e567815b5bc93dca5f302fd33e90cd0e8555a4ab728a6856c3b72c2bb4be5559e167e734cd1f532f1a224b189a33aeed1d24692035a289e67b4dec9cf4fc8409","timestamp":1550946474,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As others have suggested i think a quarterly review proposal that lets people vote on each of line item will be a good idea. It would be great if it is put up by dustorf himself, otherwise i think anyone who is not happy can put a proposal to remove any line item, as the money will not be paid until the item is produced/delivered. Also i would suggest for future proposal to list the management cost as a line item which would be paid to the proposer for co-ordinating different line items. This will provide more transparency and formalize the management job that a proposer has to do.","signature":"967c790616328d36942bfbdbdc07cfc9134bf3954e9e197999f5b510b012e92792d9fb8b6cb66d96fcdded23d54491d42c953de6361709b23654fe41e9aa5002","publickey":"8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","commentid":"17","receipt":"7926ee0d306d520c71b447db3baf487a71ce43c4d3f01e7d51b871da47225168f3a802d9b98f4ba449dee799ebfa1e2b212371e8ee7492e08ea7f4bd1958b405","timestamp":1550946912,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

On the other, it does look very centralized and noncompetitive. Without competition, anyone can join in and quote what they like.\n\nAt the very least, each section should have a further breakdown on costs. \nThis should be a rule for Politeia. For instance. 3.5k per Decred Assembly. How much goes to the studio? If the figure is above 2k, understandable. If it is less than 2k, probably not. The point is you have to be completely transparent and not vague.\n\nThe same goes for the website and supplementary. 65k and 70k.\nLooking at supplementary, how much per each person/contributor? The same for the website? Can you be more specific? How do we know this will be spent responsibly if it is this vague.\n\nTactic\tNumber\tCost Per (USD)\tExtended Cost (USD)\nDecred Assembly\t10\t3,500\t35,000.00\nWebsite Updates\t1\t65,000\t65,000.00\nSupplementary/New Opps\t1\t70,000\t70,000\n\nThese bullet points should have sub-bullets. It is way too vague and Decred cannot be taken seriously throwing around big numbers with so little scrutiny. (I love Decred but want it to be sustainable! The way this proposal was written gives me serious doubts)","signature":"372c8bccdf461dabb0a53a2869aa584ee3830883355eb9b7c03d132cc982f06523d7cd27ed39f7054ba61c6fe8a9e3abba6d6bef51934c38f736fe59b1621308","publickey":"b23de44909614c81f567a3c14a223a023c092bed742ae511c031adeb7509e8d8","commentid":"18","receipt":"a13ab0078a0584c5ee28751c03f7a73884a303665b88219a2ef4954228c677a1a4656819bfbb3fe95f328aa21d635b0f96c9430edba8f51da1c3ba117832b909","timestamp":1550969273,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
