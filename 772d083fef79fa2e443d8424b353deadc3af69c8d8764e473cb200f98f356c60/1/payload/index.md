Altonomy - Market Making Proposal for Decred


# Altonomy - Market Making Proposal for Decred


&nbsp;


### I. Background

[Altonomy](http://www.altonomy.com) is a trading, advisory and asset management firm specializing in cryptocurrency and digital assets. It is the first-ever dedicated sell-side trading desk to provide institutional-grade liquidity solutions, OTC trading, advisory and asset management services under one roof. We currently cover all major exchanges and provide 24/7 consistent service. 

&nbsp;

### II. Our Goal
  1. For emerging projects like DCR, the most important goal for market makers is to price the trading pairs as fast and as accurate as possible. That is, to provide a narrow market spread (highest bid price and lowest ask price) with enough depth to facilitate retail investors buying and selling.  

  2. The second goal is to maintain healthy orderbook with 100% up time especially in extreme market volatility, which will reduce the slippage.

&nbsp;

### III. Market Analysis

According to our goals we mentioned above, we did some primitive market analysis of top six pairs listing on leading exchanges like _Binance_ and _Huobi_ according to trading volume on July 28th, 2019.
(__+/-#%__ stands for the cumulative order sizes up or down to the __#%__ from the best bid/ask.


| Exchange | Pair | Avg-spread | -5% | -2% | -1% | +1% | +2% | +5% | 24h Volume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/DCR_BTC) | DCR/BTC | 0.31% | $35,529 | $18,675 | $7,810 | $4,132 | $12,612 | $28,175 | $177,982 |
| [Huobi](https://www.hbg.com/en-us/dcr_btc/exchange/) | DCR/BTC | 0.48% | $24,089 | $21,141 | $10,250 | $5,520 | $6,010 | $6,238 | $76,687 |
| [Huobi](https://www.hbg.com/en-us/dcr_usdt/exchange/) | DCR/USDT | `0.67%` | $12,350 | $8,731 | `$6,210` | `$2,974` | $6,917 | $7,190 | $35,882 |
| [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-DCR) | DCR/BTC | 0.32% | $24,010 | $20,417 | $8,243 | $3,877 | $7,766 | $11,216 | $27,683 |
| [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/trade) | DCR/BTC | `1.49%` | $678 | $441 | `$112` | `$164` | $876 | $1,041 | $6,684 |
| [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/market?product=dcr_usdt) | DCR/USDT | `0.70%` | $1,453 | $551 | `$270` | `$378` | $514 | $670 | $4,160 |

_Table 1: DCR market analysis on July 28th, 2019._

As it shows above, even though the market spreads are good on _Binance_ and _Bittrex_, it is still too wide on _Huobi_, _OKEx_ and especially, _Kucoin_. On the other hand, the market depth are also far from satisfaction among these exchanges.


Under these circumstances, retailers are less intended to trade DCR since they cannot get a decent price, and it is easier to cause huge market movement with shallow orderbook depth.


&nbsp;

### IV. Solutions

Our solutions to improve DCR liquidity are:


  1. Maintain better market spread, especially when market volatility is huge, our market making strategy will allow us to recover spread within __milliseconds__ following large market orders that took a great portion of liquidity away.
  2. Provide higher orderbook depth, especially for some exchanges with limited depth. Similarly, our high-frequency trading strategy will promise a __24/7__ consistent market existence, which will to some degree reduce slippage as well.
