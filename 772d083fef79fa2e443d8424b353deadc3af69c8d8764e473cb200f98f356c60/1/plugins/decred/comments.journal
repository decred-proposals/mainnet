I will echo my comments from the GFRT proposal. It would be preferable in my opinion if the DCR borrow costs were rolled into this proposal and we were presented with one number for cost. With Altonomy then compensating the lender directly.\n\nWe will also need a ceiling for the \"trading fee reimbursement\". That max should be rolled into the final number as well.","signature":"ec090f32a329f20475576f2f4cfdfe5c136d7b7c8f3a831612b9e46548d8a10e329eb9115a5b18248410c21762fc1c866d4991e2114b1de04c2fb9353dfacb00","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"1","receipt":"b659a88eaa879cd5b7d7466891454f3c267169cf8ff693dea007622be2a6b71336178d46e2639c04bf21c6cf666b8a34d532107c4e4b23cede6cea2bbe008d08","timestamp":1565205611,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
