I will echo my comments from the GFRT proposal. It would be preferable in my opinion if the DCR borrow costs were rolled into this proposal and we were presented with one number for cost.

That max should be rolled into the final number as well.","signature":"ec090f32a329f20475576f2f4cfdfe5c136d7b7c8f3a831612b9e46548d8a10e329eb9115a5b18248410c21762fc1c866d4991e2114b1de04c2fb9353dfacb00","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"1","receipt":"b659a88eaa879cd5b7d7466891454f3c267169cf8ff693dea007622be2a6b71336178d46e2639c04bf21c6cf666b8a34d532107c4e4b23cede6cea2bbe008d08","timestamp":1565205611,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
