Sorry we didn't make it clear in our proposal.\n\nIntuitively, we __can__ make profits with our market making strategies by buying low from one client and selling high to another client because our high frequency strategy can make decisions within milliseconds, much faster than normal people especially when market moves a lot.\n\nHowever, the profit we gain is generated from the market, which means, we take profits from you, from the Decred community. The more profits we gain, the more money you guys lose. \n\nWe're here to help Decred communities, to let more people involve and let those who got interested recently can get a chance to have their own DCR tokens and join the community. It's not fair for them to pay a higher price and lose money, that is why we decide to gain __$0 profit__ from the market.\n\nWe are able to set a goal to maximize our profits in the short term, but we do not think it is the best way in the longer term. So we choose to charge a certain amount of service fee and provide the best service we can provide to the whole community.\n\nThanks,\nAltonomy","signature":"7f68bffe3efed837f26c49416b3f506c89ee3ea8fba192fe72adf506124ce625946e054e70594a747134df00a13550a0d6546eb767b69c6dbf5d75a5e65ba80c","publickey":"0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","commentid":"7","receipt":"b70f880cd2385e47904f36217578071d4ace44c02761d56f29faa46ac5d43b430f6a9d1acb060a7d6ce5bbfe752a71f7c7f76b2f1c9ba6f3965afe0172918b04","timestamp":1565280579,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let me introduce some basic ideas about Market Making.\n\n1.\nThe situation you described in your first question, is basically called ___orderbook depth___, which means how much DCR or USD you would like to trade in the market. Let's say if there're 100 people, each of them would like to buy 100 DCR at a price of $25, then in this case, you are promised to sell 10,000 DCR with a price higher than $25. However, if there're only 10 people would like to buy 100 DCR, you cannot get a price higher than $25 with the same amount of DCR. \n\nThis is exactly the circumstance you described, if a person want to buy DCR with over 1M USD, it will be pretty hard to get a decent price (please look at table 1 in our proposal). You would see huge pumps and dumps in the market, which is not healthy for the whole community.\n\nIn order to improve it, we promise to provide better orderbook depth, to let people who interested in DCR are willing to do their investment. (please look at table 2 in our proposal). It will provide a more stable and reliable market with lower investment risk, and attract more investors.\n\n---\n\n2.\nThe 'ugly' you mentioned in the article is mainly about wash trading. What is wash trading? A market maker trades with itself, let's say, buy DCR with their own USD and then sell the same amount of DCR to USD. No clients will benefit from these fake tradings. This will generate fake volume and people will believe that the market is pretty hot and there're lots of active investors in the market, which is totally a fraud. \n\nAs a 'good' market maker, we promise to only provide liquidity, that is, we only __passively post__ our orders to the market but we will never __actively take__ any orders from the market. \n\n---\n3.\nWe are proud to have pretty wide connections in the cryptocurrency world, we are the top tier market maker among top tier exchanges, and some other second tier exchanges. Our strategies are able to provide liquidity over __10M__ a day, and can handle various circumstances 24/7 consistently.\n\nAsides from exchanges, we have helped tens of clients for their ICO and market making program, some of them are the hottest project in recent months. \n\nIt is our honor to grow up with those teams like Decred, and we are confident to provide better market for emerging projects. Good teams deserve the best service.\n\nYou can simply google us and learn more about us. We're happy to make more friends in crypto world. ^_^","signature":"57c3bf6e3418d0f704a88168c9089c6ddef8f4c641458b843d454ca87290cb34ba45f2eb88af95c27d9a48e68bae2422ba27437696f2bc4b714e08d9c31c6907","publickey":"0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","commentid":"8","receipt":"0734055c1473b1e6e454c46d588ffa9f1bac8c73353eb9481ca8dadacc20c0922f4467448660dbcce2fd0d6f42bc57bc273937532528fe29274342d808f46a04","timestamp":1565282688,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
