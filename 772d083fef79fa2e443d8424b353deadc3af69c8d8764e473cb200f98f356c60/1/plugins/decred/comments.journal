Sorry we didn't make it clear in our proposal.\n\nIntuitively, we __can__ make profits with our market making strategies by buying low from one client and selling high to another client because our high frequency strategy can make decisions within milliseconds, much faster than normal people especially when market moves a lot.\n\nHowever, the profit we gain is generated from the market, which means, we take profits from you, from the Decred community. The more profits we gain, the more money you guys lose. \n\nWe're here to help Decred communities, to let more people involve and let those who got interested recently can get a chance to have their own DCR tokens and join the community.

Let me introduce some basic ideas about Market Making.\n\n1.\nThe situation you described in your first question, is basically called ___orderbook depth___, which means how much DCR or USD you would like to trade in the market. Let's say if there're 100 people, each of them would like to buy 100 DCR at a price of $25, then in this case, you are promised to sell 10,000 DCR with a price higher than $25. However, if there're only 10 people would like to buy 100 DCR, you cannot get a price higher than $25 with the same amount of DCR. \n\nThis is exactly the circumstance you described, if a person want to buy DCR with over 1M USD, it will be pretty hard to get a decent price (please look at table 1 in our proposal). You would see huge pumps and dumps in the market, which is not healthy for the whole community.\n\nIn order to improve it, we promise to provide better orderbook depth, to let people who interested in DCR are willing to do their investment. (please look at table 2 in our proposal). It will provide a more stable and reliable market with lower investment risk, and attract more investors.\n\n---\n\n2.\nThe 'ugly' you mentioned in the article is mainly about wash trading. What is wash trading? A market maker trades with itself, let's say, buy DCR with their own USD and then sell the same amount of DCR to USD. No clients will benefit from these fake tradings. This will generate fake volume and people will believe that the market is pretty hot and there're lots of active investors in the market, which is totally a fraud. \n\nAs a 'good' market maker, we promise to only provide liquidity, that is, we only __passively post__ our orders to the market but we will never __actively take__ any orders from the market. \n\n---\n3.\nWe are proud to have pretty wide connections in the cryptocurrency world, we are the top tier market maker among top tier exchanges, and some other second tier exchanges. Our strategies are able to provide liquidity over __10M__ a day, and can handle various circumstances 24/7 consistently.\n\nAsides from exchanges, we have helped tens of clients for their ICO and market making program, some of them are the hottest project in recent months. \n\nIt is our honor to grow up with those teams like Decred, and we are confident to provide better market for emerging projects. Good teams deserve the best service.\n\nYou can simply google us and learn more about us. We're happy to make more friends in crypto world. ^_^","signature":"57c3bf6e3418d0f704a88168c9089c6ddef8f4c641458b843d454ca87290cb34ba45f2eb88af95c27d9a48e68bae2422ba27437696f2bc4b714e08d9c31c6907","publickey":"0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","commentid":"8","receipt":"0734055c1473b1e6e454c46d588ffa9f1bac8c73353eb9481ca8dadacc20c0922f4467448660dbcce2fd0d6f42bc57bc273937532528fe29274342d808f46a04","timestamp":1565282688,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Could you estimate how much trading fees will cost per month or for the 6 month term? Could you put a cap on the amount the Treasury would be charged for?\n1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.\n1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. I notice on your website that the logos of Grin and I think Cardano are floating around, does that mean you have been engaged to provide this kind of service for GRIN and ADA markets?\n1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org\u0026via=matrix.org\u0026via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?\n1. You refer to the details of what would be provided as \"tentative metrics\" - what happens if you don't hit those targets?\n1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $35k/month (including onboarding fee) seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.\n1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms. As jz has also suggested, I would prefer that the lending costs be incorporated within this proposal.","signature":"aea6df2edd9d236fdfb89a29619d7bcc66b0fad4934d41e71daa60866c8a046db58490555832f0ceb898969f0adecd56dda3e7dc13a7d5bc54c54730de49760f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"11","receipt":"37288478cf4d2d7e1f45b9bfc018183237298e4a78a758384c8d41de65ef3ea9bd9ede187b89bd12b73c3b2de7a1ef794f25b443571bdb7b7e94196f58b77e0e","timestamp":1565295241,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The reason why people do wash trading is to attract more investors to pump the token price, and they can become billionaires overnight. It will greatly harm the communities especially those who truly believe the ideas for this project.\n\nHow to identify wash trading? The simplest way is to look at the daily or hourly volume. Altonomy is a liquidity provider, which will only post our orders to the market rather than take the order and make transaction. If nobody trade with us, we won't produce any volume. In this case, you will witness a stable and gradually growing volume rather than flooding.\n\nAnother method is to look at the trade history, if most trades happened within the market spread, which means best bid and best ask didn't cross, we can confidently say they are wash trades.\n\nWe can provide a healthy market, where you can make your transactions easily with better price (the best bid price will be as close as possible to the best ask price). The price movement will be more stable to reduce the investment loss of everybody. A good market maker can maintain a solid market like ballast stone. Without market makers, the market will be easily driven by good news or bad news, for emerging projects the price movement will be huge ( imagine the price goes up 100% or goes down 50% when you are asleep). \n\n\nWe believe the potentials of Decred as we believed Beam and Grin a year ago, that is why we decide to work together with the whole community.","signature":"7b54f3fb6c9e7e555f31b281ddd7e509d3412a9f8638453ddbc4be1ff8aa80c562b044db0918ff79b25d703528423ed052215954543cd76a95dd341a5dc77d09","publickey":"0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","commentid":"12","receipt":"8a768c987f2882b94bd18b03fb87ac5811164e3dd8b23ef401b1094755d2fa1b3d5e27da04cb1ee39601fb1fd3f5d8e0bb51d7f62a44318663cc7417646cd60d","timestamp":1565297510,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let me explain it in details.\n\nDecred is at a very early stage, we agree with you, but we have already seen its potentials: DCR has already launched some of the largest exchanges, a pretty stable price, a growing community and a couple of millions daily volume.\n\nHowever, we have seen a lot of examples of market manipulations, even for some very good projects. The price was controlled by a small group of people rather than the whole community, in the end most people lost faith in the project and nobody would get involve with it anymore. Extreme market movement will damage a project at its early stage.\n\nWe are not only providing liquidity, but also providing faith. Not matter how much DCR price has changed, we will always be there (as we signed the contract). We can be the last guy you can find in the market to trade with. We provide liquidity and provide our protect to stabilize the market and maintain a healthy and sustainable growth of Decred community.\n\nEven though the service fee, as you mentioned, is expensive, we believe Decred deserve the best service, and we provided the world-class service to lots of teams at this price level.

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning. \n\nA) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250\nFINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process.\nRule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but\nnot limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and\n(3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act.\nThe prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4\nFINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:\n                 \n2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. \n Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow.  The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow.  If Grapefruit provides such amazing service.  Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.\n\n3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.  \nFirst, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service.  Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation.  Once again if Grapefruit can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great.  The community should know more about Grapefruit and their service.  We look forward to seeing a list.\nSecondly, why would I give a market market maker a free  put / call to trade around?  That is what that $30,000 a month is - it is a option for Grapefruit to trade around their own book.  If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.  \n\n4) A Potential Project Killer-  \n    As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say.  The regulators know a few things really well.  First, they know trading.  Second, they understand markets and market mechanics.  A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not.  Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project.  Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time.  What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation.  Say goodbye to the Treasury.  Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left.  The answer is no.  Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.  \n\nSecondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated.

Pretty straight forward if you ask me). I see MMs importance for the market and start to understand MMs POV better now.\n1 you mentioned MMs can profit due to speed advantage over retail. And from what i read there is no way for outsiders to verify that MM trades at break even. Is that correct? \n2 Also is there a way to spot or confirm if MM trades against his own order book with a different account? Basically we can not confirm MM is providing liquidity and isnt taking it?\n3 Can MM potentially misbehave and damage Decreds name and rep?

I believe no one will promise he will 100% making money using his market making strategies, otherwise he will become the richest person in the world. The most important metric for a market maker is about the spread, how close the spread you can provide, which stands for how much benefit you can bring to retailers. Idealy the best spread should be zero, because for a certain product its value is fixed, the buy price and sell price should be identical. This is the circumstance when no market maker can make money from the market. \nIn this case I would say, in general, the closer spread we provide the less profit we gain. That is the reason why we put __spread__ as our No.1 metrics.\n2. As I said, the simplest way to identify fake trades is to see if trades happened within the market spread. If so, we are comfortable to say it is a wash trade, because you didn't provide any liquidity to the retailers who really want to trade.\n3. Based on my knowledge, I don't think market making will damage reputation of Decred to any extent. Let alone crypto market, MM is so common in the __equity market__, even Apple and Google have their market makers providing liquidity to their stakeholders. I don't think MM is a bad thing, on the contrary, it is a symbol of a sophisticated market.","signature":"72618cff62130b2492df9ccf216eb9cf54bbd0da60becb9dba22fd6ee842b45f3f9dc5c27cf0e0e9fa9e0d024e9640ba55164df8da4e502c58e9df6542e2060a","publickey":"0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","commentid":"18","receipt":"5362665e5761d65aa020cee83864417cf1bf98f040dcbe6ab3b7a68621cc05145426b169cb3a6240434cdd9c31d5567df4e9185dc85012797994c8e0293b4308","timestamp":1565375439,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Yes we can do a rough estimation about how much daily volume we can provide. But like I said, we cannot provide a specific number at this stage because we do not know how our strategies will perform. I have received several comments like this one and we will for sure consider setting a upper limit for the trading fee reimbursement.\n2. Yes we have provided MM service to tens of projects and exchanges.\n3. Thanks for visiting our website, and your guess is right. We did cooperate with Grin at very early stage. You can google it if you are interested.\n4. This is a pretty good advice and we will probably publish another separate post or comment to address this concern.\n5. These metrics will be included in the legal contract, we will absolutely get punished if we fail to reach a satisfactory level. Besides, it will hurt our Altonomy reputation, which we don't want to see.\n6. I understand your concerns richard.   \nFirstly I would like to clarify is that, setting up market making strategy is far from an easy task. Since DCR has been trading across various exchanges and we have to set different accounts and handle various exchange exceptions. There are tons of different exceptions you may encounter if you are familiar with these exhcanges. It is quite a burden for our team to have everything running smoothly 24/7, and that's why we charge onboarding fee. \n7.
