i2 Trading: DCR Market Making




# i2 Trading DCR Designated Market Maker Proposal



### About i2 Trading:

Founded in 2016, Iterative Capital is an alternative investment manager with a focus on large-scale Decred and Bitcoin mining. In 2018 it launched i2 Trading, a wholesale cryptocurrency dealer with offices in New Jersey, London, and Hong Kong, which has grown to over $500M in monthly notional trading volume. The firm is noted in the DCR community for the Iterative Capital [**investment thesis**](http://iterative.capital/thesis), which provided new justification for Decred&#39;s dual-consensus design. In addition to providing liquidity in the OTC market, Iterative Capital operates the 4th-largest DCR Voting Service Provider and mining pool operator [**Megapool**](https://www.megapool.info/). In summary, the Iterative companies are the largest stakeholders in the DCR network and its infrastructure of any potential market-maker.

### Mission:

All liquid asset classes benefit from market-making, but Decred especially so. The Decred community&#39;s strong confidence in the project means that  roughly 50% of outstanding tokens are staked at any given time, and thus unavailable for trading; the result is poor liquidity.  Without deep markets, investors large and small are reluctant to invest into DCR and suffer substantial slippage costs. We are confident that by providing a tighter and deeper market, the DCR ecosystem can grow faster and buyers and sellers will be able to transact with much greater ease.

### Current State of DCR Market:

_Observed on July 30th, 2019_

| **Exchange** | **Pair** | **24-hr Volume** | **Average Spread** | **5 BTC/$50k Buy Slippage** | **5 BTC/$50k Sell Slippage** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Binance | DCR/BTC | 20 BTC | 0.38% | 6.93% | 8.03% |
| Bittrex | DCR/BTC | 7 BTC | 0.45% | 7.38% | 14.78% |
| Bittrex | DCR/USDT | 3k USDT | 6.73% | 40%+ | 40%+ |
| Huobi | DCR/BTC | 5 BTC | 0.52% | 25%+ | 25%+ |
| Huobi | DCR/USDT | 35k USDT | 0.73% | 50%+ | 50%+ |
| OkCoin | DCR/USD | < 0.5 BTC | 0.31% | 50%+ | 50%+ |

_Slippage columns imply how much the market price would be adversely affected by a Buy/Sale of a 5 BTC market order_

### Liquidity Proposal:

- Maintain a tight average market spread: 0.3% for BTC pairs, and .5% for USDT/USD pairs
  - A tight top of book spread is integral for DCR to increase mass market usage
- Layered Quotes provide increased depth and reduced slippage
  - 1 BTC ($10k) per side within +/-1% of best bid and offer (BBO)
  - 3 BTC ($30k) per side within +/-2% of BBO
  - 5 BTC ($50k) per side within +/-4% of BBO
- 90% uptime assuming no exchange outages/hacks


### Execution Lead Time:

If our proposal was to win, i2 Trading requires _up to_ 60 days to complete development and testing prior to going live.  If we are able to launch earlier, we will do so.


### Compensation:

- **Zero up-front set up costs**
-  Interest free loan of 5,000 DCR per cross. Willing to reduce the inventory request at a proportional rate to reducing the depth we offer.  i2 requests delivery of the loan one day prior to the start of the 6 month program.
    - I2 estimates BTC borrowing costs between 8%-12%/year.  Interest payable by the treasury.
- Payment of $40k/month for the above 6 crosses (Payable in DCR) for a minimum 6 month term, due within the first week of market making. We are willing to add more pairs at 5k per additional cross and can adjust which crosses are covered in the first 6 crosses.  We have chosen the crosses which we believe will be most beneficial to the marketplace.
- Exchange trading fees will be invoiced at month end with a maximum cap of $20k/month USD invoiced. We hope the actual charges are well below this cap, but the silver lining is that higher trading fees imply more trading and greater liquidity for DCR.
- Trading losses to be borne by i2 Trading.
- Exchange hacks/external operational losses borne by lender.
