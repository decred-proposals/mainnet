To help those of us who actively vote and do not have a background in MMs I wonder if you would be willing to help explain a couple of things:\n\n1. What would this mean precisely for those trying to enter and exit Decred positions of greater than $1M USD?  I sometimes hear from the community \"I can't even open or close a position of $_ million USD in Decred, so I've reduced my planned investment amount to $X.\" - would this proposal solve this?  If not, what would solve this?\n\n2. Last year this article was discussed a number of times by the community on Telegram when discussing the idea of reaching out to or proposing an MM: https://hackernoon.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-crypto-market-making-13a44bb2d207 - one of the things that often came up is transparency.  Can you comment on what kind of reporting of what you are doing for Decred Project would be available to the stakeholder community?\n\n3. Can you share anything about previous clients, current clients, and/or references to help confidence in the wider stakeholder community?","signature":"0a9ff7af333043112376dbfa04da05e5ceb9ad428d45fe97573b7e2c05ae15d5b25bff212fb63df8cff5126c4a0f662196742022c53f2ed10abe533ffb90400e","publickey":"c754b6f41f964520fc29b01d68852b251f7d761f8dd9ac44887caba039b7cfff","commentid":"3","receipt":"8f4348c89f03d8771763c5c45d7a04eef448bb50d520718b061fe2de076815f7d40b6377d90eed3b2551115215e1839c801de9f2e2365cc0cdd50e4bd5314b02","timestamp":1565211623,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If I pay you with DCR using the last print as the price and your immediately selling that DCR would result in you receiving $4.5k that would not be a great offer. Having a MM there to absorb your sell order very close to the last trade price significanly enhaces the user experience, and you get your $5k.\n\nLikewise, if you were a contractor and had some DCR you needed to sell every month to pay your rent and expenses it wouldn't be great if you put in a market order and the price dropped 5%+.\n\nWhat having greater depth on the oderbooks does is build market confidence as people can get in and out more easily. They are able to immediately mark their position to market and don't have to worry about \"nothing but air\" if they try and sell.\nIn essence the stakeholders are socializing the cost of a better market experience for all DCR users and traders.","signature":"e3e83db005d5d38029bcdd3b3ed808750f2f0f384e6063137606d3701063a72dcfd6ab63059f9cd2251a154976a8a387546844a09ae3700859e4c15bd4437c0a","publickey":"db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","commentid":"4","receipt":"35600a20ed4d1c6733c1c05476ba8596c4120255e965ee04103dd894ebd4349f422c69862eaa4d1b40571dda4fe1ec2b8a10426a64db84385be4278b40e81208","timestamp":1565212617,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Depending on how much more trading happens on exchange once the program begins, its possible that the trader would be able to comfortably execute this order entirely on exchange.

Our desk is willing to inventory risk of that size, and therefore the trader would end up with a very good price and less market risk.  We have routinely done trades of this size, and our clients were happy with the outcome.\n\n2) We will provide reports on the total Decred volume (not just our trading) in all the markets we are participating in. Over time, this should demonstrate the increase in DCR trading, which could be valuable to the community.\n\n3) To respect the privacy of our clients, we are not allowed to disclose who we have traded with.

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal are illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning.\n\nA) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250 FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process. Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and (3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4 FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:\n\n2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow. The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow. If I2 provides such amazing service. Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.\n\n3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.\nFirst, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service. Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation. Once again if I2 can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great. The community should know more about I2 and their service. We look forward to seeing a list. Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free put / call to trade around? That is what that $40,000 a month is - it is a option for I2 to trade around their own book. If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.\n\n4) A Potential Project Killer-\nAs someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say. The regulators know a few things really well. First, they know trading. Second, they understand markets and market mechanics. A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not. Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project. Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time. What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation. Say goodbye to the Treasury. Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left. The answer is no. Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.\n\nSecondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum\n\nI believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project. A killed project would not be a good SOV.","signature":"4bf98459777a5f166f8b78e55445a7d181e4d39bb1db3a8c5faaff0e83adedb135dbaea196bb5839a53d7a9ea624ea924b3d0c2a5f904d2914ec424a9bfa8e07","publickey":"528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","commentid":"25","receipt":"e17b5d490eeaf05e8e605c1ec9d8f43650fb6ddee01ffddec61964b0a6a0a615a48ff54fb6d752cb8e22860c95b53e8f7c3d3319c739e5b1fa9e065558e5b90b","timestamp":1565353872,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As a MSB and primary dealer we are able to make markets on all proof of work currencies as they have been deemed commodities not securities in the US.  The rules you refer to are for securities.  Moreover, there is no clear regulatory guidelines either way regarding market making cryptocurrencies.  I appreciate your concern and will voice your thoughts to our counsel to see if we are missing anything.\n\n2) Order flow and market making are two separate things, so I don't fully understand the point you are trying to make here.  The only point I can address is that market making is not the same as market manipulation.\n\n3) There are many prominent DCR stakeholders who have traded with us and continue to do so.  I would suggest you onboard with us and trade with us if you'd like to experience our OTC offering.  We cannot provide information to you about who we have traded with as that would be a breach of our MPA contract with our counterparties.\n\n4) I don't have a response to this as it's a hypothetical situation.\n\nThanks again for your comments!","signature":"107e0130cf6f2a5cbeb4d0c0a45561129f98d28ad9588444964ffffbe0dc89666f508836b8629dc121b676590676d33a286bdfdbad65efe866045ea7dbf4ca0d","publickey":"9772402a280884cdfa9a6708ab4e2e09ddc06ae2ac2c1a920eb33398c0a8a456","commentid":"29","receipt":"341c4d969acd8797a70479bb00a95724cc435abf121946469d21e0c6594a1afd6f2694d24321882eef949a9234407f1a9a482271f3f775bd09e4c301d032bb03","timestamp":1565367985,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

However, What you have written about all POW currencies is NOT TRUE. The SEC has written that two cryptocurrencies are not securities.  Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The SEC  has ruled that several crypto currencies are in fact securities. Being a POW or POS coin has not been been determined yet.   \n\n2) The fact that you want to provide bids and offers where the are not legitimate is the definition of market manipulation.  \n\nMarket manipulation is a type of market abuse where there is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the FREE AND FAIR operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency.\n\n3) You are asking for compensation of want $30,000 - $40,000 a month. \n Since you can't answer I guess that the answer is no one.  I have no problem with you being a market maker in Decred.  My issue is that you should not be compensated by Decred.  Citadel and Virtu make markets in thousands or stock, options and futures and they don't get paid by the company or the exchange.  Citadel and Vitru pay rebates for order flow.\n\n4) \nPart A.  Overstock spend $107 million to defend itself from the SEC due to their T-Zero project.  Kin actually spend $5 million defending itself from the SEC.  There is a real chance that there will be an investigation on Decred if they pay for Market Makers as a Service.  \n\nPart B is not hypothetical. The SEC firmly stated that they are watching the markets and watching exchanges and the participants. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum\n\nI can not stress enough how much danger the Decred project will put itself in if they pay for market making as a service.","signature":"5e5dca1d3496146bf082dd3214ddccb75e679e024a3df2a8a793a1f2f264ba48cf28b7f84570a0283042afd804b72540d0cd3ad40240f42220531bfb8940290b","publickey":"528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","commentid":"34","receipt":"d481cd8836708babb32502c319e2c2c57ffd981eb7eeefb60b28224133c7c7747b5e044a8d1c9344301dddb255a465fdb976677f2a50b1401cf24646d252c50c","timestamp":1565387364,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.\n\nAs such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.\n\n**As an alternative idea** It may be desirable for Decred introduce a layer of separation from the direct hiring of MMs. Decred may be better placed employing a project manager team (on which we do due diligence) who are tasked with enhancing market infrastructure. The treasury funds this PM team who shall then exercise their expertise in regulation compliance, legal matters and market infrastructure. Perhaps something for further discussion and evaluation by the community.","signature":"7be9378ff168da4c161c8bdb5d71a373bb7590c020e6ab020310aa4ddd225fc46f3918a71bb2a98ad946cf47413a9fc19694d7219fe4989670d3589458273b06","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"39","receipt":"003400a767dfc53024a6b7ea0cc9cd52d3d5f77d079a1c075eb50e2aece90bc78d080672214368e1994b7558ede9c934bbd5f4eb6d8bd0f17df981e3e2f70003","timestamp":1565440530,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
