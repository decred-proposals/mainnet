Supplemental Proposal For Decred Tutorials By Denni Lovejoy

Proposal Update: 
To everyone: Thank you for the clear feedback! 
Moving forward, I’ll be abandoning this proposal and deliver the 3 tutorials at the agreed upon price of $750 and will do the next proposal much cleaner. 
Yes, I’m fine with absorbing the costs. I’m chalking it up as a loss and learning experience & really shouldn't have made the mistake of overrunning. That’s my fault and I apologize to all the stakeholders for the mistakes and confusion from my end.
My intent has always been to give value. When pushback occurred regarding the overruns, it became clear to me that I was extracting value and in no way will I allow the first deal to get in the way of building goodwill with the community. 
I hope the 3 videos are satisfactory for the stakeholders! Let me know if you’d like me to make any minor changes regarding jy-p’s summary of feedback. 
Regarding the 3 verify binaries tutorials - those were delivered privately to the DCR member who requested them and was paid for. 
Again, thank you Decred community for this wonderful proposal platform. I learned so much about the Politeia process and Decred topics I covered. Everyone who engaged with me throughout the process deserves much credit! You know who you are and I’m looking forward to the next one!

## **I.  Summary**

In March 2019, [my Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f) was approved to do a set of 3 tutorials for Decred. 

The 3 tutorials were delivered and you can watch and/ or read them here to review the quality of my work:

[Decred Tutorial #1 - How To Setup The Decrediton Wallet :](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-RW2GuxTDk) (29:41 minutes) & Article Transcription: [Link](https://gist.github.com/Denni-Lovejoy/f2e5f838f2168b20f5ecaea6ab6fb94c)

[Decred Tutorial #2 - How to Setup a VSP, Stake & Vote:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9t73E1eTss) (19:13 minutes) & Article Transcription: [Link](https://gist.github.com/Denni-Lovejoy/7e491dd3bedfba5da006bcf73730ef7f)

## **II.  What**

In this proposal, I’m seeking a supplementary vote from the stakeholders to a) approve the overrun costs from my first proposal and b) to buy the rights to the 3 verifying binaries tutorials. 

## **III.  Why**

I underestimated how many hours were needed to complete my original proposal. Instead of the 25 hours scheduled, it took a total of 120 hours total to complete the first 3 tutorials. 

Additionally, I made 3 advanced tutorials covering how to verify binaries on Mac, Windows, and Linux. These 3 tutorials took 130 hours to complete. 

Stakeholders will have to ask themselves, “Would I still have voted for this if I knew the original proposal was going to cost an extra $2,850?” & “Do I approve the purchase to buy the copyrights for the 3 verifying binaries tutorials at $3,900?”

## **IV.  How**

Here’s how I dedicated 250 hours within 4 months on this proposal (includes the 25 hours from original proposal):

* Writing (6) Tutorial Scripts: 60 hours
* Recording (6) Tutorial Videos: 51 hours
* Editing (6) Videos: 77 hours
* Consulting & Communicating: 16 hours
* Making Updates: 15 hours
* Uploading & Publishing: 14 hours
* Researching (How To Verify Binaries): 10 hours 
* Writing (6) Gist Articles: 6 hours 
* Adding Timestamps: 1 hour

1.  I respectfully request  $2,850 USD (95 hours X $30 rate) for the overrun costs from my original proposal. 

2.  I respectfully request $3,900 USD (130 hours X $30 rate) for completing Section VI.  “Blockchain Tutorial” Deliverables. 

3. The grand total is $6,750 USD. 

4. Decred will own the copyrights to the content created in this proposal.

## **Authors Notes**

Thank you Decred community! Working on these tutorials has been a great joy of mine. For being a first time author on Politeia, I was able to create a meaningful body of work which I’m proud to present. I hope you appreciate the end result of my work just as much as I did in making them.
