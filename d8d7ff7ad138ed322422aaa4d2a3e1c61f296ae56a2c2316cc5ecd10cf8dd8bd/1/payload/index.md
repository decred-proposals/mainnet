## **I.  Summary**

In March 2019, [my Politeia proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f) was approved to do a set of 3 tutorials for Decred. 

The 3 tutorials were delivered and you can watch and/ or read them here to review the quality of my work:

## **II.  What**

In this proposal, I’m seeking a supplementary vote from the stakeholders to a) approve the overrun costs from my first proposal and b) to buy the rights to the 3 verifying binaries tutorials. 

## **III.  Why**

I underestimated how many hours were needed to complete my original proposal. Instead of the 25 hours scheduled, it took a total of 120 hours total to complete the first 3 tutorials. 

Additionally, I made 3 advanced tutorials covering how to verify binaries on Mac, Windows, and Linux. These 3 tutorials took 130 hours to complete. 

Stakeholders will have to ask themselves, “Would I still have voted for this if I knew the original proposal was going to cost an extra $2,850?” & “Do I approve the purchase to buy the copyrights for the 3 verifying binaries tutorials at $3,900?”

## **IV.  How**

Here’s how I dedicated 250 hours within 4 months on this proposal (includes the 25 hours from original proposal):

* Writing (6) Tutorial Scripts: 60 hours
* Recording (6) Tutorial Videos: 51 hours
* Editing (6) Videos: 77 hours
* Consulting & Communicating: 16 hours
* Making Updates: 15 hours
* Uploading & Publishing: 14 hours
* Researching (How To Verify Binaries): 10 hours 
* Writing (6) Gist Articles: 6 hours 
* Adding Timestamps: 1 hour

## **VII.  Pricing & Terms**

To show my good faith and reliability to the community, I delivered the 3 tutorials from my original proposal at the agreed upon price of $750.

1.  I respectfully request  $2,850 USD (95 hours X $30 rate) for the overrun costs from my original proposal. 

2.  I respectfully request $3,900 USD (130 hours X $30 rate) for completing Section VI.  “Blockchain Tutorial” Deliverables. 

3. The grand total is $6,750 USD. 

4. Decred will own the copyrights to the content created in this proposal.

5. Payment will be made in DCR if this Politeia proposal is approved.

## **Authors Notes**

Thank you Decred community! Working on these tutorials has been a great joy of mine. For being a first time author on Politeia, I was able to create a meaningful body of work which I’m proud to present. I hope you appreciate the end result of my work just as much as I did in making them.
