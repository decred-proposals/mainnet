While Dennis has indeed generated the videos, as agreed upon, he is asking for 10 times the original amount quoted for the videos  USD 7,500 instead of USD 750.  This was such a massive departure from what I have seen in the past, with respect to contractor billing, that I felt it needed to go up as its own proposal, which was communicated to Dennis.\n\nFirst, let’s have a quick look at [Dennis’ previous cryptocurrency videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dennislovejoy).  From what I see here, I would expect a video tutorial to be 5-10 minutes in length.  These videos have runtimes of roughly 30, 19, 28, 17, 17 and 14 minutes, for a total of 125 minutes of video.  The runtime is much longer than I or any stakeholder would have expected from looking at Dennis’ existing videos.\n\nSpeaking generally, I would only consider it acceptable for a proposal to go a few 10s of percent over budget, but to go 900% over budget is just absurd.  If the quality of the videos was truly exceptional, it might be a justifiable cost, however, it is not reasonable for a contractor to go ahead and complete all this work without prior stakeholder approval and expect for it to be paid for after-the-fact.  Dennis did in fact attempt to invoice for the entire USD 7,500 after completing the work, and, after consulting with some of the other contractors, I came to the conclusion that Dennis, and any other contractor who invoices beyond their budgets outlined in their proposal, should submit an additional proposal for the billing beyond the original proposal.\n\nAfter having watched several of the videos, here is a summary of my feedback:\n\n* The videos are easily twice as long as they should be.\n* Based on how long the videos are, I expect they will receive very few views.\n* The level of detail in the content of the videos is pretty good.\n* Lots of runtime is devoted to things that occur to me as out-of-scope, e.g. finding websites, checking websites are ‘secure’, creating logins, using email, using password managers, using exchanges, etc.\n* The editing of the video in the PIP video is very choppy.  There is an edit every several seconds.\n* The PIP provides limited utility in the video - I am left looking at video of Dennis looking at a screen.\n* There are effectively advertisements embedded in the videos for various service/software providers, e.g. keepass.info, DashLane, Tutanota.\n* A lot of focus is put on relatively intuitive processes, e.g. filling out forms, clicking on buttons, etc.\n* There is no use of testnet to demonstrate ticket purchases or similar, despite it being the best way to demonstrate various processes since it does not bleed information about mainnet coins.\n* There are factual errors in some important statements, e.g. that voting on proposals generates a reward.\n\nBased on my perception of the videos as low quality (for the reasons listed above), I think that it is totally unreasonable to pay the requested amount for the videos.  Even if Dennis accepts the originally proposed amount for the videos, USD 750, I expect they will not garner many views.  More importantly than Dennis’ requested payment of USD 7,500 for this work, we must consider the precedent set by paying for work that is performed in this fashion.  While I consider it likely that Dennis’ behavior here was not malicious, this cuts incredibly close to a standard bait-and-switch setup: someone gets a proposal approved for amount X, then intentionally expands the scope and bills for 10X.\n\nI will be voting against this proposal, and any other proposal that I feel requests an unacceptable increase in budget.  While I am not keen to deprive anyone of compensation for their time, allowing contractors to behave in this fashion would set an awful precedent for Decred.  It is expected that anyone creating proposals for the project has the self-management capability to avoid situations like this, so the responsibility for having gotten into this situation rests squarely with the proposer, not the stakeholders.","signature":"dcfbc89614777aa61f66b586c8e85e00456cb3547b808ea5831a06116cbadfc2b6bdc995b81afb00fc9db4e0aa2fbd59dd5bf66b68f18b7e0213beae5819780c","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"2","receipt":"9241448341ed57cd0677654604648d6f7fa3d785886887378f6c624babfbdc00288d296ee86bba3857cbce1ea3b81795ee360c0265484d9cbc6001ff6b5f1e08","timestamp":1561493203,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It may still be palatable if it's only a 20-30% increase (but even that is a bad idea). To put things in perspective, let's say if the original approved budget was $10,000, the overrun will be now be a whopping $100k instead!  How about that?\n\nWhile i empathized your situation, i think that agreeing to this proposal will set a very bad precedent for future proposals (which has been highlighted numerous times by others).  You should have kept to your original deliverable (3 videos) before making another proposal with a completely new budget if you feel the need to extend further. By doing that, you will limit your overrun and also the the damage caused to yourself in case thing doesn't go your way. \"Going the extra miles\" is definitely not the way to go here, unless the deliverable are of exceptional qualities and way above expectations, but let's not go into that now. \n\nAt the moment, you are only risking yourself of not being compensated fairly which i think is a real possibility here.  I'm sorry for being blunt, but i think you may have to learn this the hard way and to absorb the losses this time round and come out smarter next time. \n\nEither way, i truly appreciate your deliverable so far, and while i don't have any real complaint regarding the videos, i also think that there are still room for improvement in term of video length and making the deliveries more concise.\n\nNo matter what the outcome is, i certainly hope that you will not harbor any grudge or ill intention towards this project should this proposal fails. In a way, the proposal system is working exactly as it's designed for, and it is our responsibility to learn and completely understand it before submitting any proposal.
