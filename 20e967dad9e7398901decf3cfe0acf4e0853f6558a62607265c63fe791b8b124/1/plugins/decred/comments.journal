I am not a coder so can only speak to the Python access to dcrdata module. This tool alone will be extremely valuable for researchers to assess the performance of the Decred blockchain on-chain. I expect this will become an important data feed for large investors and strongly support it getting more support from the Decred community.\n\nOne only needs to look at the excellent work coming out of Coinmetrics, Adaptive Capital and Woobull.com for Bitcoin to see the value of a solid set on on-chain analysis tools. In particular, live analysis of Tickets will be a big focus of mine and I will be seeking to utilise this tool.\n\nThe value of $8k seems very reasonable to me for the work done (although I can't speak to the value from a developer standpoint). I also appreciate the proven work delivery and history as contributor. A yes from my end.","signature":"8b9f45e213f48371a0c71a2d2249eef0c7a17b8b84b28c3d8dcebba0f30809b61b8f15a1551bacaaaf89dfdd692da555714753cd9d6ef0e9f9fc7d3e49ec970d","publickey":"ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","commentid":"3","receipt":"7d5046ee3da19a824dcba14259f747e38d4c2b0caab0fe1f6e68bad794d6745b186631654bef299a366ccb5fe2fa91aa53be13eeb7ad2de824bf68893f001f08","timestamp":1564517282,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
