DECRED OFFLINE ECOSYSTEM BUILDING AND FIAT BACKING





# Abstract

Offer contains a proposal to build a food-points bonus and payment system in Europe countries. Presented by application and based on Decred coins obtaining and holding bonus systems will motivate millions of customers to purchase via automated high-price algorithm Decred coins and hold them to receive gifts and discounts in popular food networks and coffee points, making Decred coin volume and price become backed by food industry customers. 

Secondary, by delegating Decred coins to be used to build exclusive Decred branded franchise food points allows Decred to open a way in increasing its market and customer amount, while net profit of opened points would be delegated to Decred network and used according to stakeholders votings further. 

# Goal

By backing up the Decred ecosystem with fiat calculated value the network receives guaranteed delegation pool increasing for a long-term period by distributing net profit to the network or stakeholders up to the voting pool decision. Therefore, opened food points allows Decred brand to be presented on all coffee cups, bar tends and exterior banners across own placements. 

Building a stand-alone application product with user motivation system will convert already loyal customers of chosen franchise networks into Decred coin holders and buyers, increasing the price in organic way, making the DCR expansion on the open markets extremely faster.

# Why Decred

Continuous market researches show that building a coin-based infrastructure backed with fiat-based business model with management-regulated projects and currencies are leading to a common business relations instead of bringing the “blockchain dream” to life. Decred is one of few trusted and indeed decentralized projects and moreover - building the below described ecosystem using Decred will showcase a true usecase of cryptocurrency in a “fiated” world, showing that the industry could organically expand in the fiat-economy sector natively by the decision of decentralised community. 

We aim to showcase an opportunity of crowd-deciding model instead of management boards and chairmans monopoly, that we commonly see in all world economy segments.  

Moreover, Decred Wallet should be in use for the further evolution of below described model.

# How should this work?

## Coin backed bonus system application

A mobile application will feature a possibility to list offerings from food brands. Customers are purchasing Decred Bonus Points (Bonus Points are DCR exactly, we will name that as Decred Bonus Points to be more understandable to community and customers) using open exchanges API. Bonus Points could be used for generating a payment QR that will discount the purchase of a cup of coffee (for ex.). Each time customer spends DCR instead of fiat payment application will slightly increase his discount rate for further purchases (limited to 10% totally). In this way we approach an interest from food brands and points as we are leading customers to visit them multiple times, meanwhile, customers are motivated to purchase DCR and receive discounts and further increasing of their bonuses.

_Notice: Decred Bonus Points = DCR (it is the same unit)_

Cost of development and release (including legal, white label obtaining and soft launch promotion): $35,000

Timeline: 12 weeks

## Fiat - coin movements

* Customer purchases Decred Bonus Points (DCR) from their application using Visa/MasterCard payment
* OOM.AG company’s white label solution https://cryptoprocessing.io instantly send fiat to an exchange and converts in DCR by a highest possible rate. In case of using exchange without an ability to pay with fiat the system sends the payment to a liquidity pool, converting it to ETH/BTC up to the decision of an arbitrage bot and therefore converts ETH/BTC to DCR.
* Customer receives DCR
* Customer spends DCR for a payment
* DCR are being sent to a food point account. Food point receives funds from initial fiat liquidity pool, which will be maintained by an arbitrage bot.
* Development company receives 1% of each transaction in DCR

## Backing Decred with a fiat value: Abstract

Being interested in two major goals - to back up and grow Decred fund pool and increase Decred adoption on a wide market and increase Decred brand awareness, the choice of a food points franchise to delegate funds to forces to choose already mass adopted network with a low opening cost, highly automated processes and low royalties, as well as speed of opening and possibility to choose a right place (near business centres, universities, etc).

## Which network, where and why?

Our choice comes to Ukraine for next reasons: 

* Settled B2G connections that allow us to launch the process without any delays and problems
* Wide networking of our business developers in restaurant and coffee points industry 
* Ambitious improvements in business climate in the country and government after last elections
* Low cost of development teams comparing to most of other countries
* High concentration of blockchain enthusiasts and entrepreneurs 
* Technological mind of young people and high interest to hi-tech segments
* Based on public information, Ukraine is among the top-10 countries in the world in the number of cryptocurrency users
* High popularity of discounting platforms

The network we suppose is [Aroma Kava brand](http://aromakava.ua/en/), successfully covering the whole country. Coffee points - it is the segment that guarantees the biggest percentage of impression and interactions through the day/month/year.

As the time of opening is fast and the price is quite low, flexibility of the network allows to choose the best place for Decred branded points and the best terms among over 150 already opened points. As well we are capable of agree on increased margin rate for these points.

As well, being presented in Ukraine allows us to operate through EXMO exchange (where DCR has fiat pair to a local currency - UAH)

# Who we are
CryptoAgents is a long-time runned agency operating in blockchain and cryptocurrency marketing and B2B areas.

Being presented at https://cryptoagents.pro we are a digital agency presented in crypto area for 4 years already. Totally we helped to bring more than $200M for different projects. We already have cooperated with such projects as Bankex, NAGA, TokenClub, Lympo, BLOCKv and many others. The team consists 11 independent specialists: marketing managers, sales managers and business developers. Nearly a year ago we have changed our strategy and started to offer our services to post-ICO projects and platforms that are already live. Currently our plan is to attract crypto projects and coins to launch offline backed business models in various ways, in this way, we would be able to state that all our work for lots of projects now makes even more sense as crypto community would be far more bigger than we could have achieved with any Forbes article or DBM advertising for eternity.

The team consists of specialists united by a passion to use skills and networking to evaluate and open new horizons of blockchain integration in offline and online fiat-based business models.

During the last 4 years of experience we have gathered at our side lots of B2B and B2G valuable connections in EU, Asia and CIS regions that allows us to bring even most hard achieved ideas to life.

The company already has cooperated with a huge number of сustomers in the form of crypto projects for providing marketing services, with which a large amount of money was collected for various ICO. Some time ago our focus has fallen on projects that are already listed on exchanges and have working MVP. But recently, we found out the interest in introducing cryptocurrencies from several businesses, since this topic is becoming more popular every year and it is simply impossible to ignore it, keeping pace with the times. 

# Conclusion

After analyzing a number of businesses, as well as the conditions that they provide, we believe that chosen franchise is the most optimal, since in this case Decred is considered not as an investor, but as a cryptocurrency project that can turn into an offline brand with a real practical application, since everywhere it will be possible to find Decred logos, as well as have an opportunity to pay with DCR for all available services. We are pretty sure that cooperation could make a local boom. We also want to remind that this cooperation will entail a huge influx of additional financing for Decred, the distribution options of which were described above.

The last, but not least. As already was described above, the managing executives of the process are interested in a case in priority, as the percentage of fee for the app is 1%, as well as only 1% is being taken from Aroma Kava points net profit, we highly insist on be considered as a non-profit organisation with an only aim to create a remarkable and loud use case.

If approved by the community, other countries and businesses will also be considered in the future. Thus, Decred could become a pioneer in the expansion of various offline markets.

We welcome all constructive commentaries and we will look forward to engaging with community on this. Thank you for attention!
