The mocked up images were the icing on the cake.\n\nInvesting in coffee points is not an appropriate activity for the Decred Treasury. Ongoing block reward funding means Decred doesn't need to seek revenue generating activities to keep the development lights on. Using the Treasury funds to engage in investment-like activity would be a mistake and is I think very unlikely to happen.","signature":"49a5a283d6702921ab1d9a4824a15008a3ac05323eb2dec3377e65ad82387d3fa82d47ebb1f24f08a4731c51ee06658cbc9b3c9629a11fb9d32633aaa588de0f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"c1e7922a856e946c14905f282e8b64a7ce54bc2f1a343d923299dd29813667d9a35960490e07d132b240bcc2ed911730af8ad788cda57b3dfbf83336f1c09203","timestamp":1570223990,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So we want to clarify that the main aim is the case itself and giving a birth to a new stage of blockchain and cryptocurrency expansion, and as we are proposing to do this **THROUGH** actual offline business models coverage - indeed we need to mention that there will be income and we need to distribute it.\n\nWhy do we need voting and decentralization if the main aim of this ecosystem is just to exist, without any infrastructure being built around it? We vote for improve a network that has no actual use cases that would be still live even if blockchain technology will no longer be interesting for anyone.\n\nBut yes, we mention the revenue and its distribution, as it will appear, and there is no sense to hold fiat money on any account, neither we want to be shareholders of all income gathered through the offer, that is why we propose to use small % to develop idea further, and major % to give to Decred for any use. Our idea is very simple.\n\nKind regards.","signature":"2a2c89db398b5f01f6684c05cecd95010bc0ce06cd7b8275067123c2d430ce0925dcde106c2f1009f3d6beaec6f65f01d5ece1eadefa4a7f170111482f672505","publickey":"b35c168ed828f32e730c95949d19b1d74ce52b5ea3870db2d7bae6dd8df169bf","commentid":"7","receipt":"d30cc58d8979f7965f56b4d502e5ac84a034c90c5f5e5d4aa23f243dfa55634ac17b57dc0eca7d95b628e46e8021ddf39ae2da386373b5840907fdc221707804","timestamp":1570279882,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don't think the payments narrative is the right way to go though. I see other coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Dash doing this, and not getting much return on investment or sustainable on-chain activity. It's just cycling treasury funds through businesses at considerable expense. While this may raise general awareness a bit, I think it's unlikely customers will start using DCR this way.

As well, we have an accurate understanding of discounting systems and platforms and how they works, especially in Ukraine and EEU/CIS countries. The key feature for user will be possibility to increase discount every time he use app, that is far better motivation of spending fiat that purchasing any kind of in-game item, for example.\n\nAlso, while we are thinking in this way, while we are afraid to introduce such futuristic ideas into real life, we remain a speculative community more than technology evangelists, voting further and further for another round of order-book refill, instead of evolving the technology and not bringing life in it, but bringing it to life. It goes without saying that market making and alternative things are important, but since everything is fine with it now, it is time to introduce something new. Because it is easy to discover by opening approved proposals that there are basically more abstract things, such as numerous researches that the average user is not able to feel. But to drink a cup of coffee branded with the logo of Decred is simple and effective. Already at the stage of discussion with the community, we see a certain resonance, which had already come from the Ukrainian business for some time. Isn't that good? We are convinced that the future should be created by people, not by the passage of time. Therefore, we are here.\n\nAs for Dash, they already are connected with products like Paytomat, and they actually also cover some CIS and EU restaurants, we did a thorough research and we exactly know volume of transactions in their system for some of restaurants, it is indeed not big (less than $5,000 monthly), but promising already. Anyway, if Dash fails to insert their business model and technology in one way or other, why does it mean that Decred will go through the same way? We would not like to breed a philosophy on this topic, but we think everyone understands that many projects tried to implement the same ideas, but only those who differed from the others really came to success. For example, such a parallel can be drawn in relation to the online-taxi and Uber - they were not the first to try to realize this idea, but we see the result ourselves.\nAs for coffee points, we will not try to insist anyone to buy crypto, but we will make customer buy it to cover his willings without any minute of delay - as fast as he usually pays with his Visa/MasterСard, as we already has a solution for it.\n\nThe difference is not to give an option to pay with crypto, but to give benefits to those who hold it/buy it/spend it. It was clearly described in our concept. The concept of cumulative bonuses is a tested time, so we have no doubt about the chosen model.\n\nBest regards.","signature":"cd4e6a64ab2315fb9a8b180b50dbd1aebcdd7975cad4c5ef9bed2ef05219142aa19e42c911def32f27974ed844f5b1797fe9e5c0ee937f40d83eb6bfcbfc5707","publickey":"b35c168ed828f32e730c95949d19b1d74ce52b5ea3870db2d7bae6dd8df169bf","commentid":"11","receipt":"704675494efda15d1ef5ac9916328c83e5c962f2c3d7552e8815b5c06c011cf0aa07b35356d8e4ecc762fa8cc44ad17854f32723a6d2f63bd6b6f7590ec0ca05","timestamp":1570554565,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Buy DCR with fiat only to then spend it in cafes with a discount? Why not just buy coffee with fiat? This hassle eats people's time, there must be a very good reason for them, like a huge discount.\n\nBasically it is inspired by effective products that are active in CIS area (ex. _Pokupon_ where people buy subscription to receive discounts and gifts). People will be motivated to make each payment as each 1/3/5 payments through app will _increase_ their discount as it should be in loyalty program.\n\n\u003e Consider a \"test run\" in a very small scale - this will have more chances to get approved. Why not test one cafe first? Besides, that will be a good way to find missing features or pain UX points in using DCR in point-of-sale scenarios.\n\nFirst of all, let's divide loyalty system app and handling own branded points. App will be working in all points and further not only in this brand. \nAlso, building points it is a default model of franchise, but branding it costs each month of them being branded, which is a big cost for a long run. By purchasing franchise points in the amount we mentioned (15 totally) we negotiated to make them branded for free without extra charge, so that is a minimum amount to make this work without a need to pay monthly for branding. In addition, from the calculations in description you can see that we initially agreed with the franchise on a discount that saves $32,000 for the fund. Thus, the amount saved covers application development as well as marketing activities.\n\n\u003e Talk with Aroma Kava and verify your assumptions. Are they interested?\n\nAs mentioned, we have a direct networking connections in this area and segment, this is settled. Thanks to this we agreed on exclusive franchise conditions.\n\n\u003e Why not just build a network of point-of-sale systems with \"DCR accepted here\" labels, without complex loyalty programs?\n\n\u003e This is not what I want people to buy DCR for. I want people to know exactly why DCR exists and what it is made to protect against. I'm concerned that if we \"hook up\" people to the wrong reasons, they will leave as quickly as they come in.\n\nThat will be hard to push live, as just a POS-instrument audience will not engage so much as stats of projects that tried shows. In this way, this product will not be interesting for restaurant brands. But making people be encouraged by loyalty program makes them already be in the system of DCR, and there is more chance to engage them into the project itself. Consider this as some kind of remarketing audience.\n\n\u003e Some parts of text are hard to read and understand. I recommend to improve the translation. It is not just the initial proposal you'll need to communicate. Imagine if it passes - you will need to talk with the community a lot, and clearly communicate your ideas.\n\nWe will work on this, thanks for mentioning. This is a valid point, because most of our team members are not native English speakers.\n\n\u003e How any profit is made if Decred is subsidizing discounts for the buyers?\n\nProfit is being made mainly by points sellings. As we are making discounts, we still will have lots % of margin left as a revenue. Common price markup in coffee area in Ukraine is 250-300%.\n\n\u003e Is \"Decred Bonus Points\" and \"DCR\" the same thing or two different units?\n\nSame thing. Just named a Bonus Point for user understanding, would be equivalent to DCR, basically it would be DCR, but app will show it as Decred Bonus Point.\n\n\u003e Why a coffee shop would bother with all the trouble and sell products cheaper than for fiat?\n\nAll operational issues will be handled by us. Also, as mentioned with Pokupon example, it is a common way in Ukrainian restaurant business to attract clients by discounting. For example, one of the biggest pizza groups in Ukraine (Mister Cat) makes 50% discounts on all pizzas to attract clients. In this connection, they actually have no competitors in their segment. By the way, we have direct contacts with them too, so in the future their network may be added to the application. We also looked at them to open a potential crypto restaurant, but Aroma Kava currently provides the best conditions for cooperation. \n\n\u003e How about you take all profits to yourself but reduce the cost for the Treasury? In theory this would get you a self-sustainable business that cooperates with Decred. I don't see why charge Decred for next month if you have profits from previous month.\n\nProbably we have indeed faced some miscommunication, **Decred Treasury will be charged only once**, after that all expenses will be held by Aroma Kava group itself and development team is also charging only once. So there will be no need to charge next months. The offer includes only costs of building coffee points and development, without a hidden margin, but with a discount.\n\nThat is a very important part, if we would reduce profits % for Treasury, it would be less attractive, and our goal is to create a case that will allow us to use this case as a proof of model and capabilities, so we will be able to create more cases like this with other brands and networks with more profitable model for us (Decred model will be exclusive), we have connections with more industries to go with such proposals. Therefore, if this proposal is approved, we will undoubtedly continue the expansion of Decred in various markets, which is quite easy to implement due to our experience and wide networking. One of the main stumbling blocks for us is the support of at least 60% of stakeholders. Already at the end of this week we plan to launch a vote, so we hope for the support of the community. And we also hope that by this time everyone will have a clear picture, since we are still faced with the fact that some aspects of this proposal are perceived in completely the opposite way than we laid it. Therefore, we will be happy to confirm or refute certain understandings of people, just want to make this offer clear.\n\n\u003e What is CryptoAgents? How can we check your background and ability to deliver, and make sure this is not a cash grab scam? Why did you not include any such information in the proposal requesting such a big sum?\n\nHighly valid point, we checked other proposals and there is not much info on teams, however, we would love to present CryptoAgents. Thanks for mentioning. Being presented at https://cryptoagents.pro we are a digital agency presented in crypto area for 3 years already. Totally we helped to bring more than $200M for different projects. We already have cooperated with such projects as Bankex, NAGA, TokenClub, Lympo, BLOCKv and many others.\nThe team consists 11 independent specialists: marketing managers, sales managers and business developers. Nearly a year ago we have changed our strategy and started to offer our services to post-ICO projects and platforms that are already live. Currently our plan is to attract crypto projects and coins to launch offline backed business models in various ways, in this way, we would be able to state that all our work for lots of projects now makes even more sense as crypto community would be far more bigger than we could have achieved with any Forbes article or DBM advertising for eternity. \n\n\u003e I see two issues with such approach. First is our community is small and each person has a limited attention span. Second is it is an untested assumption that \"crowd\" will engage in making decisions for this particular project. I recommend negotiating with people who will work on this and including their names in the proposal.\n\nAs have mentioned, we could create a voting portal. Probably we could also grant some community members special status so they will engage and monitor. Also could be discussed in further.","signature":"24d9c9a1ef7c05ebc7c55a2c9dcfbe7405a57a0987bfc2374f42157b788eabba8695fe46df893eba921233560b9214648ec8998d4c57f4e0e0c33174e2fe1007","publickey":"b35c168ed828f32e730c95949d19b1d74ce52b5ea3870db2d7bae6dd8df169bf","commentid":"19","receipt":"c43d7f041cf6b9db0c93e6bf0f4ed0a3f88f920a615fcaff58fa8a6d1dd65865eafafebf78fd1685584d71d07afa29532f8af19ae6c7efc050f3a478ad467c06","timestamp":1571142334,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

People spend nights under the store waiting for the purchase of new iPhones, so there is no doubt about their purchasing power. Moreover, coffee drinks and cheesecakes are inexpensive.\n- As have mentioned, Ukraine is in top-10 list by popularity of crypto interest across the global audience.

I was asking to understand how it works and what motivates people.\n\n\u003e App will be working in all points and further not only in this brand.\n\nIs there some standard app that provides loyalty program features for multiple companies/brands? e.g. the user has one app and one account but can get discounts in multiple places.\n\nIs this app already live?\n\nBy \"points\" do you mean \"cafes\"/\"places\" or the \"bonus points\" (digital units)? It is one of the confusing terms used in the proposals.\n\n\u003e This is a valid point, because most of our team members are not native English speakers.\n\nThat was my guess. No problem for me, I just think many people got confused by some terms and complex sentences used in the proposal.\n\n\u003e Profit is being made mainly by points sellings. As we are making discounts, we still will have lots % of margin left as a revenue. Common price markup in coffee area in Ukraine is 250-300%.\n\nSo discounts and loyalty programs like this increase the sales of those cafes, they get more profit and share some of that extra with you, and you offer 90% of that back to Decred. Did I get it right?\n\n\u003e basically it would be DCR, but app will show it as Decred Bonus Point\n\nThanks for clarifying, it [was not clear](https://blockcommons.red/politeia-digest/issue023/) at all and some people thought they are two different units!\n\nIf that is really DCR displayed as \"Decred Bonus Points\", does it mean the app stores DCR for the user? Does it function like a wallet? Is there an associated DCR address somewhere behind the scenes? Does the app control that DCR (by controlling the keys), or are the Bonus Points stored in your database from which you send real DCR upon request? How to \"withdraw\" and transfer DCR from the app?\n\n\u003e As mentioned, we have a direct networking connections in this area and segment, this is settled.\n\n\u003e we have direct contacts with \\[Mister Cat\\] too\n\nOh I guess this is what you mean by \"Settled B2G connections\" in the proposal. All good then. I just think stating it explicitly will be more clear for the readers, e.g. \"We have established connections with X, Y and Z\".\n\nBy the way what is B2G? Isn't it B2B?\n\n\u003e Decred Treasury will be charged only once\n\nOk this is important and we need to clarify this before the vote. Do you mean once every month, or do you mean the Treasury should send the whole $283K to you in a single big upfront payment? If you mean the latter, for your information it is not how the Treasury works for all other proposals. Payments are send monthly for the work performed in previous months, and no large upfront payments were ever made that I'm aware of. Disclaimer: I don't manage the Treasury and it would be nice if the actual managers clarified this.\n\nIn any case, this is an important part of the deal. Please update the proposal and state explicitly what schedule of payments you expect.\n\n\u003e if we would reduce profits % for Treasury, it would be less attractive\n\nI can only speak for myself, but for me it would be more attractive for several reasons:\n\n1. If you can take the estimated $38K monthly profits for yourself, you will quickly become self-funding (like in 6-12 months?). This means you can reduce the cost of the proposal.\n1. Lower cost reduces the load on the Treasury. This is important in the context of recently lowered exchange rates.\n1. _You_ will be the entity exposed to the risk of not having these profits, which will show that your intent and estimation is serious.\n1. This eliminates any discussion about \"revenue generating activity\". I know the intent of your proposal is awareness and not revenue, but some people are confused.\n\nPlease correct if my math is wrong.\n\n\u003e Already at the end of this week we plan to launch a vote, so we hope for the support of the community. And we also hope that by this time everyone will have a clear picture, since we are still faced with the fact that some aspects of this proposal are perceived in completely the opposite way than we laid it.\n\nTo be honest I think this proposal is seriously misunderstood by many people as it stands today. Using me as an example, I don't entirely dismiss the entire idea but I'm very skeptical of this proposal in its current version.\n\nIf clarity is your goal I recommend editing the proposal text and clarifying all details that people asked about or got confused about _before_ you put it to a vote. Once the vote starts you cannot edit the proposal. As an option, you can talk to people in #proposals channel via [Matrix, Discord or Slack](https://decred.org/community/). Ideally, you would win someone from the community to go through your proposal and use their eyes to find and fix everything that is confusing or not clear. If your proposal receives significant changes, I would also signal it through our [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/decred) or Twitter to tell all people who dismissed this proposal initially to take a second look.\n\n\u003e we checked other proposals and there is not much info on teams\n\nMany passed proposals came from people who are very well known in the community and have a good track of contributions. Although I see how this is not obvious at all, perhaps because most of our communications happen in chats (Matrix is the primary platform).\n\n\u003e Being presented at https://cryptoagents.pro we are a \n\nImportant information, please include it in the proposal.","signature":"c52fd5f8527499deb0bf245acf28312a73baaa00ee5e87037b4069b34138588e1f4c5a31ae60f3e09ffbf3b445af14e82ea47c404071577c1dbbf9c364a93d01","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"22","receipt":"e438278cee4410595c9f117da77d034e98a4626bf1903cc8d1a7393fc4a2a69ea77f20757e3c52dad3843c4dce604cb63a5b431893f08207d57215520f783507","timestamp":1571386794,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
