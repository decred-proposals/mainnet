The mocked up images were the icing on the cake.\n\nInvesting in coffee points is not an appropriate activity for the Decred Treasury. Ongoing block reward funding means Decred doesn't need to seek revenue generating activities to keep the development lights on. Using the Treasury funds to engage in investment-like activity would be a mistake and is I think very unlikely to happen.","signature":"49a5a283d6702921ab1d9a4824a15008a3ac05323eb2dec3377e65ad82387d3fa82d47ebb1f24f08a4731c51ee06658cbc9b3c9629a11fb9d32633aaa588de0f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"c1e7922a856e946c14905f282e8b64a7ce54bc2f1a343d923299dd29813667d9a35960490e07d132b240bcc2ed911730af8ad788cda57b3dfbf83336f1c09203","timestamp":1570223990,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So we want to clarify that the main aim is the case itself and giving a birth to a new stage of blockchain and cryptocurrency expansion, and as we are proposing to do this **THROUGH** actual offline business models coverage - indeed we need to mention that there will be income and we need to distribute it.\n\nWhy do we need voting and decentralization if the main aim of this ecosystem is just to exist, without any infrastructure being built around it? We vote for improve a network that has no actual use cases that would be still live even if blockchain technology will no longer be interesting for anyone.\n\nBut yes, we mention the revenue and its distribution, as it will appear, and there is no sense to hold fiat money on any account, neither we want to be shareholders of all income gathered through the offer, that is why we propose to use small % to develop idea further, and major % to give to Decred for any use. Our idea is very simple.\n\nKind regards.","signature":"2a2c89db398b5f01f6684c05cecd95010bc0ce06cd7b8275067123c2d430ce0925dcde106c2f1009f3d6beaec6f65f01d5ece1eadefa4a7f170111482f672505","publickey":"b35c168ed828f32e730c95949d19b1d74ce52b5ea3870db2d7bae6dd8df169bf","commentid":"7","receipt":"d30cc58d8979f7965f56b4d502e5ac84a034c90c5f5e5d4aa23f243dfa55634ac17b57dc0eca7d95b628e46e8021ddf39ae2da386373b5840907fdc221707804","timestamp":1570279882,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I don't think the payments narrative is the right way to go though. I see other coins such as Bitcoin Cash and Dash doing this, and not getting much return on investment or sustainable on-chain activity. It's just cycling treasury funds through businesses at considerable expense. While this may raise general awareness a bit, I think it's unlikely customers will start using DCR this way. Dash DAO might be interested?","signature":"7e64c718f4300b5cf2cf5829dc3f13dd92f1cb46f5280bea4c89386e1c9d01a83123137bc8742ae0bbfcb4863bae1445d197f36138bf0f9062ddfd4eb69b4d03","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"10","receipt":"de29d5008f03a49048075249968f203a90b86f863c2d8e121e6fa0e7adcf8853f457733ceea51535d29a24445f2a9279e52af99b977df9c837f7441d018eba08","timestamp":1570512480,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As well, we have an accurate understanding of discounting systems and platforms and how they works, especially in Ukraine and EEU/CIS countries. The key feature for user will be possibility to increase discount every time he use app, that is far better motivation of spending fiat that purchasing any kind of in-game item, for example.\n\nAlso, while we are thinking in this way, while we are afraid to introduce such futuristic ideas into real life, we remain a speculative community more than technology evangelists, voting further and further for another round of order-book refill, instead of evolving the technology and not bringing life in it, but bringing it to life. It goes without saying that market making and alternative things are important, but since everything is fine with it now, it is time to introduce something new. Because it is easy to discover by opening approved proposals that there are basically more abstract things, such as numerous researches that the average user is not able to feel. But to drink a cup of coffee branded with the logo of Decred is simple and effective. Already at the stage of discussion with the community, we see a certain resonance, which had already come from the Ukrainian business for some time. Isn't that good? We are convinced that the future should be created by people, not by the passage of time. Therefore, we are here.\n\nAs for Dash, they already are connected with products like Paytomat, and they actually also cover some CIS and EU restaurants, we did a thorough research and we exactly know volume of transactions in their system for some of restaurants, it is indeed not big (less than $5,000 monthly), but promising already. Anyway, if Dash fails to insert their business model and technology in one way or other, why does it mean that Decred will go through the same way? We would not like to breed a philosophy on this topic, but we think everyone understands that many projects tried to implement the same ideas, but only those who differed from the others really came to success. For example, such a parallel can be drawn in relation to the online-taxi and Uber - they were not the first to try to realize this idea, but we see the result ourselves.\nAs for coffee points, we will not try to insist anyone to buy crypto, but we will make customer buy it to cover his willings without any minute of delay - as fast as he usually pays with his Visa/MasterСard, as we already has a solution for it.\n\nThe difference is not to give an option to pay with crypto, but to give benefits to those who hold it/buy it/spend it. It was clearly described in our concept. The concept of cumulative bonuses is a tested time, so we have no doubt about the chosen model.\n\nBest regards.","signature":"cd4e6a64ab2315fb9a8b180b50dbd1aebcdd7975cad4c5ef9bed2ef05219142aa19e42c911def32f27974ed844f5b1797fe9e5c0ee937f40d83eb6bfcbfc5707","publickey":"b35c168ed828f32e730c95949d19b1d74ce52b5ea3870db2d7bae6dd8df169bf","commentid":"11","receipt":"704675494efda15d1ef5ac9916328c83e5c962f2c3d7552e8815b5c06c011cf0aa07b35356d8e4ecc762fa8cc44ad17854f32723a6d2f63bd6b6f7590ec0ca05","timestamp":1570554565,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
