The mocked up images were the icing on the cake.\n\nInvesting in coffee points is not an appropriate activity for the Decred Treasury. Ongoing block reward funding means Decred doesn't need to seek revenue generating activities to keep the development lights on. Using the Treasury funds to engage in investment-like activity would be a mistake and is I think very unlikely to happen.","signature":"49a5a283d6702921ab1d9a4824a15008a3ac05323eb2dec3377e65ad82387d3fa82d47ebb1f24f08a4731c51ee06658cbc9b3c9629a11fb9d32633aaa588de0f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"c1e7922a856e946c14905f282e8b64a7ce54bc2f1a343d923299dd29813667d9a35960490e07d132b240bcc2ed911730af8ad788cda57b3dfbf83336f1c09203","timestamp":1570223990,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
