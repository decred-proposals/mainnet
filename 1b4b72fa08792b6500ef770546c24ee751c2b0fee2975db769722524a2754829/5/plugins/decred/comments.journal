The mocked up images were the icing on the cake.\n\nInvesting in coffee points is not an appropriate activity for the Decred Treasury. Ongoing block reward funding means Decred doesn't need to seek revenue generating activities to keep the development lights on. Using the Treasury funds to engage in investment-like activity would be a mistake and is I think very unlikely to happen.","signature":"49a5a283d6702921ab1d9a4824a15008a3ac05323eb2dec3377e65ad82387d3fa82d47ebb1f24f08a4731c51ee06658cbc9b3c9629a11fb9d32633aaa588de0f","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"c1e7922a856e946c14905f282e8b64a7ce54bc2f1a343d923299dd29813667d9a35960490e07d132b240bcc2ed911730af8ad788cda57b3dfbf83336f1c09203","timestamp":1570223990,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So we want to clarify that the main aim is the case itself and giving a birth to a new stage of blockchain and cryptocurrency expansion, and as we are proposing to do this **THROUGH** actual offline business models coverage - indeed we need to mention that there will be income and we need to distribute it.\n\nWhy do we need voting and decentralization if the main aim of this ecosystem is just to exist, without any infrastructure being built around it? We vote for improve a network that has no actual use cases that would be still live even if blockchain technology will no longer be interesting for anyone.\n\nBut yes, we mention the revenue and its distribution, as it will appear, and there is no sense to hold fiat money on any account, neither we want to be shareholders of all income gathered through the offer, that is why we propose to use small % to develop idea further, and major % to give to Decred for any use. Our idea is very simple.\n\nKind regards.","signature":"2a2c89db398b5f01f6684c05cecd95010bc0ce06cd7b8275067123c2d430ce0925dcde106c2f1009f3d6beaec6f65f01d5ece1eadefa4a7f170111482f672505","publickey":"b35c168ed828f32e730c95949d19b1d74ce52b5ea3870db2d7bae6dd8df169bf","commentid":"7","receipt":"d30cc58d8979f7965f56b4d502e5ac84a034c90c5f5e5d4aa23f243dfa55634ac17b57dc0eca7d95b628e46e8021ddf39ae2da386373b5840907fdc221707804","timestamp":1570279882,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
