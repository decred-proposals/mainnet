We are currently developing the comic's own social media accounts. While small, Twitter and Instagram accounts got awesome engagement from the community.\n\nDeveloping content is different from social media management. Our idea is to generate content that anyone in the community can use, reuse, adapt, transform or whatever they need to do.\n\nWhile we don't yet have a substantial follower base to measure it's impact, the plan is not to grow the DCR Comic account, but to develop content that others, like the @decredproject acocunt or the Digest, which do have more followers can use to boost up engagement with the project.\n\nIt may sound awkward but anyone can \"test\" the comic impact by sharing the pieces we are creating. If you feel it is a good explanation, share it. Compare its performance to you other posts and let us know! I would really like to have insights on its impact.\n\nWe have plans to keep up the work. We see the comic as the first step. We would love to expand it into animated videos and new comics. I think there is always something that needs a better explanation. We would like to develop a comic for each section of the official documentation, but there are also opportunities to talk about Politeia proposals, events, new developments and broader/unsolved problems in the crypto space.\n\nAs long as the developers keep improving and expanding their code, we will have lots of topics to talk about.","signature":"20a2321f3c95edc93cafaa9faeefa80432cd7bcdc676c6264fcc7665485ddc6ed95bed0abe33acd412bcfbbcc7ba0d372911717b736eff3f2f4c7610f237180c","publickey":"61fd66ef5eeb39a53997662796b5c0e1e47d92c8fbd540ee826cf59d9c45f746","commentid":"4","receipt":"2151000a1b82551925db78057c0b1c2a85e89f2831d4b9cbef478eef11e0d76f19b8283618fbc2b95e2f9fbe7ca8db370960b593823a97d7fbcbf595be51d707","timestamp":1570484356,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

There's some talent here. Like others, I find it hard to place a DCR value on this though. While some may find visual information easier to digest, I don't think these are necessary to understand any of the planned topics. Indeed, anyone that really needs to understanding these (generally complex) topics will need to read the docs anyway. And it isn't clear educational materials on complicated topics are going to catch users' attention on social media--though I'm old and not on IG, so maybe I'm not a great source on that. This is complicated by the fact that the social channels you've set up don't yet have enough subscribers to have data on whether or not these are creating the desired response. Do you have anecdotal evidence to share around reactions to the comics you're produced so far?\n\nI do think that you've produced other good contributions for the project. Your guide on setting up a full node in your office is set to be included in a [page on dcrdocs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdocs/pull/989). The other graphics produced are high quality. And I think you are showing a good (and growing) understanding of the project. I'm wondering, are you already contractors? If not do you aim to become contractors and continue contributing to the project? If this proposal doesn't pass, do you think there are other areas your talents could be applied, such as general graphic design, animation, video editing, memes, other types of art (e.g. for medium pieces)?","signature":"7afdeb069cccaa4b5745b6734236873abe12cbab8c4c579e920a98ec1f1a341a7c1c7d1332b10178b83d5b1505ae4862d9f13d72b0c91b19181e66868db4bb03","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"5","receipt":"b4394b1814db70ad1aa6ce25fd3c37d16fa10df0a7800615f762d74e8bc0ede814af0be9c131af830ff01d2edbf80e1876c82407569aa342879520a14a4aaa0c","timestamp":1570518154,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

From our understanding, we had to introduce ourselves by generating value, and this comic proposal kinda summarizes our work. \n\nAnecdotal evidence: We've shown the comic to people who are not into crypto, but \"have heard about it\", and it got them reading it and asking questions like \"Is there already a digital state on the internet?\". Again, I encourage everyone to show the comic to people and help us understand if it works.\n\nRegarding the educational approach, we are also leaving behind a bunch of graphic assets that could be re-adapted to other needs like t-shirts, presentations, answering posts on social media. From day one we did our best to open up the development of the comic, and would love to collaborate on the strategy.\n\nThe comic serves two purposes. The first one is to develop content that the community could use in multiple ways, be it soundbites, explainers or cute_stakey.png. Reusable content is good content, like those memes that just don't die.\n\nThe second one is to show unique work. We teamed up with @nachito about a year ago, and we've been working as a creative duo mostly for projects related to the crypto space. The comic was something new and did present a challenge.  We could also do:\n\n- Motion graphics\n- UI Design\n- Written articles\n- Infographics\n- Social media posts\n- Presentations\n- Project documentation\n\nWe are learning to do:\n\n- UX Design\n- Python programming\n  - Algorithmic music\n  - Data scraping/analysis\n- 3D modeling\n  - Maya\n  - zBrush\n\nWe would like to keep contributing to the project. We are exploring as much as we can.\n\nIf this proposal doesn't pass, I guess we'll re evaluate the comic strategy and figure out other ways to contribute. We've been lucky to find the time to develop the comic. While we find other ways to collaborate we must keep up working with (less interesting) projects not related to Decred. Sadly, it may become difficult to keep up the pace.\n\nBeing from Argentina means we value what Decred is developing and at the same it makes us very cost-effective. If this proposal passes it enables us to work full time on Decred. We will not only develop the comic, but also dedicate more time to find those other areas where our skills are needed and contribute in every way possible. It will enable us to have (more) time to dive in and understand what the community is building and how we can collaborate.","signature":"a430eb1e86c23e21defd7188cc285e7e1883ad5a167fd9744901b5cdc43b308a2d1d020704c217bace24c89d7f643595b6e0fd9c67831dc2678d4bbe3c1cdd09","publickey":"61fd66ef5eeb39a53997662796b5c0e1e47d92c8fbd540ee826cf59d9c45f746","commentid":"7","receipt":"75d72d6fdafa2c0f99c8751b27a188f39547815c62a363c3fa14147db911dab9e2f8bcd20b268ac9d6ae06c25a56e6a10db2eaffa12dfd76f066d593c7b24e03","timestamp":1570554547,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
