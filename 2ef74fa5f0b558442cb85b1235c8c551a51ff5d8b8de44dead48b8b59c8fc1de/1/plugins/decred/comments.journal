We still don't have any solid analytics that allows us to tell it's reach. We are working with other community members to publish the comic in a wide range of channels, from Chinese platforms like Chain Node and WeChat to the Spanish speaking Instagram accounts.\n\nIt will take some time to grow each social media account and oil the relaying of the comic.\n\nRegarding comic production, while the Quora post focuses on inked comics,  the DCR Comic main targets are digital channels. Aside from the static scenes, we are adapting everything to the required formats for each social media platform. @nachito has also started animating some scenes in order to make use of video on these platforms and reach new ones in the future, like YouTube.","signature":"a268119bb5774ef59812f514f985f5ba20929f10b30a76ac2b750238ca6c091d8abfa8fa62b14cb64cdd63c851d14256c106bf9ac216978b0a75f00198c60d0a","publickey":"61fd66ef5eeb39a53997662796b5c0e1e47d92c8fbd540ee826cf59d9c45f746","commentid":"2","receipt":"8580ea258c5a7754ca58fe5b2c64baa341c30cca290657dc213b7d71329634a6947eabfd49dd8b985e7f112527d5033e5c78a7d56f1d6b71906fe6e4196dc705","timestamp":1570473562,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think this may be a good way to get the less-technical people to understand the important concepts of the network.\n\nThat said, I'm a bit reluctant to authorize a 3-month spending plan without any idea of how much impact we'll have from this.\n\nAlso, just curious, do you have plans to seek a renewal after these 3 months for future work, and if so, don't you think you'll run out of topics to develop?","signature":"c5edfb72974dd197487a6ace5fb8672fe77d74bf8787d7d64a095420ea3ffe7fc66d0e1c17360899eaf33e7c0d195bdd468a7e01b90ce37264d3f1c885f99d0f","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"3","receipt":"4224f524fe69bb56e065a7ee7c066df38e404dc6c33f10b6ebf163230cd21060d56353cfeeba3e24563517c8c862b0b73669fc65b93a63c31b7981eb586eaf00","timestamp":1570482672,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We are currently developing the comic's own social media accounts. While small, Twitter and Instagram accounts got awesome engagement from the community.\n\nDeveloping content is different from social media management. Our idea is to generate content that anyone in the community can use, reuse, adapt, transform or whatever they need to do.\n\nWhile we don't yet have a substantial follower base to measure it's impact, the plan is not to grow the DCR Comic account, but to develop content that others, like the @decredproject acocunt or the Digest, which do have more followers can use to boost up engagement with the project.\n\nIt may sound awkward but anyone can \"test\" the comic impact by sharing the pieces we are creating. If you feel it is a good explanation, share it. Compare its performance to you other posts and let us know! I would really like to have insights on its impact.\n\nWe have plans to keep up the work. We see the comic as the first step. We would love to expand it into animated videos and new comics. I think there is always something that needs a better explanation. We would like to develop a comic for each section of the official documentation, but there are also opportunities to talk about Politeia proposals, events, new developments and broader/unsolved problems in the crypto space.\n\nAs long as the developers keep improving and expanding their code, we will have lots of topics to talk about.","signature":"20a2321f3c95edc93cafaa9faeefa80432cd7bcdc676c6264fcc7665485ddc6ed95bed0abe33acd412bcfbbcc7ba0d372911717b736eff3f2f4c7610f237180c","publickey":"61fd66ef5eeb39a53997662796b5c0e1e47d92c8fbd540ee826cf59d9c45f746","commentid":"4","receipt":"2151000a1b82551925db78057c0b1c2a85e89f2831d4b9cbef478eef11e0d76f19b8283618fbc2b95e2f9fbe7ca8db370960b593823a97d7fbcbf595be51d707","timestamp":1570484356,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
