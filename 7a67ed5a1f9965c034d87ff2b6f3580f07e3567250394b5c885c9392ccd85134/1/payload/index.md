Decred Poker Series

**What**

A Poker series with free entry and price pools in Decred, funded by the treasury.




**Why**


Decred lacks the attention it deserves and people complain it has no utility apart from being a store of value.
So I thought why not give the people something they can have fun with and win Decred along the way and as a side effect increase the chatter and attention about DCR.

A weekly rythm of tournaments at the weekend should increase the overall attention towards Decred in my opinion. Due to most attention spans of people the best would be that they hear about the Poker Series all week and see the transactions to the winners on the weekend.

Also, if it's tweeted about with the right hashtags it's likely that poker players get attracted who had no contact with crypto before, but might find it interesting. So we might attract people to Decred that we would have never reached otherwise.
TL;DR "Decred has a Poker series" alone will increase the overall attention.

I don't think any other Project has done that before, but the treasury gives us the opportunity to get something like a Poker Series rolling.





**How**

On 888poker it's possible to host poker tournaments for friends. You can host them as free tournaments, so nobody has to pay Dollars or Decred to qualify/entry for a tournament with a price pool of Decred. I'll get to the qualification conditions later.

These free hosted tournaments are secured by a password, so I'm in in control that only those who qualified can participate in the tournament.
Although we do free entry tournaments without cash involved, but we'll send out Decred to the winners/paid places.

You can play 888poker tournaments by friends on mobile or Desktop.

What I plan is a weekly tournament on Saturday with 10 seats and a final tournament on the last sunday of the month with the 4 winners of the weekly tournamnent plus the two best second placed players, which would make a final table of 6 seats. To qualify for the final table you have to end the weekly tournament at least as second. We have then 8 participants and the nineth participant could be the best third place of the weekly tournaments, i.e. stack size before he was beaten.

An idea would be to livestream the final tournament on the Decred Youtube-Channel to even more raise the awareness.




In order to test if I can create a tournament without participating myself I have created one. It would be great if at least 2 people could just sign up for the tournament, just to see that it starts without me. 2 entrants is the minimum.
It would be unfair if I would have to participate in every tournament.

This is how in invitation email looks like, but it's enough to tell people the tournament name and password.

**Qualification**

My first idea is that people have to tweet about DCR under the hashtag #DecredPokerSeries hashtag if they want participate in a tournament.

We could now choose the most popular tweets, but I consider it unfair, as some people have more followers than others and can tweak the popularity of their tweet.

My favorite procedure would be a random picking of people who tweeted under the hashtag, just to keep it super fair and give a big pool of people a real chance to "qualify".
Tweets must contain $DCR and #Decred, #Poker and #DidYouKnowDecred.

Examlpe for a valid tweet:
"#DidYouKnowDecred has a Poker series that pays prices in #DCR and I want to participate. $DCR #Decred #DecredPokerSeries #Poker"





**Who**

As 888Poker-User I'll do the organization of the tournaments (hosting, randomly choosing and contacting the participants and winners). It really is such a small effort valued in time, that it's not worth it to ask for money to administrate the Poker Series.

If someone feels like compensating me a bit for that I'll provide a donation address, but I really can't charge money for something that isn't really work at all and is even fun.

The distribution of the prizes shouldn't be done by me, because there is a risk that is not 0% that I'll just run with the money. So an official team member should do the actual distribution and I only collect the addresses of the winners.





**When and how long**

I'd like to await feedback first before I think about for how long this proposal should be aiming.
But to keep the attention on Decred and the Poker series I would suggest a time period of 6 months.

After approval the campaign can start immediately, but I would suggest to announce it before a week of "Qualifier-Tweets" start.




**Budget**

The funding of this proposal goes to 100% to winners in the tournament. I'll have to make up my mind still to find the right balance of an attractive monthly amount of Decred that get's distributed to Poker players while the amount is not so large that it's not too expensive to achieve the desired outcome.

My initial feeling is 50 Decred price pool for the weekly tournaments, 25 for place 1, 15 for place 2 and 10 DCR for place 3 (who doesn't qualify for the monthly final tournament.
For the monthly final table I'd double the price pool with the same pricing structure for place 1 to 3. (50/30/20

So the budget would be (4 x 50 DCR) + (1 x 100 DCR) = 300 DCR per month
That's at current prices 4500$ per month. I find that's the right balance between incentivizing to want to participate -> more qualifier tweets and not spending too much money for the desired effect of the Poker Series.
The attention will even grow at higher prices.

But as I said, I wait on feedback on that. It's just to give a first idea.





**Risks**

You have to rely on me with organizing the tournaments.
Participation is for people 18+. We'll have to declare that but can't prevent minors trying to qualify for a tournament.
