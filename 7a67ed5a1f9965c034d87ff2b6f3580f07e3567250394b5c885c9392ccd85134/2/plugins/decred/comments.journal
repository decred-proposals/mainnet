I think it's a refreshing idea and although Poker is inherently  tied to \"gambling\", you smartly put it into a casual game that rewards the top player at the end. Therefore, there really isn't any gambling involved per se, but that's subjective. Now onto the game itself: \n\n1. I am not very sure if using a third party hosting is a good idea as i'm not sure how secure it would be. However, if there is no money involved during registration and the game is truly free, i guess this isn't much of a critical problem. Have you explored any self-hosting possibility using open source game? \n2. There are multiple variant of poker game if i'm not mistaken, although i'm not thoroughly familiar with all of them, what variant will this poker be?\n3. The prize pool definitely need some revision, i'm of the mind that weekly prize should be scaled down a little bit such that it is just enough to hook-in players but the grand finale of the month can remain roughly the same or even scaled up in order to encourage the weekly winners to follow through (aka show-up) until the very end. A high stake also increases anticipation and hype for not only the participants, but also spectators who are not in the game.\n4. Need to find out potential abuse that the players can come out with, namely:\n-How are you going to make sure the players selection are truly random? Will you drop their name thru some online random generator (and make it live)? What kind of participant is considered  qualified? (i.e: Social media account which is of at least 1 month old?)\n-After players are selected, how are you going to make sure that there is no possible *collaboration* among the selected players to rig the game so that everybody will mutually benefit from the outcome of the game?\n-How are you going to prevent the same players from participating multiple times under different account?\n-Etc, etc?\n5. You said the monthly  finale will consist of 4 top players + 2 second placers from weekly game. Am i right to say that there will be a total of 5 games in one month in this order Saturday 1, Saturday 2, Saturday 3, Saturday 4, Sunday 4 (Finale). If that's the case, how are you going to determine which second placers to move on to the finale as there are 8 of them?\n6. Should we maybe merge the final week to just one event such that it become Saturday 1, Saturday 2, Saturday 3, and Sunday 4(Finale). Meaning there is only 3 weekly game per month. That way, we can select all first and second placer winners to qualify for the finale for that month which is exactly 6 players. By doing this, we can also cut down one weekly event and thus reducing the prize pool and saving cost.\n \n\nThat's all i can think of for now, cheers! If the details and kinks can be worked out satisfactorily, i will definitely support this idea.","signature":"aabcfea690ebe8cac3e98c55e8830f31fc70bab77584ac3dffb81918344b2fd6629977ac8210e07192172c38708e1293f59df97b1ae6624cac7613557d72120d","publickey":"a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c","commentid":"4","receipt":"ebb4ee6177796a0e1fea24528b50e89c54e30e023b8db448e8ee4420cb15d954e226cffec242fab48deb1bd538afdbb993b713f0e2d9bae256520a177a9a5c09","timestamp":1596346987,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In addition, we can consider removing 2nd place and 3rd place prize in the monthly Finale and only have one single Grand Final winner who get all the all the prize of 100DCR. This will drive everyone to try their very best as they will appreciate that the stake is high, or they go home with nothing. In a way, the finale should feel a lot more intense than the qualifying weekly event. Afterall, they already won the weekly prize so the finale is actually kind of a bonus to double dip.","signature":"fd01142beb0e7f3178ebef57bda364e5d652e85ddf39ba1911e78e78697305dc310186e47ce462e9742f30d6ec228db1b0e3834439266f65313a052c01943b09","publickey":"a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c","commentid":"5","receipt":"b4dd6d9dca82aed4c20277445984482d013225e9c41bd9262c5dd258fc74d1c1f178f3f5f9740c6c28c362aa9524ef5074f692be0d5528a29851a9bb4d306a02","timestamp":1596347311,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
