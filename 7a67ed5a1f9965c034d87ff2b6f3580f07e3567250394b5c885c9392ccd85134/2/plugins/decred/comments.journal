You will certainly see me participating when possible - my preference would be poker stars but all for 888poker if you feel its the \"safest\" site for our brethren and brethrenitas to be playing on.  Safe = regulatory compliant with treasury funds/information around members isn't used without permission. How cool would a decred implementation of poker stars be where I can click on an app in my decrediton wallet safely and desktop play (you wouldn't want this to be your savings wallet). \n\nNice idea\n\nCap","signature":"05f50aed60d459a1a237f7175964227b22a12577d3623ce94e018a78797e4455efafe23cbd87bf62b73bbe45c9efe077214fcb30eb5704fd45b7682e4e9cc307","publickey":"5c369425a1201f971945e41467d3f8c26ca1b4e995436b7b8c4722ecfe98c1c2","commentid":"1","receipt":"c4bbcfd7ce60c433b30dc03a7266683df3cfb02e5db5b1a03af3e8b2bc538279189dcc6a265095351394f2978717dbc987e1c2ad94da832a11d7fbff9c3b8d09","timestamp":1596291430,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let me know if you know a better platform that let's you create your own tournaments.
