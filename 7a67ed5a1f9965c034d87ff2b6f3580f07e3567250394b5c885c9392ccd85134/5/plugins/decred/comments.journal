I think it's a refreshing idea and although Poker is inherently  tied to \"gambling\", you smartly put it into a casual game that rewards the top player at the end. Therefore, there really isn't any gambling involved per se, but that's subjective. Now onto the game itself: \n\n1. I am not very sure if using a third party hosting is a good idea as i'm not sure how secure it would be. However, if there is no money involved during registration and the game is truly free, i guess this isn't much of a critical problem. Have you explored any self-hosting possibility using open source game? \n2. There are multiple variant of poker game if i'm not mistaken, although i'm not thoroughly familiar with all of them, what variant will this poker be?\n3. The prize pool definitely need some revision, i'm of the mind that weekly prize should be scaled down a little bit such that it is just enough to hook-in players but the grand finale of the month can remain roughly the same or even scaled up in order to encourage the weekly winners to follow through (aka show-up) until the very end. A high stake also increases anticipation and hype for not only the participants, but also spectators who are not in the game.\n4. Need to find out potential abuse that the players can come out with, namely:\n-How are you going to make sure the players selection are truly random? Will you drop their name thru some online random generator (and make it live)? What kind of participant is considered  qualified? (i.e: Social media account which is of at least 1 month old?)\n-After players are selected, how are you going to make sure that there is no possible *collaboration* among the selected players to rig the game so that everybody will mutually benefit from the outcome of the game?\n-How are you going to prevent the same players from participating multiple times under different account?\n-Etc, etc?\n5. You said the monthly  finale will consist of 4 top players + 2 second placers from weekly game. Am i right to say that there will be a total of 5 games in one month in this order Saturday 1, Saturday 2, Saturday 3, Saturday 4, Sunday 4 (Finale). If that's the case, how are you going to determine which second placers to move on to the finale as there are 8 of them?\n6. Should we maybe merge the final week to just one event such that it become Saturday 1, Saturday 2, Saturday 3, and Sunday 4(Finale). Meaning there is only 3 weekly game per month. That way, we can select all first and second placer winners to qualify for the finale for that month which is exactly 6 players. By doing this, we can also cut down one weekly event and thus reducing the prize pool and saving cost.\n \n\nThat's all i can think of for now, cheers! If the details and kinks can be worked out satisfactorily, i will definitely support this idea.","signature":"aabcfea690ebe8cac3e98c55e8830f31fc70bab77584ac3dffb81918344b2fd6629977ac8210e07192172c38708e1293f59df97b1ae6624cac7613557d72120d","publickey":"a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c","commentid":"4","receipt":"ebb4ee6177796a0e1fea24528b50e89c54e30e023b8db448e8ee4420cb15d954e226cffec242fab48deb1bd538afdbb993b713f0e2d9bae256520a177a9a5c09","timestamp":1596346987,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

In addition, we can consider removing 2nd place and 3rd place prize in the monthly Finale and only have one single Grand Final winner who get all the all the prize of 100DCR.

In a way, the finale should feel a lot more intense than the qualifying weekly event.

Having multiple winners is good for weeklies because it means that more people can win and the prize is more evenly distributed. It is meant for people to feel good because they actually won something no matter how little. We can even expand the winner slots giving consolation prizes to 4th and 5th winner since we have 10 participants.\nBut when it comes to the monthly final,  i think it has to be substantially different from the usual weekly games. Having more stakes, and a lot harder to win the prize and therefore game is a  more intense and less casual compared to the weekly games.\n\nAs for the number,  I'm thinking somewhere along the line of USD1000 (~70DCR) for final and USD500(~35DCR) for weekly pool to begin with.   For example, USD500 can be 250/150/100 or 200/150/100/25/25 if we go to 5th place.\nAssuming, we do 3 weekly and 1 finale, the monthly cost will come to ($500x3) + $1000 = $2500 (175DCR) which a lot more palatable.\nThe initial budget of $4500 per month sounds a little excessive for something experimental and new. We can always increase it later once it gains traction.","signature":"fe4590d3e054b1d1d167f79d48dac5f84301fae79c416bddca4292727d25d716392ef7420993ef5c7b06a6f5b1d345ef9a2f80d252e2d678d3eae7b32734b70f","publickey":"a2f989eabbd68d582510858b6bbf53b6b0be2d981023c21857f885fc947e447c","commentid":"9","receipt":"460b3741a7f731e58321edeb4ba0422ad4a5ab793e5c2a989a52f8e9d8ff4102e1778d5efbf20ed3ecb614c168887eec6adff1a2b3ff4d50de9b33a66121c206","timestamp":1596353447,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This is indeed a way better model.\nWhat would you think of 30 DCR price pool for the weeklies and 70 DCR price pool instead of 70/35?\nThis way we would have a clean number of 100 DCR to win per month. And it's even cheaper. Would be at current prices 1500$, which is a third of what I have initially thought of.","signature":"e55a1bc816966c34a6f55b66c3628fadb4f95d420560050e15991c5002d7c0f7d485487aef2421a13ad0fc90894b80b7883b53ed52407156617836489e89570a","publickey":"16e4a5900b3ad8c4c2c770323e97a30fcaf9bf05da8b0cf9246476adb856054b","commentid":"11","receipt":"d7c94024a917b1bb65620400aa01e2c83e31e9b5746471c469a2ce4ffde20b0a02a301d4045ac69a3af6707e2a17b8c11a01ab587df9085e9c24c582c8ecb104","timestamp":1596363001,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It would be 3 x 30 DCR + 70 DCR, so 160 DCR in total monthly budget.\nI'd find 25 DCR for the weekly and 75 for the final tournament attractive too. That would only be 150 DCR per month.\n\nBut I think there's a threshold of going too low with the total price pools that could decrease the overall interest in the tournaments.\nBut your input of only having 3 weeklies and 1 monthly final gives opportunity to have a bigger price pool per tournament, while less treasury funds are spent.","signature":"091805ce8527bdaf5d98a7c63c0e565d28ab4a447465e62456547604f0e70cf524e3f08951f1698a1f7a067d9efd4bb4cfafc15721a7db16ea2b6a15d1837b0a","publickey":"16e4a5900b3ad8c4c2c770323e97a30fcaf9bf05da8b0cf9246476adb856054b","commentid":"12","receipt":"0e6fa726247c79a18aa2a680729d5875867ca6a48ee193d5ce98dcd9ee51ec50c0b792a9a44b70a08a1365c8d2e5c1b3b96ede837da4a16e14ec8eadffe89808","timestamp":1596366682,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
