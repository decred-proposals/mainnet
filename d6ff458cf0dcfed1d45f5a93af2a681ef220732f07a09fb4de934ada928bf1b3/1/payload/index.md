Decred - A Revolutionary Institution

# Decred - A Revolutionary Institution

## Overview

This proposal follows from the previous submissions.

The aim is to evolve Decred’s positioning to be more focused and impactful, unlocking the narrative potential of the upcoming 1.6 release features including full DAO status, privacy, decentralised treasury and DEX whilst also connecting neatly to much of the already established copy and mission of building a fairer financial system.

It is a rearticulation of everything that already exists, presented in a more concise manner that aims to connect with a wide range of people - inside crypto and out and to provide foundations for increasing awareness and adoption across all aspects of the project.

There is also a simple visualisation attached that outlines an idea for a more aggressive and confident stance to the project, which better reflects the tone of the established community.

## Narrative suggestion

- **Insight** - The functioning of democratic society is dependent on the fact that those in public office are held to high standards of trust, transparency and accountability, whilst the citizens that they represent should have the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association and the right to freedom of speech.

- **Problem** - Digital technologies have super-charged surveillance capitalism, turning users into products and concentrating profit  in an increasingly small number of corporations whose vast power has in turn enabled an increasingly authoritarian establishment to coerce and control their populations through the weakening of legacy institutions.  

- **Solution** - Decred Project is a revolutionary digital institution that protects individual freedoms, empowers collective actions and exists to hold the powerful to account.  

- **How it works pt1** (three key system components that create form the institution) Decentralised Treasury inc DCR, Politeia, DEX   

- **How it works pt2** (detail of how system components work) PoW/PoS security, predictable supply issuance etc etc

**Headline: A Revolutionary Institution.**

Example of how the new website could look is attached - it would  be darker and more confident in tone.

I have added space for a video which I think could also be developed as a subsequent  part of the repositioning.

## Decred's positioning challenge

Right now the Decred Project is caught in a schizophrenic position.

- On one side lie the aspirations of building Fight Club esque financial and organisational machinery to disrupt the function of central banks, the nation state and a oft stated desire to bring down a corrupt establishment.
- It is an us against them mentality that includes the creation of a hazing culture within chat rooms that seeks to dissuade all but the most durable contributors.
- In many ways this combative approach makes sense - Decred is not a ‘soft’ space, there is too much at stake to worry about people’s feelings. This is existential stuff.
- This is a vision where the price is not an overriding worry - as long as devs can be funded long into the future, then there will be the continuing creation of more secure OSS, which can chip away at the big end goal of a fairer financial system.

And on the other,

- The seduction of day-traders, institutional money and profits that would bring and the hope that this will overturn three years of poor price action.
- For the past year the majority of the materials that have been produced and shared within the community reflect this desire to ‘be liked’ by this cohort and/or listed by mainstream exchanges.
- That is not to say that this work is not useful, but bluntly on-chain accounting alone does not make for impactful messaging that can motivate and inspire.

## Breaking down A Revolutionary Institution

The two words play well together and bridge the divide:

- **Revolutionary** - adds excitement, accurately describes the technology and the project culture.
- **Institution** - adds weight, builds a sense of long term commitment, alludes to governance and strong fundamental assurances.  

Together they offer a succinct and relatable proposition that feels cogent with the existing community, differentiates with Bitcoin and can connect to those inside crypto whilst also being relatable to those outside.

## How this attracts investors.

There is a short hand used in crypto-investment circles of 'smart money' - those who invest ahead of the mainstream and where future value with accrue. Investors such as Placeholder and Blue Yard invested in DCR ahead of the market with differing rationales. 

As legacy institutions continue to corrode, democratic ideals are challenged and uncertainty rises, 'smart investors' will be those who increasingly invest based on values, social impact alongside a return on investment. By setting out Decred's status as a Revolutionary Instititution, it will be easier to target and attract aligned capital, rather than just 'smart money'. 

## A note on Stakeholder Governed Sound Money narrative.

As Noah has already noted all crypto-currency projects are stakeholder governed and sound money has limited appeal.

Within the context of a Revolutionary Institution the principle of a predictable issuance is more directly related to principles of ‘platform risk’, a concept used to describe the challenge for developers with building projects on systems whose owners are able to change core elements to a protocol without cause to notify said developers.

Decred’s predictable schedule might be ‘sound money’ but in this context, its assurances relate more clearly to negating worries over platform risk for those who would want to build, govern and work for a truly Revolutionary Institution.

## A note on the DAO narrative

In the last 12 months there has been increasing noise around DAOs, blockchain governance and decentralised treasuries.

As noted [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxul33/metadao_pooling_onchain_funding_for_public_good/) Decred is no longer the only project to have a sizeable block derived fund, nor the only project to offer employment opportunities to on-chain workers who can apply for funding through proposal systems.

It does however have a number of advantages - namely its central focus on privacy, security, transparency and with the DEX, the ability for it to function as a Revolutionary Institution.

Decred does not need to have thousands of developers and millions of hodlers for it to have an outsized impact on the crypto ecosystem and in the real world.

Going forward the project can double-down on its creation of a single Revolutionary Institution (the DecredDAO) and set a vision moving forward to build a network of Revolutionary Institutions that can take a number of forms.

Examples include:

- Decred Working Groups focused on specific initiatives that receive consistent stream funding from the treasury into a multi-sig with a small approved council who can spend the grants, something that is possible today and has been discussed within the community.
- Thinking further forward, there are discussions around subDAOs that leverage sidechains, drivechains and other mechanisms that leverage the mother chain’s security, but enable daughter DAOs that are autonomously funded and governed.

## Examples of how a Revolutionary Institution behaves.

The aim would be to leverage theRevolutionary Institution positioning to attract contributors to both the main project and to initiatives that leverage the underlying infrastructure whilst also acting as ‘marketing’ for the projects mission of building a fairer financial system.

An example of a group who might find use in a Revolutionary Institution:

- Whistleblowers who have sensitive information about corporate corruption and who need to work with a small number or journalists over a long period of time, whilst protecting their anonymity and selectively sharing key information. (See Guardian’s [Securedrop](https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop)).

A multi-sig could be setup and funded for a sustained period, solving one of the key issues with long term investigative reporting and removing accusations of partizanship.
 
In this instance there is also the potential for a publication such as Decred Digest to utilise the established [version control](https://www.coindesk.com/version-control-can-help-the-media-win-back-reader-trust) and innovative multi-party contributor model to piece together the basis for reports whose contents can be verified.

This story would be ‘broken’, providing marketing in line with the project values and then syndicated to mainstream media.  

## Development of final copy

I’ve spent over a year analysing the Decred narrative challenges and have few days writing this and am keen to be involved in further development as a contractor.

I had wanted to get this in as early as possible to get feedback and then would aim to update this proposal with a refined final copy in the next few days.  

## My motivation

I’m interested in networks, narratives and systems change.

I previously published [Forks In The Road](https://github.com/monsieurbulb/forksintheroad/blob/master/Decred_forks_in_the_road.md) which sought to unpack Decred’s culture and appeared on an episode of [Decred In Depth](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/akin-checkmate-mr-bulb-dcr-use-case-growth).

Outside of that I contribute to [Edgeware](https://commonwealth.im) and run a creative studio in London called [Lemonade Money](https://lemonademoney.tv) and spend most of my time down some rabbit hole of one kind or another.

I have not purchased DCR as an investment, only to comment on Pi and as such I don’t have ‘skin in the game’ in the commonly understood way which has consistently confused many in the community. My intention had always been to earn DCR, rather than buy it - it seems that this is the most interesting part of the system.

However, I have skin in the game of the thing we call society and believe that Decred can play a vital role in pushing back against the tide of corruption and misaligned incentives that are compromising our established institutions and as a result I want Decred to succeed.

I see a lot of dumb ideas in crypto - chief amongst them visions of Citadels whose existence is predicated on the collapse of all society into some sort of Mad Max type dystopian misery where those enlightened enough to carry a USB stick will be sovereign individuals atop the burning wreckage of an old order. I'd like to avoid that future.

I have never been a member of MI5 and I find it impossible to make tables work properly in markup hence the reason the costs are at the bottom.

## Costs

Per Noah’s proposal the main costs go into implementation and will be done in collaboration with existing collaborators.

There may well be some more extensive design work to bring alive a more aggressive visual style to the website and I have estimated those below along with a slightly larger implementation budget.

As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. Like Noah I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.

| Item           | Estimated Cost | Maximum Budget |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Design         | 2000               | 2100              |
| Copy            | 400                  | 600                |
| Translation    | 1100           | 1400             |
| Implementation | 1100    | 1500 |
