Decred - An Unstoppable Organisation

# Decred - An Unstoppable Organisation

## Overview

This proposal follows from the previous submissions.

The aim is to evolve Decred’s positioning to be more focused and impactful, unlocking the narrative potential of the upcoming 1.6 release features including full DAO status, privacy, decentralised treasury and DEX whilst also connecting neatly to much of the already established copy. 

It is a rearticulation of everything that already exists, presented in a manner that aims to connect with a wide range of people - inside crypto and out and to provide foundations for increasing awareness and adoption. 

There is also a simple visualisation attached that outlines an idea for a more aggressive and confident stance to the project, which better reflects the tone of the established community. 

## Narrative suggestion 

- **Insight** - The functioning of democratic society is dependent on the fact that those in public office are held to high standards of transparency and accountability, whilst the citizens that they represent should have the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association and the right to freedom of speech. 

- **Problem** - Digital technologies have super-charged surveillance capitalism, turning users into products and concentrating profit  in an increasingly small number of corporations whose vast power has in turn enabled authoritarian leaders to coerce and control their populations, making the funding and coordination of initiatives that seek to challenge the status quo increasingly difficult and dangerous. 

- **Solution** - Decred Project is building foundations for unstoppable organisations that are  sustainably funded and transparently governed through secure and adaptable coordination mechanisms designed to protect individual freedoms, empower collective actions and hold the powerful to account. 

- **How it works pt1** (three key system components) Politeia, Decentralised Treasury, DEX   

- **How it works pt2** (detail of how system components work) PoW/PoS security, predictable supply issuance etc etc

**Headline: An Unstoppable Organisation.** 

Example of how the new website could look is attached - it would  be darker and more confident in tone. I have added space for a video which I think could also be developed as part of a repositioning.

## A note on Stakeholder Governed Sound Money narrative.

As Noah has already noted all crypto-currency projects are stakeholder governed and sound money has limited appeal.

Within the context of Unstoppable Organisations (UOs), the principle of a predictable issuance is more directly related to principles of ‘platform risk’, a concept used to describe the challenge for developers with building projects on systems whose owners are able to change core elements to a protocol without cause to notify said developers. 

Decred’s predictable schedule might be ‘sound money’ but in this context, its assurances relate more clearly to negating worries over platform risk for those who would want to build, govern and work for truly Unstoppable Organisations. 

## A note on the DAO narrative

In the last 12 months there has been increasing noise around DAOs, blockchain governance and decentralised treasuries. 

As noted [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxul33/metadao_pooling_onchain_funding_for_public_good/) Decred is no longer the only project to have a sizeable block derived fund, nor the only project to offer employment opportunities to on-chain workers who can apply for funding through proposal systems.

It does however have a number of advantages - namely its central focus on privacy, security, transparency and with the DEX, the ability for it to function as an Unstoppable Organisation. 

Decred does not need to have thousands of developers and millions of hodlers for it to have an outsized impact on the crypto ecosystem and in the real world. 

Instead the project can double-down on its creation of a single Unstoppable Organisation (the DecredDAO) and set a vision moving forward to build a network of Unstoppable Organisations that can take a number of forms. 

Examples include: 

- Decred Working Groups focused on specific initiatives that receive consistent stream funding from the treasury into a multi-sig with a small approved council who can spend the grants, something that is possible today and has been discussed within the community.
- Thinking further forward, there are discussions around subDAOs that leverage sidechains, drivechains and other mechanisms that leverage the mother chain’s security, but enable daughter UOs that are autonomously funded and governed.

## Examples of Unstoppable Organisations

The aim would be to leverage the UO positioning to attract contributors to both the main project and to initiatives that leverage the underlying infrastructure whilst also acting as ‘marketing’ for the projects mission of building a fairer financial system.

An example of a group who might find use in UOs:

- Whistleblowers who have sensitive information about corporate corruption and who need to work with a small number or journalists over a long period of time, whilst protecting their anonymity and selectively sharing key information. (See Guardian’s [Securedrop](https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop)).

A UO could be setup and funded for a sustained period, solving one of the key issues with long term investigative reporting and removing accusations of partizanship. 
 
In this instance there is also the potential for a publication such as Decred Digest to utilise the established [version control](https://www.coindesk.com/version-control-can-help-the-media-win-back-reader-trust) and innovative multi-party contributor model to piece together the basis for reports whose contents can be verified.

This story would be ‘broken’ by the UO and then syndicated to mainstream media.  

## Unstoppable F. Organisations (the meme)

If Decred took a more aggressive stance about its technological capabilities and assurances then there might be fun to be had with establishing Decred a home for UFOs aka Unstoppable Fucking Organisations. 

Adding some humour to the project, whilst reinforcing the technologies core capabilities will allow the project’s community to appeal to a more internet native aesthetic. 

## Estimated costs + help required from others

I’ve spent over a year analysing the Decred narrative challenges and have few days writing this and am keen to be involved in further development as a contractor though I am aware that there are some in the community who still view my interactions with suspicion and so this might not be viable.

I am happy to co-create the new copy with the community. 

I have included a donation address - I’m interested in the many ways ‘rewards’ can manifest in decentralised communities and I do have to eat.

## My motivation

I’m interested in networks, narratives and systems change. 

I previously published [Forks In The Road](https://github.com/monsieurbulb/forksintheroad/blob/master/Decred_forks_in_the_road.md) which sought to unpack Decred’s culture and appeared on an episode of [Decred In Depth](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/akin-checkmate-mr-bulb-dcr-use-case-growth). 

Outside of that I contribute to [Edgeware](https://commonwealth.im) and run a creative studio in London called [Lemonade Money](https://lemonademoney.tv) and spend most of my time down some rabbit hole of one kind or another.

I have not purchased DCR as an investment, only to comment on Pi and as such I don’t have ‘skin in the game’ in the commonly understood way which has consistently confused many in the community. My intention had always been to earn DCR, rather than buy it - it seems that this is the most interesting part of the system. 

However, I have skin in the game of the thing we call society and believe that Decred can play a vital role in pushing back against the tide of corruption and misaligned incentives that are compromising our established institutions and as a result I want Decred to succeed. 

I see a lot of dumb ideas in crypto - chief amongst them visions of Citadels whose existence is predicated on the collapse of all society into some sort of Mad Max type dystopian misery where those enlightened enough to carry a USB stick will be sovereign individuals atop the burning wreckage of an old order. I'd like to avoid that future. 

I have never been a member of MI5 and I find it impossible to make tables work properly in markup hence the reason the costs are at the bottom.

## Costs

Per Noah’s proposal the main costs go into implementation and will be done in collaboration with existing collaborators. 

There may well be some more extensive design work to bring alive a more aggressive visual style to the website and I have estimated those below along with a slightly larger implementation budget. 

As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. Like Noah I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.

| Item           | Estimated Cost | Maximum Budget |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Design         | 2000               | 2500              |
| Copy            | 400                  | 600                |
| Translation    | 1100           | 1400             |
| Implementation | 1100    | 1500 |
| Total             | 4100           | 5400           |
