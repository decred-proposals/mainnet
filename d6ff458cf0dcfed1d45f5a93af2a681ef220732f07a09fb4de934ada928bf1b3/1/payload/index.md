Decred - A Revolutionary Decentralised Institution

# Decred - A Revolutionary Decentralised Institution

## Overview

This proposal follows from the previous submissions.

The aim is to evolve Decred’s positioning to be more focused and impactful, unlocking the narrative potential of both the existing infrastructure (Politeia, DCR etc) upcoming 1.6 release features including full DAO status, privacy, decentralised treasury and DEX whilst also connecting neatly to much of the already established copy and mission of building a fairer financial system.

It is a rearticulation of everything that already exists, presented in a more concise manner that aims to connect with a wide range of people - inside crypto and out and to provide foundations for increasing awareness and adoption across all aspects of the project.

There is also a simple visualisation attached that outlines an idea for a more aggressive and confident stance to the project, which better reflects the tone of the established community.

## Decred's positioning challenge

Right now Decred is caught between two worlds:

- On one side lies an agressive Fight Club esque spirit and mission to disrupt the function of central banks and a desire to bring down a corrupt establishment.
- It is an us against them mentality and in many ways this combative approach makes sense - Decred is not a ‘soft’ space, there is too much at stake to worry about people’s feelings. 
- This is a vision where the price is not an overriding worry - as long as devs can be funded long into the future, then there will be the continuing creation of more secure OSS, which can chip away at the big end goal of a fairer financial system.

And on the other,

- The seduction of day-traders, institutional money and the profits that would bring - wen moon?
- The vast majority of recent research materials produced and shared within the community reflect this desire to ‘be liked’ by this more mercenary cohort and/or listed by mainstream exchanges.
- That is not to say that this work is not useful, but bluntly on-chain accounting alone does not make for impactful messaging that can motivate and inspire.

In the end, a good solution should aim to abstract complexity and condense the project's ideas and ideals into the simplest  possible statement that can play to both, whilst still adding excitement without resorting to empty hype tactics. From this high concept more detailed explaination can flow.

## Narrative suggestion

- **Insight** - The functioning of democratic society is dependent on elected officials in public office and in corporations being held to high standards of transparency and accountability when setting policy for the constituents they are elected to represent. 

- **Problem** - Surveillance capitalism has turned users into products, resulting in profits concentrating in an increasingly small number of corporations whose vast power has enabled an increasingly opaque and authoritarian establishment to coerce and control their populations whilst weakening already outdated institutions.  

- **Solution** - Decred is a revolutionary decentralised institution designed to protect individual freedoms, empower collective actions and build a fairer financial system.  

- **How it works pt1** (three key system components that of the institution) Adaptable (Pi). Sustainable (Treasury). Secure. (DEX).

- **How it works pt2** (detail of how system core components work) PoW/PoS security, predictable supply issuance etc etc

### **Headline: A Revolutionary Decentralised Institution.**

## Breaking down A Revolutionary Decentralised Institution

The three words can bridge the divide and provide stepping stones to more detailed explainations:

- **Revolutionary** - adds excitement, accurately describes the technology and the project culture.
- **Decentralised** - it's a core project ethos and also signals how Decred is different to legacy institutions.
- **Institution** - adds weight, alludes to governance, capital formation, strong fundamental assurances and the sense of a long time horizon. 

Together they offer a succinct and relatable proposition that feels cogent with the existing community, differentiates with Bitcoin and can connect to those inside crypto whilst also being relatable to those outside.

## How this attracts investors.

There is a short hand used in crypto-investment circles of 'smart money' - those who invest ahead of the mainstream and where future value will accrue. 

As legacy institutions continue to corrode, democratic ideals are challenged and uncertainty rises, 'smart investors' will be those who increasingly back projects based on shared values, mission and social impact. By setting out Decred's status as a Revolutionary Decentralised Instititution, it will be easier to target and attract aligned capital who share an understanding of the importance of the mission. 

## A note on Stakeholder Governed Sound Money narrative.

As Noah has already noted all crypto-currency projects are stakeholder governed and sound money has limited appeal - certainly as website lede. 

Within the context of a Revolutionary Decentralised Institution the principle of a predictable issuance can also be directly related to an understanding of an institution by definition being something that is necessarily built on strong and sound foundations. Sound money, sound software, sound instrastructure... 

## A note on the DAO narrative

In the last 12 months there has been increasing noise around DAOs, blockchain governance and decentralised treasuries.

As noted [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxul33/metadao_pooling_onchain_funding_for_public_good/) Decred is no longer the only project to have a sizeable block derived fund, nor the only project to offer employment opportunities to on-chain workers who can apply for funding through proposal systems.

It does however have a number of advantages - namely its central focus on privacy, security, transparency and with the DEX, the ability for it to function as a Revolutionary Institution.

Decred does not need to have thousands of developers and millions of hodlers for it to have an outsized impact on the crypto ecosystem and in the real world.

Going forward the project has the potential to double-down on its creation of a single Revolutionary Decentralised Institution (the DecredDAO) and set a vision moving forward to build a network of Revolutionary Institutions that can take a number of forms.

Examples include:

- Decred Working Groups focused on specific initiatives that receive consistent stream funding from the treasury into a multi-sig with a small approved council who can spend the grants, something that is possible today and has been discussed within the community.
- Thinking further forward, there are discussions around subDAOs that leverage sidechains, drivechains and other mechanisms that leverage the mother chain’s security, but enable daughter DAOs that are autonomously funded and governed.

## Examples of how a Revolutionary Decentralised Institution might 'market' itself.

The aim would be to leverage the positioning to attract contributors to both the main project and to initiatives that leverage the underlying infrastructure whilst also acting as ‘marketing’ for the projects mission of building a fairer financial system.

An example of a group who might find use in a Revolutionary Decentralised Institution:

- Whistleblowers who have sensitive information about corporate corruption and who need to work with a small number or journalists over a long period of time, whilst protecting their anonymity and selectively sharing key information. (See Guardian’s [Securedrop](https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop)).

A multi-sig could be setup and funded for a sustained period, solving one of the key issues with long term investigative reporting and removing accusations of partizanship.
 
In this instance there is also the potential for a publication such as Decred Digest to utilise the established [version control](https://www.coindesk.com/version-control-can-help-the-media-win-back-reader-trust) and innovative multi-party contributor model to piece together the basis for reports whose contents can be verified.

This story would be ‘broken’, providing marketing in line with the project values and then syndicated to mainstream media.  

## Development of final copy

I’ve spent over a year analysing the Decred narrative challenges and have few days writing this and am keen to be involved in further development as a contractor.

I had wanted to get this in as early as possible to get feedback and then would aim to update this proposal with a refined final copy in the next few days.  

## My motivation

I’m interested in networks, narratives and systems change.

I previously published [Forks In The Road](https://github.com/monsieurbulb/forksintheroad/blob/master/Decred_forks_in_the_road.md) which sought to unpack Decred’s culture and appeared on an episode of [Decred In Depth](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/akin-checkmate-mr-bulb-dcr-use-case-growth).

Outside of that I contribute to [Edgeware](https://commonwealth.im) and run a creative studio in London called [Lemonade Money](https://lemonademoney.tv) and spend most of my time down some rabbit hole of one kind or another.

## Costs

Per Noah’s proposal the main costs go into implementation and will be done in collaboration with existing collaborators.

There may be some design work to bring alive a more confident visual style to the website, though this design update is just a suggestion and should not change the website materially. I have estimated those costs along with a slightly larger implementation budget.

The video is again just to outline an idea for later but thought it was worth including for reference.

As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. Like Noah I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.
