Decred - Building Revolutionary Infrastructure 

# Decred - Building Revolutionary Infrastructure

## Overview

This proposal follows from the previous submissions. 

The aim is to evolve Decred’s positioning to be more focused and impactful, unlocking the narrative potential of both the existing infrastructure (Politeia, DCR etc) upcoming 1.6 release features including full DAO status, privacy, decentralised treasury and DEX whilst also connecting neatly to much of the already established copy and mission of building a fairer financial system.

It is a rearticulation of everything that already exists, presented in a more concise manner that aims to connect with a wide range of people - inside crypto and out and to provide foundations for increasing awareness and adoption across all aspects of the project.

There is also a simple visualisation attached that outlines an idea for a more aggressive and confident stance to the project, which better reflects the tone of the established community. There are also mockups in the existing style.

A strategic rationale is offered after a summary of the key changes.

## Summary of changes

The tagline would change to: **Building Revolutionary Infrastructure** 

Underneath the tagline, above the boxes for different themes, the following would be added:

> Decred is an sustainably funded open source software project, coordinating a decentralized community of stakeholders to build a secure and adaptable payments network, creating foundations for a fairer financial future.

This proposal would add a new element to the explanation of Decred on decred.org: Fair

Where the string "Secure. Adaptable. Sustainable." appears, this will be replaced by " Secure. Adaptable. Fair."

This theme will have a box on the front page (appearing at the top of the homepage) and its own page, as with Secure, Adaptable and Sustainable.

Box copy:

> **Fair**

> The Decred network is available to all, and the rules are the same for everyone. Decred is governed by its stakeholders, who time-lock some of their DCR for voting tickets, and use these to chart a course for Decred's future.

> Links at the bottom:

> Read More About Building a Fairer Financial System

> Read the Decred Constitution

> Read about the Decred Airdrop and Founders' Reward

> Read about free Decred Decentralized Exchange

## Fair page copy

> Contributors to Decred have a shared ambition, to build a fairer financial system by leveraging open source cryptocurrency software. Decentralized Credits (DCR) are the currency of this fairer financial system, everyone can own and use them - and have a voice in governance of the network if they choose to.

- Removed 'Decred project' (_project_ not mentioned elsewhere)

>**The Fiat Currency Game is Rigged**

> Our national fiat currencies and associated payment rails are controlled by banks and public institutions that are not native to the internet. Cryptocurrency is about producing an alternative infrastructure for money, which is less susceptible to being captured and controlled by a small group because it is decentralized and permissionless. Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin, which relies on transparent distributed records and a game of computational power to ensure that everyone follows the rules and the network as a whole operates as intended. The consensus rules of the network bind all of its users together, and they stipulate an issuance schedule for the currency. The distributed network and permissionless, mining means it is difficult to stop or censor someone's transactions as long as they follow the network's rules.

- Removed elites. Changed to _not native to the internet_ 
- Removed second elite. Changed to _which is less susceptible to being captured and controlled by a small group_

> **Blockchain Governance Matters**

> Cryptocurrency networks rely on their software to enforce the rules of the network, known as consensus rules, because it is consensus on how to apply these rules that keeps the network together and strong. Software must be continuously maintained and improved, for cryptocurrencies this means that sometimes the consensus rules need to be amended. Decred was founded on the insight that governance is a major challenge for decentralized networks, because there are many competing interests when it comes to making changes. Decred's solution was to include a formal method of making these decisions from the beginning, so that new users know from the outset how its governance works, transparently managing expectations.

> **Aligned Incentives, Skin in the Game**

> Decred's position is that the best way to decentralize governance of a cryptocurrency is to distribute decision-making power among the people who hold its asset - DCR in this case. However, giving voting rights to everyone who is holding DCR and could immediately sell it is open to abuse. Therefore Decred's design introduced a requirement that in order to participate in Proof-of-Stake voting a user must time-lock some of their DCR to secure a ticket. When stakeholders use DCR to secure a ticket, they cannot spend it until that ticket has voted - which can take up to 142 days. For more information about Proof-of-Stake voting, see the documentation site.

> **Fair Exchange**

> The process of exchanging cryptocurrencies has historically been a source of many issues where users of centralized services have been exploited. To address issues of fairness and privacy in the exchange process, Decred's Treasury has been funding the development of decentralized exchange infrastructure (check out dcrdex on GitHub). Decred stakeholders have the means, and will, to tackle systemic issues in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

**Box footer text**:

> Learn about Decred's rules, which are the same for everyone, and put the holders of decentralized credits in charge of running the network.

## Decred's positioning challenge

Right now Decred is caught between two worlds:

- On one side lies an agressive Fight Club esque spirit and mission to disrupt the function of central banks and a desire to bring down a corrupt establishment.
- It is an us against them mentality and in many ways this combative approach makes sense - Decred is not a ‘soft’ space, there is too much at stake to worry about people’s feelings. 
- This is a vision where the price is not an overriding worry - as long as devs can be funded long into the future, then there will be the continuing creation of more secure OSS, which can chip away at the big end goal of a fairer financial system.

And on the other,

- The seduction of day-traders, institutional money and the profits that would bring - wen moon?
- The vast majority of recent research materials produced and shared within the community reflect this desire to ‘be liked’ by this more mercenary cohort and/or listed by mainstream exchanges.
- That is not to say that this work is not useful, but bluntly on-chain accounting alone does not make for impactful messaging that can motivate and inspire.

In the end, a good solution should aim to abstract complexity and condense the project's ideas and ideals into the simplest  possible statement that can play to both, whilst still adding excitement without resorting to empty hype tactics. From this high concept more detailed explaination can flow.

## Narrative suggestion

- **Insight** - The functioning of democratic society is dependent on elected officials in public office and in corporations being held to high standards of transparency and accountability when setting policy for the constituents they are elected to represent. 

- **Problem** - Surveillance capitalism has turned users into products, resulting in profits concentrating in an increasingly small number of corporations whose vast power has enabled an increasingly opaque and authoritarian establishment to coerce and control their populations whilst weakening already outdated institutions.  

- **Solution** - Decred builds revolutionary infrastructure designed to protect individual freedoms, empower collective actions and build a fairer financial system.  

- **How it works pt1** (three key pieces of infrastructure) Adaptable (Pi). Sustainable (Treasury). Secure. (DEX).

- **How it works pt2** (detail of how system core components work) PoW/PoS security, predictable supply issuance etc etc

## Breaking down Building Revolutionary Infrastructure

The three words can bridge the divide and provide stepping stones to more detailed explainations:

- **Builds** - focuses on decred's engineering culture. 
- **Revolutionary** - adds excitement, accurately describes the technology and the project culture.
- **Infrastructure** - adds weight, alludes to governance, capital formation, strong fundamental assurances, long term thinking.

Together they offer a succinct and relatable proposition that feels cogent with the existing community, differentiates with Bitcoin and can connect to those inside crypto whilst also being relatable to those outside.

## Costs

Per Noah’s proposal the main costs go into implementation and will be done in collaboration with existing collaborators.

There may be some design work to bring alive a more confident visual style to the website, though this design update is just a suggestion and should not change the website materially. I have estimated those costs along with a slightly larger implementation budget.

The video is again just to outline an idea for later but thought it was worth including for reference.

As decred.org has 12 languages, this new copy would have to be translated 11 times. Like Noah I used the estimate of $100 for each translation by Richard Red.

| Item           | Estimated Cost | Maximum Budget |
|:----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Design         | 1800           | 2000           |
| Copy           | 400            | 600            |
| Translation    | 1100           | 1400           |
| Implementation | 1000           | 1000           |
| Total          | 4300           | 5000           |

## About me

I’m interested in networks, narratives and systems change.

I previously published [Forks In The Road](https://github.com/monsieurbulb/forksintheroad/blob/master/Decred_forks_in_the_road.md) which sought to unpack Decred’s culture and appeared on an episode of [Decred In Depth](https://decredindepth.libsyn.com/akin-checkmate-mr-bulb-dcr-use-case-growth).

Outside of that I contribute to [Edgeware](https://commonwealth.im) where there is a EDG x DCR working group figuring out ways to collaborate and run a creative studio in London called [Lemonade Money](https://lemonademoney.tv) and spend most of my time down some rabbit hole of one kind or another.
