Is $DCR the token/asset/currency/commodity, the money bit? Is Pi part of the monetary system? \n\nWhen we compare the Federal Reserve and the USD. Which bit is the institution (the whole system) and which bit is the money? \nWhen USD was backed by gold, was this not the 'sound money' bit? \nWas the Federal Reserve itself called 'sound money'? \n\nWorking with your suggestion: \n\n## A Revolutionary Decentralised Institution \n*Decred's system is designed to protect against lost of purchasing power, empower individual freedoms and build a fairer financial system'*\n\nThen you get into 'sound money' in the next step where you explain **how** Decred protects against a loss of purchasing power... through sound money, which can then step into further detail such as the predictable issuance / detail.\n\nThe issue is that right now Decred does not protect against a loss of purchasing power since it has been steadily losing value in USD terms. In that regard, this trait is a hope for the future and isn't a claim that can be made today with any credibility.\n\nHowever when you stick it all together into a bundle, you do have something that looks and feels very much like a revolutionary institution.","signature":"89190d94040575a8bd56e498cf853ceffa2bd6304cf6d7ca8f7860b3ece4dc84d184efaa64c1a7ae1c3869a5ee550eb047aa9849d8632f94b48a09ef23a2ee0d","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"2","receipt":"d18ed749e8c2cc3f3dfaf328898c27faad8df9e3cdb5414fd39c108783d24fedf490b22b7498d9651fb21dd7f62d6f9b277c56e7e9dc7a179a89ccc63c543501","timestamp":1601310279,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
