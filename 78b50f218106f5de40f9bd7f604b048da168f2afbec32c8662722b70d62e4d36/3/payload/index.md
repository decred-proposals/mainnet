Decred Fundamental Metrics Research Proposal - Phase 1




This Pi Proposal summarises the objectives, strategies and focus areas for a series of data-driven research papers into the fundamentals of Decred. Each piece of analysis will be coupled with a strong social media dissemination campaign to enhance market awareness and community education and engagement.

This is the first Phase of what may become a much larger campaign and opens pathways for more detailed research, collaboration and engagement strategies for Decred.

## Proposal Objectives
Decred is a project which is remarkably undervalued by the market yet has an extremely robust set of fundamental metrics. 

The primary goal of this research proposal is to present these fundamentals in easily digestable but rigorous, data evidenced format for community reference and education. It is hoped that this research will help consolidate community knowledge and supplement the growing body of work exploring Decreds strengths. 

The core objectives of this proposal are:

1. Develop a series of research articles on key Decred fundamentals and mechanisms of **Security, Scarcity and SoV properties**.
2. Provide **data driven rigour and evidence** supporting Decred's SoV characteristics.
3. Enhance the level of **community education and engagement** regarding Decred fundamentals.
4. Establish **momentum with social media** presence to support dissemination of the aformentioned research with a focus on positive, constructive discussion.

## Topics of Research
For Phase 1, the analysis and research will focus on exploring the unique value propositions of Decred from a data driven perspective specifically focused on SoV properties. The dominant source of data will be from analysis of on-chain signatures of transaction flow, network value and ticket behaviour (data sources e.g. coinmetrics.io and dcrdata.org). 

It is expected that Phase 1 will be conceptual level research that establishes core observations and data relationships (i.e. follow the data). This likely lead to further analysis, research and contribution in later Phases.

Examples of topics for Phase 1 research:

1. **Tickets as a scarce asset** as a [follow up to the Monetary Premiums article](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/monetary-premiums-can-altcoins-compete-with-bitcoin-54c97a92c6d4).

2. Further analysis into the **Scarcity Mechanisms** which lead to Decred's observed monetary premium.

3. Quantifying Ticket lockup as Decred's **Sleeper Halving**.

4. **On-chain Analysis Fractals** of Decred - e.g. studying the fractals and relationships between tickets, coin movements, network valuations etc.

## Marketing and Dissemination
Articles will be delivered and disseminated via:

1. **Medium** as the primary formal issuance platform.
2. **Github** open source repositories for articles, data analysis and code for transparency.
3. Social media campaigns to promote the findings including **Telegram, Twitter and Matrix** in coordination with the Decred team.

Social campaigns which have recently yielded positive community feedback have a focus on evidence based fundamentals and positive, constructive commentary. Examples are *#DecredChallenge, #GetDecrEducated* and *#DontSleepOnDecred*.

## Contributers
I ([Checkmate](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_)) will lead the analysis and research however see a great opportunity to collaborate with the Decred team and become increasingly involved in the project. Please let me know in the comments if you are interested to contribute and/or see additional opportunities.

There is an opportunity to leverage experience and knowledge from thinkers in the space who have already developed valuable Decred insights (Richard Red, Permabull Nino, Murad Mahmadov, Zubair Zia et al.)

I have limited coding experience however see an opportunity to develop python scripts (or other language) for calling APIs, developing charting packages and querying on-chain metrics. This will be a personal development goal where I can draw on experience of the team (#GetOffExcel). 

## Future Opportunties
It is expected that this Phase will establish an initial set of core observations and relationships at a conceptual level. Further research such as deep dives and more granular analysis of the on-chain behaviour is an opportunity for future research. Additionally, performance of DCR through market cycles will add additional data-points for analysis.

It is possible that a Decred product may be built off dcrdata once the core on-chain concepts and metrics are established from this and similar research (similar to what Woobull.com has done for Bitcoin).

## Risks
Potential risks to budget and delivery are:
- This is my first Decred proposal/project and thus may have some teething issues. I anticipate this as a part-time contribution for now and will make sure to engage with the team on strategy and direction.
- On-chain signatures may not yield significant signal as yet (low chain Tx volume) thus having less convincing impact. Based on preliminary study, it appears tickets are a key link here and thus will be a centrepiece to this Phase. Decred community feedback will be sought prior to all issued articles for comment.
- Data for on-chain analysis for this phase will be reliant on API calls and public data and assumes the data is available and reliable (such as coinmetrics.io and dcrdata.org).

## Timing and Budget
### Primary budget
I propose a total budget of $12,000 to account for 3months of research and social media campaign presence. At a minimum, the research component will establish a baseline subset of concepts, ideas and articles exploring Decred's fundamentals to springboard later Phases of research. It is expected that fleshed out and peer/Decred-community reviewed articles can be delivered on at least 2-3 key topics with many more 'bite sized Ã­deas' spread via social media presence.

This budget will include a consistent stream of social media engagement campaigns focused on education, constructive debate and community engagement following the research journey.

It is assumed that this Proposal has an effective start-end date from end of July to end of Oct 2019 at which point a follow-up proposal can be submitted. Two primary Milestones are proposed of a minimum of one research article delivered end of Sept and another end of Oct for review and publication.

### Budget in Arrears
If deemed appropriate, a budget in arrears of $2,000 is requested for 1 month of research which was undertaken for the [Monetary Premiums article](https://medium.com/@_Checkmatey_/monetary-premiums-can-altcoins-compete-with-bitcoin-54c97a92c6d4) and initiation of the aformentioned social media campaigns which have since seen wide distribution and adoption within the Decred community. (Edit 19/7 - Stakeholders may view this budget allocation as a benchmark for what can be expected from my part-time workflow on a $ per delivery basis, rather than provision of $/hr rate which often is not representative)

## Closing Comments

As this is my first Decred proposal, I welcome any and all feedback, suggestions, expectations and improvements. 

It's great to be here.
