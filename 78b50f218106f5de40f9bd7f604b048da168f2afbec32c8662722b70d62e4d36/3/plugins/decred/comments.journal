While there is some scope for Checkmate and I to collaborate on the [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f), Checkmate's research interests and skills are quite different to mine. Checkmate shared a bullet-point list of subjects they would like to cover, and I suggested to develop it into a proposal and pursue it independently (if the proposal is approved).\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, this approach makes more sense to me than trying to fit Checkmate's research into the open source research program. Having the proposed work be part of the established program would make me responsible for deciding which aspects are worthwhile and for overseeing the work, and I would be accountable for those decisions when it's time for the next open source research proposal. This would not be a great setup for anyone. Checkmate's approach is different enough to my own that it should have its own proposal and be evaluated independently. \n\nI will be voting Yes, I think $2,000 is reasonable for the work already done and a further $12,000 should provide enough runway to develop this approach and for us to see how it progresses - which can inform stakeholder voting on any subsequent proposal.\n\nIn general, this approach of approving budgets for specific research programs led by specific individuals or small groups feels like a good fit to me. The nature of research is such that one can't guarantee what the outcome will look like, as it will depend on how the research unfolds. Therefore I think it makes sense to handle funding on the basis of programs where specific individuals/groups lead research efforts in specific areas, with proposals that span fairly short periods of time (3-12 months) and are therefore regularly reviewed by stakeholders.","signature":"179b4817df2fee9d6b8155bcedbd15b0b03c0fd7e0d0b48944c160073e3369b914e29c65cf2834e3e948ebcf845daa6e46e3febfa7f62331b762528b531ca103","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"180b5e3c61413a26eeafbfad39ec73e5f77199699821a251211ae1ab134bb231072702199e3dbd1d15a334e8bce10a5eaeaa7a13d6b0ecfc5690a6c8fb9a7700","timestamp":1563457016,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

He represents the contractor process in action, by which he has done an exceptional amount of research to understand Decred, it's culture, values, and processes, and he has taken explicit actions and delivered for the project.\n\nCheckmate has made valuable contributions to growing awareness of Decred on social media, and his published work on Medium has been of high quality and has created a strong following.\n\nThe scope of his work is extremely complimentary to the existing approved work in marketing, events and research, and the assets will be repurposable. Additionally, his research will make a strong case in a way that has not been presented to this point. This will help increase our reach and grow our community more quickly.\n\nI'm glad to have Checkmate, and I'm optimistic the community also supports his efforts.","signature":"e121776a17284f276c061ad616b26ec8accdead513e8a3c4bc761845e78e623717114a3997f983ea73195dc5fcb3d44c21bf23d337c6d4ca3c5bda3dae59570d","publickey":"2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","commentid":"2","receipt":"6ed0e8ded42c6e88718dc27b9c95845d9f3cc190f08f03250d920913a22bf407932317b809cb64c8a83d74d2d258b6763b7f707ce4604c76e160cc179186a10d","timestamp":1563459783,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Denni's [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd) asking for payment in arrears was a corner case resulting from his going way over budget before he became a contractor as a means to recoup that work (and I haven't seen him around for a while...). Checkmate's situation is of being the first to go through the proper process of becoming a contractor with the expectation of needing stakeholder approval for his funding. \n\nThe basic official contractor path (or the traditional one anyway, which hasn't been changed afaik), is:\n\n1. Work and demonstrate value\n2. Ask to become a contractor (or be asked)\n3. In your first invoice, bill in arrears for the free work you did knowing you may never get paid for it (i.e. you proved skin-in-the-game by taking on risk, and get rewarded if that bet pays off). I think this is fair, and an important value proposition to new contractors who are already making a large leap of faith by doing what can be a large amount of work for free (and that can happen). \n\nI think the amount asked for is reasonable, especially considering his work has already proved popular/valuable (e.g. already it has been included in an [investment thesis](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis), presumably by people buying into DCR and increasing the price). What's new here is that this process is now going through stakeholder approval, not just the normal invoicing process. Would be curious to know if there has been a change in process, or if this is just checkmate wanting to err on the side of transparency and giving the stakeholders an avenue to voice their opinion on the matter. \n\nTo add a data point to this, when I went through the process of becoming a contract (back in October, right as Politeia was launching), I decided not to bill in arrears for prior work I'd done, even though I was told I could and it was a decent chunk of work, because I was very eager to impress and grateful for the opportunity. However, I also realized that that possibility/promise of getting paid for that work was a big factor in my deciding to take the plunge and go for it. And I told myself that if I had the opportunity to speak up for this practice generally I would take it, hence this comment. \n\nAm curious to hear any stakeholder opinions on this.","signature":"cc88288586e93c12dda893ea1c396f9e8f4ffa25aa46dbfeef4f521025ac9bdac76fbebf482c3bb9ae6f96463c70061c9f33585a4690417c4cf6b83e98066a06","publickey":"1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","commentid":"7","receipt":"60bd46dfad1f04203a277f23a3c1b3643769dc8b88de28dea931ee70001d4125e22c59a30245f14c65ff7cc577fe5a91d53fd4d2a92a0f1c4ada744c16aa450d","timestamp":1563577013,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Quite frankly, this person is a breath of fresh air and has already proved value within the community.  I had been periodically checking $DRC \u0026 #decred tags on Twitter and while there are dedicated individuals consistently posting, Checkmate has gotten quite a bit of attention directed at Decred and some of the highest engagement levels per tweet I've seen relating to this project in a long time.  I also appreciate their willingness to engage with all sorts, including those critical of the project, and have civilized discussion.  Not that this is anything new, as most Decred folk I've noticed are extremely civilized in discourse, but people like this are amazing for PR awareness and representing what I hope to be the average caliber of person invested in this project. \n\nIt also goes without saying that the research that Checkmate has put forth is also fantastic and I look forward to seeing what is to come in the future.  The research alone is worth the $12,000 being asked.  The previous paragraph is why I think the $2000 in arrears is also well worth it.  Not only have they put out great research but they have been extremely active on Twitter raising awareness and promoting the project in a positive light.  I understand why we want to be careful in setting precedence for arrears, but in this case the quality of work is so high that I think anybody who has read Checkmate's work and seen them on Twitter knows that the extra $2000 will be minuscule compared to the amount of value that has been provided and that will be provided in the future.  Thanks for your hard work Checkmate.  I will be voting yes =)","signature":"e8a64feb760e9eadf45658f56ee69536a7c3f497a5c2b1f4ccbfae234bad045135ca66f21757c49281688274dba542eb20de6fb21de537fc2d55c0b292128f0b","publickey":"a38a5b0287e87afb4b5363e1069b20d3abd3d7e98e757a70552753505d38dfd6","commentid":"9","receipt":"7476b26635dfcdc2dd23e89adcc1033b04d03a076343d81e2e08c1145eb353b2e057427f922977c7f473022801e07c8f37fcc3374146b60f5a60346ab70b9e0a","timestamp":1563663954,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
