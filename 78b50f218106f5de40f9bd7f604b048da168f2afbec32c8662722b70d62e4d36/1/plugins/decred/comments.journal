While there is some scope for Checkmate and I to collaborate on the [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f), Checkmate's research interests and skills are quite different to mine. Checkmate shared a bullet-point list of subjects they would like to cover, and I suggested to develop it into a proposal and pursue it independently (if the proposal is approved).\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, this approach makes more sense to me than trying to fit Checkmate's research into the open source research program. Having the proposed work be part of the established program would make me responsible for deciding which aspects are worthwhile and for overseeing the work, and I would be accountable for those decisions when it's time for the next open source research proposal. This would not be a great setup for anyone. Checkmate's approach is different enough to my own that it should have its own proposal and be evaluated independently. \n\nI will be voting Yes, I think $2,000 is reasonable for the work already done and a further $12,000 should provide enough runway to develop this approach and for us to see how it progresses - which can inform stakeholder voting on any subsequent proposal.\n\nIn general, this approach of approving budgets for specific research programs led by specific individuals or small groups feels like a good fit to me. The nature of research is such that one can't guarantee what the outcome will look like, as it will depend on how the research unfolds. Therefore I think it makes sense to handle funding on the basis of programs where specific individuals/groups lead research efforts in specific areas, with proposals that span fairly short periods of time (3-12 months) and are therefore regularly reviewed by stakeholders.","signature":"179b4817df2fee9d6b8155bcedbd15b0b03c0fd7e0d0b48944c160073e3369b914e29c65cf2834e3e948ebcf845daa6e46e3febfa7f62331b762528b531ca103","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"180b5e3c61413a26eeafbfad39ec73e5f77199699821a251211ae1ab134bb231072702199e3dbd1d15a334e8bce10a5eaeaa7a13d6b0ecfc5690a6c8fb9a7700","timestamp":1563457016,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

He represents the contractor process in action, by which he has done an exceptional amount of research to understand Decred, it's culture, values, and processes, and he has taken explicit actions and delivered for the project.\n\nCheckmate has made valuable contributions to growing awareness of Decred on social media, and his published work on Medium has been of high quality and has created a strong following.\n\nThe scope of his work is extremely complimentary to the existing approved work in marketing, events and research, and the assets will be repurposable. Additionally, his research will make a strong case in a way that has not been presented to this point. This will help increase our reach and grow our community more quickly.\n\nI'm glad to have Checkmate, and I'm optimistic the community also supports his efforts.","signature":"e121776a17284f276c061ad616b26ec8accdead513e8a3c4bc761845e78e623717114a3997f983ea73195dc5fcb3d44c21bf23d337c6d4ca3c5bda3dae59570d","publickey":"2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","commentid":"2","receipt":"6ed0e8ded42c6e88718dc27b9c95845d9f3cc190f08f03250d920913a22bf407932317b809cb64c8a83d74d2d258b6763b7f707ce4604c76e160cc179186a10d","timestamp":1563459783,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
