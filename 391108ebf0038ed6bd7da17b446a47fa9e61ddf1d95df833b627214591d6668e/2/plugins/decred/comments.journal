The content has been high quality and largely evergreen and I believe Eduardo has the right character, curiosity and demeanour to represent the project in this endeavour. Price is extremely reasonable (I almost say too reasonable) and the additional micro snippets are perfect for sharing online in social channels. It is also a clever way to get eyes on the project and its contributors. Project updates are important as a method for informing stakeholders about new releases and hearing from the brains behind it.\n\nI would like to ask Eduardo, what is your plan, strategy around the types of guests to be featured on DiD? Who do you want to have on the pod and do you have ideas around what categories of topics, shows and guests you might be seeking out?\n\nProposal has my support in spades.","signature":"6da1d66a5e1933c6f6075138d59cf82b5b125f8ef9624451023ab4fb6937a0ec5becdddde13b85a8906a99b591d3463796d452f7e0bffb248f798009caf9b401","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"1","receipt":"1144bbef93711c8a7ced268d37d2b7df23b3fea066f21c7e7cd20e418150f70b4df3aa545bf0473e805f427297d4ead04271cd87386203f1c0c035801f672a00","timestamp":1609986184,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The type of guests matters a lot. \n\nI really like the idea of bite sized video content because of their shareability. In my experience, Eduardo is a genuinely curious person who wants to help grow the Decred community. I can vouch for the fact that when I've shared ideas with him, he is welcoming and is open to iterations. \n\nA couple of items of feedback: You don't necessarily need to pre-determine episode length to be 1:15 - 1:45 ahead of time. Aim for a rough length (e.g. an hour) and be nimble with each episode based on the topics/guests. I also like the concept of speaking to crypto/investing as a broader topic, so that this can help us break out of the echo chamber. \n\nSupportive. Good luck.","signature":"28eb8834ef7f35681c9dd32c5d67fd4ba2c7abc7260d08deedce150b8db31431b50b973b7b15dcb8659399b65e5278b0c114e5189ab404afdae28ef31dc37206","publickey":"7bf956c858f4e123edba7c87b37bf819200c0588abc1ac00d5f8e0f0732bd3e4","commentid":"2","receipt":"b8a6e3911216edb51fcaac26ff4136d237c3111cc6629ac7a4148e02921782a7c65d22e339d9251a8263605415ade0f0907d619d582e15d64d16457e5a3fd70c","timestamp":1609991922,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You have been, no exaggeration, my strongest source of encouragement from the beginning; I am forever grateful. \n\nYes, allow me to elaborate on my hopeful guests, potential topics, strategy, etc. \n\nMr. Black managed to obtain an all-star list of guests. I plan to maintain the same level of quality. The last 27 episodes of DiD consisted of some of the most notable members of the Decred community. Still, there are many more notable voices that we have not heard from, and more emerging every day. \n\nI break down the guest types into 5 categories: developers, on-chain/fundamental analysts, institutional investors, community members, non-community members. I will have guests from each of these categories and my conversation topics will be appropriate for the guest. \n\nSome examples of individuals I would like to invite who have not been on before are Brandon Buchanan, Jimmy Song, Juarez Neto, Elian Huesca, Caitlin Long, Mike Novogratz, Raol Paul, Michael2xl, Pavel Svitek, Francov99.\n\nExamples of individuals I would like to re-invite (if it makes sense) include Check, JYK, Ammar, Permabull Nino, Chris Berniske. \n\nTruthfully, my goal is to repeat few to no guests. Unless a development occurs that necessitates such. \n\nI will remain open to guest suggestions and self-invitations. But I will not allow extremely random people on, as I have done on Staked. \n\nThe topics to be discussed will remain individualized to the specific guest.  Obviously, my questions to Elian would be different than my questions to Brandon. Some ideas I have already considered for show topics are investment thesis, running a full node, DCRDEX, privacy and the State, interoperability, DCR in Asia, Mobile Wallets (looking at you @beansgum).\n\nOne thing worth mentioning at this point is that Check and Nino have volunteered to informally assist in preparing questions for guests. Once I have I guest scheduled, I will run my questions by these gentlemen and solicit feedback and suggestions. Furthermore, because the interviews will be live-streamed, community members will have the opportunity to ask questions in real-time. \n\nMy main strategy for guest acquisition is \"cold call.\" This is a brute force strategy that requires persistence and tactfulness. Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, friendly introductions, etc. These will be my main sources of guest acquisition. Admittedly, this will be one of the most difficult parts of the job. But I am up for the task!","signature":"cacf43f2e3f642322d08d5f728ab20b6b39c2386c04eb72e105f7c27fd022209c788fec8541c10a4621f583f38a775f7eb102d865643b14c20ef670e4e1fce0b","publickey":"c271daeb6a3e4b94720efe4c3a924e4bf9cf08fa160263453881eba07de542ce","commentid":"3","receipt":"8245a02d23d03c5407da48457539b5822a0d31a528a4dbb4ed96f6a4467c4f402e94a399140628ec244ae1a1893f08afff8deefa17a3f9163020e64b02f3de04","timestamp":1610033760,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I would like to re-emphasize that I am extremely open to feedback and criticisms (one of my strengths). \n\nThe guests do matter a lot. DiD has maintained a high-quality of guests. I will not allow that to diminish if my proposal passes. Truthfully, the guest I aspire to have on will first be run by a group of trusted advisors who have a better feel for the community than myself. \n\nI agree. A predetermined length is not great, and I will remain flexible.  \n\nI also like the idea of speaking to crypto/investing as a broader topic. Initially, I thought DiD would not be an appropriate place to do so. Upon further thought, I think it would really depend on the guest. For example, If I could really get Raoul Pal on, it would be silly not to talk about investing as a broader topic. \n\nI would like to emphasize here my strategy for guest acquisition. Leverage the work and quality of Mister Black to attract continued high-quality guests. \n\nThank you Ammar for your confidence in me.","signature":"f4e5c542f9d374714eda21f548904529d0f37b76d021238b72cab5001dcd2dca1b613cfed01a90760fc1930fea02a89bf49cda3a802ad7c299e3bfa1c2bb9204","publickey":"c271daeb6a3e4b94720efe4c3a924e4bf9cf08fa160263453881eba07de542ce","commentid":"4","receipt":"680ac7b8dce63010d34600c459d3882fa75dea34157bfb66503e2a3b65ac3d64149f21e87cb6fa15b48680d342df6c7c87d74f3cc6fe92b2b1ff630a2d285c02","timestamp":1610034384,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
