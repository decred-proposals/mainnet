The content has been high quality and largely evergreen and I believe Eduardo has the right character, curiosity and demeanour to represent the project in this endeavour. Price is extremely reasonable (I almost say too reasonable) and the additional micro snippets are perfect for sharing online in social channels. It is also a clever way to get eyes on the project and its contributors. Project updates are important as a method for informing stakeholders about new releases and hearing from the brains behind it.\n\nI would like to ask Eduardo, what is your plan, strategy around the types of guests to be featured on DiD? Who do you want to have on the pod and do you have ideas around what categories of topics, shows and guests you might be seeking out?\n\nProposal has my support in spades.","signature":"6da1d66a5e1933c6f6075138d59cf82b5b125f8ef9624451023ab4fb6937a0ec5becdddde13b85a8906a99b591d3463796d452f7e0bffb248f798009caf9b401","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"1","receipt":"1144bbef93711c8a7ced268d37d2b7df23b3fea066f21c7e7cd20e418150f70b4df3aa545bf0473e805f427297d4ead04271cd87386203f1c0c035801f672a00","timestamp":1609986184,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The type of guests matters a lot. \n\nI really like the idea of bite sized video content because of their shareability. In my experience, Eduardo is a genuinely curious person who wants to help grow the Decred community. I can vouch for the fact that when I've shared ideas with him, he is welcoming and is open to iterations. \n\nA couple of items of feedback: You don't necessarily need to pre-determine episode length to be 1:15 - 1:45 ahead of time. Aim for a rough length (e.g. an hour) and be nimble with each episode based on the topics/guests. I also like the concept of speaking to crypto/investing as a broader topic, so that this can help us break out of the echo chamber. \n\nSupportive.

You have been, no exaggeration, my strongest source of encouragement from the beginning; I am forever grateful. \n\nYes, allow me to elaborate on my hopeful guests, potential topics, strategy, etc. \n\nMr. Black managed to obtain an all-star list of guests. I plan to maintain the same level of quality. The last 27 episodes of DiD consisted of some of the most notable members of the Decred community. Still, there are many more notable voices that we have not heard from, and more emerging every day. \n\nI break down the guest types into 5 categories: developers, on-chain/fundamental analysts, institutional investors, community members, non-community members. I will have guests from each of these categories and my conversation topics will be appropriate for the guest. \n\nSome examples of individuals I would like to invite who have not been on before are Brandon Buchanan, Jimmy Song, Juarez Neto, Elian Huesca, Caitlin Long, Mike Novogratz, Raol Paul, Michael2xl, Pavel Svitek, Francov99.\n\nExamples of individuals I would like to re-invite (if it makes sense) include Check, JYK, Ammar, Permabull Nino, Chris Berniske. \n\nTruthfully, my goal is to repeat few to no guests. Unless a development occurs that necessitates such. \n\nI will remain open to guest suggestions and self-invitations. But I will not allow extremely random people on, as I have done on Staked. \n\nThe topics to be discussed will remain individualized to the specific guest.  Obviously, my questions to Elian would be different than my questions to Brandon. Some ideas I have already considered for show topics are investment thesis, running a full node, DCRDEX, privacy and the State, interoperability, DCR in Asia, Mobile Wallets (looking at you @beansgum).\n\nOne thing worth mentioning at this point is that Check and Nino have volunteered to informally assist in preparing questions for guests. Once I have I guest scheduled, I will run my questions by these gentlemen and solicit feedback and suggestions. Furthermore, because the interviews will be live-streamed, community members will have the opportunity to ask questions in real-time. \n\nMy main strategy for guest acquisition is \"cold call.\" This is a brute force strategy that requires persistence and tactfulness. Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, friendly introductions, etc. These will be my main sources of guest acquisition. Admittedly, this will be one of the most difficult parts of the job. But I am up for the task!","signature":"cacf43f2e3f642322d08d5f728ab20b6b39c2386c04eb72e105f7c27fd022209c788fec8541c10a4621f583f38a775f7eb102d865643b14c20ef670e4e1fce0b","publickey":"c271daeb6a3e4b94720efe4c3a924e4bf9cf08fa160263453881eba07de542ce","commentid":"3","receipt":"8245a02d23d03c5407da48457539b5822a0d31a528a4dbb4ed96f6a4467c4f402e94a399140628ec244ae1a1893f08afff8deefa17a3f9163020e64b02f3de04","timestamp":1610033760,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I would like to re-emphasize that I am extremely open to feedback and criticisms (one of my strengths). \n\nThe guests do matter a lot. DiD has maintained a high-quality of guests.

Truthfully, the guest I aspire to have on will first be run by a group of trusted advisors who have a better feel for the community than myself. \n\nI agree. A predetermined length is not great, and I will remain flexible.  \n\nI also like the idea of speaking to crypto/investing as a broader topic. Initially, I thought DiD would not be an appropriate place to do so. Upon further thought, I think it would really depend on the guest. For example, If I could really get Raoul Pal on, it would be silly not to talk about investing as a broader topic. \n\nI would like to emphasize here my strategy for guest acquisition.

I listen to staked podcast regularly. I've seen your skills grow from the moment you started.  I think it is important to have new content regularly to keep DCR addicts alive. So as a stakeholder I'm more than happy to support a proposal to create this type of content.\nHowever I have some doubts about the format you choose to use in the proposal. I think there is a big gap between your personal style in staked podcast and the Decred in depth format. I'm not sure if you will be able to bridge that. The staked podcast is not enough 'evidence' of that. How do you look at the difference in format between Staked and DID. \nFrom an investors perspective the risks are to big. I would like to see a pilot with you doing a decred in depth style video. Or I would suggest you ask for a budget for a small amount of video's first, maybe 5-8.","signature":"7d8deab7de10f303598d90da0e1bf576f18a0f5a81fac09239816954749b6b777b906fbc601406ff26dba552d8cc01fcb77d2ca3555aad3debc76fbb5688c708","publickey":"ef6b167dc5c3683f440cd6be1901338c8cd905e12979088b9da780d9a97a66d5","commentid":"5","receipt":"084f662219bb60fc85fd01290be678960e5c7e3237f5a8bccca80a00918b8510360c74d27b07aa35acf4eaf065cd2e2e77d4876c565ab4cbcdc80d364f213805","timestamp":1610100010,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Professionalism\n2. Questions\n\nDuring Staked Podcast I often show a lot of my personality. I have my son with me, I curse from time-to-time, etc. DiD is a much more professional setting and a representation of the Decred community at large and not just my own personality and style. As such, I would not involve my family in my work, nor would I use foul language, as I believe these are not reflections of the professionalism of Decred.\n\nIn regards to questions, Staked podcast is much less strict in terms of questions. At Staked, I try to keep things very conversational, almost as if I was grabbing a beer. Whereas, with DiD, I would treat the interviews more like a job interview.  I believe Mr. Black stuck to a strict line of questioning. If I were to become the host of DiD, I would maintain a high level of professionalism and keep my tangential conversations to a minimum. \n\nI hope this gets directly at what you are referring to. If not, can you be more specific in what kind of things occur on Staked that you would not want to see on DiD (I promise my feelings will not be hurt). \n\nThank you for your feedback and for listening to Staked.","signature":"9f56c8762071449bef6add3667f4e934f90ba3d774e683bbcc1607738bbca4279884e27925494aaf7597dbbb874854bc08288d33000a88b7981672cd5c50790a","publickey":"c271daeb6a3e4b94720efe4c3a924e4bf9cf08fa160263453881eba07de542ce","commentid":"6","receipt":"0faf3d24119582c86e5dd82190702c3e71226ea72a59dd5cbfcdf4f3dbe82f0984abfaf8c71f0e2e2f3c3d96d6a9d2163d5bd6f3daf9d1ad70ff11f9e5b91a06","timestamp":1610105583,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

None of these are directed at Eduardo specifically.  They only pertain to the topic in general.\n\n1. If we pay influencers, will that cause some people to dismiss their messages entirely just because they know that they are being paid for their promotion?\n\n2. I don't believe that there are any great metrics to judge the success of paid influencers.  Did the price change (up or down) due to influencer actions or was it market conditions or some percentage of both?  Follower counts might be some indication but I don't believe that those very reliable either.  If the metrics are not good then how far down the slippery slope of paying influencers do we go?  How many of them do we pay and how much do we pay them without good metrics to judge success?\n\n3. What if the actions or beliefs of a paid influencer start to deter certain people from Decred?  Maybe their political beliefs come to light or maybe they did something controversial.  The stakeholders don't have oversight into what goes into a video.  If the stakeholders have already agreed to pay for video content production then do we continue to pay since they are technically still holding up their end of the bargain by producing content?  Even future actions of a host after the proposal is completed could end up staining the Decred project.   These things can happen with an unpaid influencer as well but in that case it's much easier to distance them from Decred's ideology.","signature":"152a2b9f4f06c3b4f1f3ccb6f97eead857d9fabbd0cb85e80e568d0e064bed0df8d67070d2ed3b8e769b289eb812a6c2e23c52227bf60c2e2f732c4bfc90fc09","publickey":"ce0dd858e52efcd88ba7e49dbd88d846d642c7b0b261a325ae327dc6b5ff6ccc","commentid":"14","receipt":"fe9f6cbe17181bef62ed30620e304489e38180970b0958cb1ada8850fccf6f346fe1297ec1e0919d067a7cfe06bd453c61c283ba620790ac0aaf6320fc290205","timestamp":1610641139,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If you recall, Mr Black set the precedent of bringing on guests familiar with Decred, none of whom are  paid to do so, who provide insight to stakeholders. Mr Black (and Eduardo if passed) engage the guest, and plan the podcast, prepare questions and produce the recording. They are not what I would classify as influencers but are instead **facilitators of a discussion**. They allow the guest the airtime and just direct and steer the conversation. I believe this is very appropriate to pay for by the treasury for the following reasons:\n\n1. Decred governance relies on quality and distilled information. DiD is invaluable as a source of fact coming from people close to the source.\n\n2.  Decred tech is complex and creators are smart. If I want to understand what the value proposition of the DEX for example, I can listen to chappjc and buck54321 talk it through on DiD. 45mins, straight from the source, full details as it happened. I would almost be of the volition that every consensus change needs an associated DiD podcast discussion to provide stakeholders with the insight they need to make a decision.\n\n3. A second order effect is the community can share those insights as marketing material. This is exactly equivalent to the Decred Journal which achieves the same outcome, just monthly, broard and written update format, DiD is specific guest and topic focus + audio format.","signature":"6e4962c32cc59e4139797ace64c55cd51e68b755257aa0338f97d20d2b3f0f6dc194ae1b93437bf443ac5e9107707fca349f296323cf96e7bd3d616f607abd00","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"15","receipt":"6b1467f18b25e9b9916fa79659ed5a4414fa1c949b5d7ab6370c8edade3472d995f6eada0da4afbdf073e03dfab9df5ca03c155e71489acf6d45de53bf777a08","timestamp":1610684625,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Curious if this proposal being approved would lead to a higher production value? I often find the audio quality of the Staked podcast to be lacking...which I'd expect for a project with no budget. Guests and host are often at different volumes, voices are not EQd, tends to sound like headphone or computer mics being used.
