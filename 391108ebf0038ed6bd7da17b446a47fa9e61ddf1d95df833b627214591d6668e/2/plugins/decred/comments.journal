The content has been high quality and largely evergreen and I believe Eduardo has the right character, curiosity and demeanour to represent the project in this endeavour. Price is extremely reasonable (I almost say too reasonable) and the additional micro snippets are perfect for sharing online in social channels. It is also a clever way to get eyes on the project and its contributors. Project updates are important as a method for informing stakeholders about new releases and hearing from the brains behind it.\n\nI would like to ask Eduardo, what is your plan, strategy around the types of guests to be featured on DiD? Who do you want to have on the pod and do you have ideas around what categories of topics, shows and guests you might be seeking out?\n\nProposal has my support in spades.","signature":"6da1d66a5e1933c6f6075138d59cf82b5b125f8ef9624451023ab4fb6937a0ec5becdddde13b85a8906a99b591d3463796d452f7e0bffb248f798009caf9b401","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"1","receipt":"1144bbef93711c8a7ced268d37d2b7df23b3fea066f21c7e7cd20e418150f70b4df3aa545bf0473e805f427297d4ead04271cd87386203f1c0c035801f672a00","timestamp":1609986184,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
