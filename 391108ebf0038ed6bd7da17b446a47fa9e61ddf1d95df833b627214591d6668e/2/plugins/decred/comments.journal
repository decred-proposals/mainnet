The content has been high quality and largely evergreen and I believe Eduardo has the right character, curiosity and demeanour to represent the project in this endeavour. Price is extremely reasonable (I almost say too reasonable) and the additional micro snippets are perfect for sharing online in social channels. It is also a clever way to get eyes on the project and its contributors. Project updates are important as a method for informing stakeholders about new releases and hearing from the brains behind it.\n\nI would like to ask Eduardo, what is your plan, strategy around the types of guests to be featured on DiD? Who do you want to have on the pod and do you have ideas around what categories of topics, shows and guests you might be seeking out?\n\nProposal has my support in spades.","signature":"6da1d66a5e1933c6f6075138d59cf82b5b125f8ef9624451023ab4fb6937a0ec5becdddde13b85a8906a99b591d3463796d452f7e0bffb248f798009caf9b401","publickey":"417321c06dccb7a4567d35975a8bb2e5849f1fd7d14b1d827ed6afc7f1c7646a","commentid":"1","receipt":"1144bbef93711c8a7ced268d37d2b7df23b3fea066f21c7e7cd20e418150f70b4df3aa545bf0473e805f427297d4ead04271cd87386203f1c0c035801f672a00","timestamp":1609986184,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

The type of guests matters a lot. \n\nI really like the idea of bite sized video content because of their shareability. In my experience, Eduardo is a genuinely curious person who wants to help grow the Decred community. I can vouch for the fact that when I've shared ideas with him, he is welcoming and is open to iterations. \n\nA couple of items of feedback: You don't necessarily need to pre-determine episode length to be 1:15 - 1:45 ahead of time. Aim for a rough length (e.g. an hour) and be nimble with each episode based on the topics/guests. I also like the concept of speaking to crypto/investing as a broader topic, so that this can help us break out of the echo chamber. \n\nSupportive. Good luck.","signature":"28eb8834ef7f35681c9dd32c5d67fd4ba2c7abc7260d08deedce150b8db31431b50b973b7b15dcb8659399b65e5278b0c114e5189ab404afdae28ef31dc37206","publickey":"7bf956c858f4e123edba7c87b37bf819200c0588abc1ac00d5f8e0f0732bd3e4","commentid":"2","receipt":"b8a6e3911216edb51fcaac26ff4136d237c3111cc6629ac7a4148e02921782a7c65d22e339d9251a8263605415ade0f0907d619d582e15d64d16457e5a3fd70c","timestamp":1609991922,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
