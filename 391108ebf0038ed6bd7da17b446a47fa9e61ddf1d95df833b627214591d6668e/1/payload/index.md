Decred in Depth (Live)

SUMMARY

I will live record, post edit, and create micro-content (videos less than 2:20) for twenty-four to thirty-six episodes of Decred in Depth (DiD) at the cost of $500.00 per episode for one year. 

BACKGROUND

My name is Eduardo Lima (@elima_iii). I am a law student and YouTube content creator. Some in the Decred community may know me as the host of Staked Podcast, a podcast centered around Decred and digital-asset investing. 
	
My philosophy on content creating centers around speed; done is better than perfect. The purpose of a piece of content is to educate, entertain, or escape. What's important is that your quality gets better with time. One should use these platforms to communicate with the brightest minds and those who share common interests. 
	
I started Staked Podcast on August 24, 2020, and in four months, I have recorded fifteen episodes. There are two episode formats at Staked: interview style and free form (me rambling). 

When I started Staked, I initially focused exclusively on Decred. As the show has progressed, Staked has evolved from being solely centered around Decred to being heavy Decred focus, with tangential conversations around the crypto space at large. From the beginning of Staked, I made clear my motivation for starting the podcast was to stack atoms. This same motive drives me to pursue this proposal now. Staked has operated off a donation model. Since inception, I have received 14.27 DCR (valued at $670.00 at the time of this writing).

My second motive for starting Staked was to force myself to stay up to date with Decred and challenge myself to dive deeper into the protocol. I wanted to challenge myself to grow in technical competence. There are three levels of crypto sophistication: custodian, Ledger, full-node operator. I knew there were many DCR holders who, like myself, were in the second category. I wanted to make content that entertained and educated this demographic specifically while pushing us all to become full-node operators. 

Staked has evolved over the past four months, and with the pivot alongside the encouragement of some in the community, I have decided I want to nominate myself to step in as host of DiD, as I believe Mr. Black is stepping down. 

WORK TO BE DONE

If this proposal passes, I will prepare, coordinate, and conduct two to three interviews a month (no free form). Each interview will last between 1:15 – 1:45 minutes in length. Each interview's date and time will be published to the community at least one week in advance. Each interview will be live-streamed to the Decred Youtube channel (and maybe Facebook and Twitch). The live recording would be downloaded and post-produced for the podcast. I will also create micro-content (videos under 2:20) for Twitter. Twitter does not allow videos longer than 2:20.

VALUE PROPOSITION

As we enter 2021 with more lockdowns on the horizon, the work from home trend will likely continue. Live stream interviews could serve as a fun community-building event that would help foster a robust group identity and community. Decred hodlers worldwide would tune in for regular online gatherings and be able to ask questions live. 

Those who cannot make it to the live stream could watch the playback or wait until the episode gets published on podcast platforms. 

The micro-content videos would display the best and most shareable 2:20 segments from each interview.

Aside from the content value, I believe this proposal, if it passes, continues the historied Decred narrative; anyone can show up, do some work for the community, and if the work is excellent and valuable, he/she can become a Decred Contractor. 

COSTS

Content creating contractors have, in the past, operated on a per hour basis. I propose working on a per-episode basis. This was the simplest way for me to make the economic calculation. It also created a very predictable treasury expenditure.

I propose a cost of $500.00 per episode. For those unfamiliar with industry pricing, $500.00 is less than half what the cheapest professional social-media firms charge for this kind of work.

The work that goes into creating one episode involves: cold contacting, follow-up, scheduling, pre-interview research/preparation, recording, post-editing, thumbnail, SEO optimization. Depending on the episode, this can take between 10-15 hours in total.

In other words, I am not trying to get rich off this. I am trying to make enough money to keep the lights on. 


PARTING THOUGHT

I know some in the community are philosophically opposed to spending treasury funds on "media." They deem media a priori, categorically unworthy of Treasury funds. 

I respond to these critics not with words but with a video. A video that drew me to Decred in the early days of my journey; one I am sure many of you have seen.

“What is Decred? An Introduction.” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAMp5V_gG1E) 

At 1:27, it says, "Decred is Engineers, Artists, Entrepreneurs."

I believe building the digital economy that is Decred allows and necessitates people of all skillsets participation in treasury expenditure. 

Thank you for your consideration. I am open to feedback and criticism.
