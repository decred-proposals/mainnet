The constitution doesn't have any language that constrains stakeholders, because it is secondary to the blockchain's consensus rules and can itself be amended by a stakeholder vote.\n\nIn my view there's strong social consensus that miners should not be able to block the start of a consensus rules vote by refusing to upgrade. The role of PoS voters in approving rewards for PoW miners gives them the power to force miners to upgrade (or stop receiving rewards) in this kind of scenario.","signature":"6652e97acd48acb1fe5acc2b19893d8c12ee37dbac545b1d83e584d85d72f8306929f1484d1a0fb29bca429b4eb276327b9ef3dc3bec65d69632b6580420d00d","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"d387ae2ab85656cce7e284f0f4d7c00e9d3cba5eef119c5248efd4596fed11f7d65bd1f4fac82bc9d1e4fbb83f1980aca22d840e59cd9b471857bee77173e10b","timestamp":1554515308,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
