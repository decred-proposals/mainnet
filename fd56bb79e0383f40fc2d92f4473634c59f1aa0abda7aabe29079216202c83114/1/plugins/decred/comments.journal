The constitution doesn't have any language that constrains stakeholders, because it is secondary to the blockchain's consensus rules and can itself be amended by a stakeholder vote.\n\nIn my view there's strong social consensus that miners should not be able to block the start of a consensus rules vote by refusing to upgrade. The role of PoS voters in approving rewards for PoW miners gives them the power to force miners to upgrade (or stop receiving rewards) in this kind of scenario.","signature":"6652e97acd48acb1fe5acc2b19893d8c12ee37dbac545b1d83e584d85d72f8306929f1484d1a0fb29bca429b4eb276327b9ef3dc3bec65d69632b6580420d00d","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"d387ae2ab85656cce7e284f0f4d7c00e9d3cba5eef119c5248efd4596fed11f7d65bd1f4fac82bc9d1e4fbb83f1980aca22d840e59cd9b471857bee77173e10b","timestamp":1554515308,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

My only concern is putting so many numeric parameters in the constitution (i.e. voting thresholds, periods, etc.). These values could change in the future, and having them in the constitution complicates things, since you'd need to vote on both changing consensus, then on changing the constitution to match consensus reality. Maybe I'm overthinking this, IDK.","signature":"a34cfc180afa7686b03e545a5e9b9b144b33a5e25542e7240d8962e0c4dc836a1184eeaaee0a1c0547d4621b64bd4d0b4538c8ce585d4e41cf62878a27a3ad0e","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"3","receipt":"14f258b6080734e628ad178b590b97372095134a6a7ef46fcce48b34eeadb5f669bd13357ecfe495b0d83a0f94b9a5ae018bf5cad9f505f5f14c11539c170e0a","timestamp":1554562322,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It had not occurred to me that a Politeia proposal would be required to update the constitution if some of the on-chain parameters are changed following a successful rule change proposal. \n\nPoliteia proposals have different requirements to rule change proposals, and determine the tickets which are eligible to vote through a snapshot of the ticket pool at a specific block height, as opposed to the rolling sortition of on chain voting. It is possible that a Politeia proposal to update the constitution might fail despite a successful on chain vote and the changes being activated.\n\nThe constitution says it is secondary to the consensus rules of the network should any conflict arise, so it may make more sense to just update it with the new number(s) should any of them be changed by an on chain vote.","signature":"4839a9cf860d33c422f5afba956de0fc4a68eda3a508dfd271a1d7798cdd43256267f74f8b1333a602169c8fc3ea1e73bbf924bc1e8a871b3bbbbc53ca0d0806","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"4","receipt":"7f8d211c9f41b31714e33d954f76e63c6b18e09e7efa9db2233ed302bdef21401ebe5218d2adc8e75a857617bd710605e3efdb507af66650ff03c34caee0cf00","timestamp":1554595175,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
