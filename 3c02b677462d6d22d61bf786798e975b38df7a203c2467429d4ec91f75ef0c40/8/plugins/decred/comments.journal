Since it's notoriously difficult to gauge whether or not something is a \"conversion\" for a cc project because you cannot tell who is buying Decred and for what reason, I think a focus on finding developers as a deliverable would be a positive change.  The BR developers working with the project have acted as a force multiplier both in the context of achieving development milestones and spreading awareness amongst the more-technical non-developer audience, so it makes sense to emulate this configuration.\n\nIt appears that you plan to pivot to producing several videos a month for the Latam market, which is a good idea.  Can you give some detail on how you plan to produce, edit and publish these videos?  I am asking about this because I think Exitus has been doing a good job creating and editing EN video content, so I think we should attempt to emulate this success.\n\nIt would be good to see the contractors listed in your proposal split out by their country of residence, so we can get a better idea of where the staff are located.","signature":"dd575632b54a44771c2600baa2b36dd03702c3ae1257259967e48769a5f3f5be0adc4c868add508760a085c9426e6402a8e03cb2aee1145aa0526c942717250c","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"2","receipt":"e74f643123aef458c3558072de30233da9d59c8e9745b4d8df5b287f5a1d1050caf930877f6cccef3ffe20beeb816fc7fdfbd214332ba8b8087aaab8d50ab207","timestamp":1589895712,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Regarding consumer adoption and the motives of people to use cryptocurrencies in Latam, there is still a long way to go and it really depends on the country you explore. \n\nFor example in Argentina people is looking into monetary alternatives to hedge from the Argentinian peso. However, in this realm, dollars in cash are the king. More tech savvy people are looking into Bitcoin as another monetary alternative for savings (70%) and international transfers (30%). The idea of having digital dollars through DeFi products is also gaining traction in the country. Particularly in the case of Decred, users may be looking into DCR as part of a diversified portfolio (supposing they did their own research). There are several projects that are working towards time-stamping  based solutions. It is important to take in consideration that Argentina is a developer power house in the region. \n\nIn Colombia one of the big drivers is trading and mining of cryptocurrencies. On the one hand the speculative use case of cryptocurrencies is a big driver of adoption. On the other, there is an interesting relation between Colombia and Venezuela in which Bitcoin that is mined in the Venezuelan side is sold with a discount on the Colombian side. There is usually a 10% discount in the Colombian Bitcoin market compared to the global market. \n\nVenezuela is one of the most advanced countries in terms of cryptocurrency awareness that I've got the chance to visit. Hyperinflation and the development of the Petro have increase the acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a monetary alternative. However, there is not the level of adoption that has been portrait to the rest of the cryptocurrency world. Moreover, as with the rest of the countries in Latam, dollars in cash are the king. \n\nIn the case of Mexico the main driver is speculative investment and the remittance market. On the one hand, there is easy access to buy/sell/exchange cryptocurrencies so there is high demand for investment assets. On the other hand, user experiences and interfaces are still lacking the practicality for the average user to use them for international money transfers. Nonetheless, there is a growing number of start-ups that are leveraging cryptocurrencies technology to build products for the remittance market. Here is an interesting study on consumer [adoption of cryptocurrencies](https://medium.com/@entiendebitcoin/update-new-findings-distributing-bitcoin-in-latin-america-16fbb2a5f3eb) in Mexico. \n\nWe see several use cases that are unfolding in the region:\n\n- People escaping traditional finance systems \n\n- Long term investments \n\n- Short term investments \n\n- Products or services on top of Decred protocol (example is OriginalMy, we are constantly showcasing the project tech stack for entrepreneurs to use it)\n\n- Privacy focus users, tech and finance savvy people \n\n- People looking into scientific knowledge\n\nIn the case of Decred's consumer adoption, there is still a long way for brand awareness and recognition, and infrastructure development for easy access to DCR. \n\nIf we take [monetary theory](https://twitter.com/MustStopMurad/status/1022169639386836992) into consideration there is still a long way to before we get into into a consumer adoption because this would suppose that we are beyond the SoV stage and into de MoE. I would argue that there is a high degree of awareness but a low level of adoption in the form of consumer payments. \n\nWe are looking forward to bring more details and insights into consumer adoption, there are challenges on how to measure this but this is definitely part of our goals. I think that as we see more rsolutions to buy/sell/exchange/pay with DCR there will be growing consumer adoption.

Latam market is a big bucket with many countries so the needs for crypto differ from country to country -as 3lian outlined-. Yet, the narrative boils down to a means to store wealth amidst crippling economies (turns out printing out pesos to pay dollar-based debt is terrible business) and to remittances. \n\nAs of why our spanish-speaking community uses Decred, I was curious too, primarily to see if the narrative of SoV has really clicked here, so I ran a small survey the first two weeks of April. This quick experiment resulted -sadly- in a small amount of data for it to be considered a representation of the group, so no inductive conclusions at all.  However, if I was to share an insight from that experiment it would be this one -but take it with a grain of salt-: of my respondents, just 30 percent have Decred and they consider themselves traders within the crypto ecosystem and the Decred ecosystem and they use Decredition/Dcrwallet to store it. That is as far \nas I can go.   \n\nAnd anecdotally -for what is worth- my conversations both in person and virtually all go to remittances as the #1 need here. For sure, there is an on-going exchange of currencies and crytocurrencies on a daily basis.

To my knowledge so far it was technical universities. I wonder how students of economics would react to the idea of fixed supply currencies.\n- overall the team is very active and has achieved a lot, it makes sense to keep building on that foundation\n\nQuestions:\n\n- How many people became Decred users over the past 6 months, based on your interactions with Latam/Spanish audience? Obviously it is a hard question, but there may be some indirect signals. For example, do you see a rise in personal trading or technical support in Spanish channels? Did any new merchants begin to accept DCR? Any new exchange integrations?\n- How many people attended Latam Decred events in total (approximately)?\n- Are Decred Journal translations funded from the Marketing 2019/2020 bugets or from the Latam Marketing budget? Asking because it is confusing that the [2020 one](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c830ea5afea45a0aabf4092d1bea51fb10b8bfa2d8474aac03224f0f94d3d1af) also includes DJ translations.\n- Can you please comment on this \"surplus due to positive exchange rate\"? Does it mean the $72K billing limit was respected, but more USD was actually acquired because at the time of conversion the rate was higher than the billing rate?\n- Can you give a general idea how contractor hours were allocated? The linked gist has nice breakdowns for many expenses but not for the hours, which take roughly half of the budget.\n- Why some flight items are so expensive (e.g. January)?\n- It is good to have Spanish content in the video format but the view counts look a bit sad. Do you think it is worth the effort?\n- What is the hardest thing about bringing Decred to people?","signature":"863fcd8d650e6c1e6b429404241c6ee4309dee9b23694a27dd877a1c696288e84c020d8d7479968980c95df92a3df7196770cd3644b9870ca4d781bd2560e604","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"21","receipt":"7dc232528ce3098916e6bb9e54645f328d0a413a8f70351294008ab3207d8576f5dba2dfd18a98ee2b6c9aacf23d862bdd9227640421554fe50375b2e7bf0503","timestamp":1591058253,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Taking into consideration a non representative sample of the Spanish speaking users, @adcade deducted that around 30% of our users have DCR, use Decrediton and consider themselves  cryptocurrency traders. If we take this information and the number of people reached during this past 6 months, we could argue (take it with a grain of salt) that around 343 people might be new DCR users. But again, this was not a representative sample in order to take conclusive data. From anecdotical experience, we have seen a steady grow of queries about DCR in social media. As per merchants, payment processors and exchange integrations, this proposal will reinforce efforts to accelerate adoption in this fronts through business development activities. \n\n-  After counting both IRL (420) and virtual events (722) there were a total of 1144 people directly reached by our efforts,  around 190 per month, 47 per week, 7 per day. \n\n- Mi mistake here, December, January, and February translations are funded with the Latam budget and March and April translations are budgeted from the Marketing  2020 proposal. \n\n- Exactly. Most DCR received for operations was exchanged during positive rate periods which resulted in the surplus of 10K. \n\n- Contractor hours are divided into the following content creation (40% of hours), business development (20%), PR (20%) and community management (20%). This is considering the month of April or May that only budgeted contractor hours and team activities. \n\n- Of course, there is a clarification missing in the flight expense of $4,969.15: this is for 4 returns flights Buenos Aires, Argentina to Guadalajara, Mexico and 1 return flight from La Paz, Bolivia to Guadalajara, Mexico. These 5 flights were bought for Talent Land 2020 which was postponed to April 2021 due to Covid-19, flights are now in stand by and waiting for new flying dates. As per the expense of $3,700.00, these flights are 1 return from Mexico City to Panama City ($458.54), 1 flight from Mexico City, Mexico \u003e Caracas, Venezuela \u003e Panama City, Panama \u003e Madrid, Spain \u003e Barcelona, Spain \u003e Mexico City, Mexico ($2397.79) and a last minute flight that was purchased on March 13th due to Covid-19 borders closing, this flights is from Panama City, Panama to Mexico City, Mexico ($841.71) and subsequently, flight from Panama to Spain was put in stand by. We are expectant to see how things unfold worldwide in terms of travelling in order to select dates for the mentioned disrupted flights. \n\n- Indeed, I'm not contempt with numbers on Youtube. There is an area of opportunity to leverage more video format content in Spanish. I think is important to continue these efforts and now focus more energy on its distribution. I agree that numbers need to go up on this area. \n\n- Probably the hardest part of bringing Decred to people is the complexity and nuances of the project, people take a while to completely grasp the implications of having governance mechanisms and a treasury for development. More and more people as about fiat on ramps, at the moment is hard to bring DCR to people in 10 countries as there are not yet fiat on ramps. I think the bigger the Spanish community the more attention will come from exchanges. Furthermore, it is challenging to do organic marketing and have an exponential reach, this is the trade-off between convenience and privacy. \n\nPlease let me know if there is any other query. \n\nThanks again. Best!

People are comfortable and despite presenting innovative solutions, they still doubt the effort they have to make compared to traditional systems. Much of our job is to reduce that work by simple explanations or creating documentations and content simplifying the complexity of this system.","signature":"d6eaaa3dc3a37739961c631e471e9844efbff7f85210747e50871ff170a24e42b9aa678033f8d26aa5c638b2866411bfbb52d4e2172f90ad353a965badd8d00d","publickey":"dfabf889db106edd082571cbb2f3ecff418aebd9d836f7caf97c9ced89717422","commentid":"23","receipt":"b662a497e93fd54230b18f816b82b9fc21db8e91879c987ee0ba4ea9b7610bc146f52029521087ec4d6ae60fe9c29b620fea9f738d224ff9ec964b090c55d808","timestamp":1591202597,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
