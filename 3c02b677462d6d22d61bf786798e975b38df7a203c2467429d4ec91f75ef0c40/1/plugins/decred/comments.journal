I like the plans to focus on developer recruitment and raising awareness in academia in particular.\n\n","signature":"15421afea818b57d8d86846b2a7dca35204c6b06c80823f7cfbd02a86e33b630ca616546936a4c722d8d8807c76a7b38fee118e0e702b08326e454d4402cdb07","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"c1ce42f968251ca18f81d2bb52fa7afbabe4b6d9531cea0b0e98be43a82fa28d567d4e10028f18df8190622be914ce7c9899ff24e93517abdb5d8717f2bbfb0a","timestamp":1589888917,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Since it's notoriously difficult to gauge whether or not something is a \"conversion\" for a cc project because you cannot tell who is buying Decred and for what reason, I think a focus on finding developers as a deliverable would be a positive change.  The BR developers working with the project have acted as a force multiplier both in the context of achieving development milestones and spreading awareness amongst the more-technical non-developer audience, so it makes sense to emulate this configuration.\n\nIt appears that you plan to pivot to producing several videos a month for the Latam market, which is a good idea.  Can you give some detail on how you plan to produce, edit and publish these videos?  I am asking about this because I think Exitus has been doing a good job creating and editing EN video content, so I think we should attempt to emulate this success.\n\nIt would be good to see the contractors listed in your proposal split out by their country of residence, so we can get a better idea of where the staff are located.","signature":"dd575632b54a44771c2600baa2b36dd03702c3ae1257259967e48769a5f3f5be0adc4c868add508760a085c9426e6402a8e03cb2aee1145aa0526c942717250c","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"2","receipt":"e74f643123aef458c3558072de30233da9d59c8e9745b4d8df5b287f5a1d1050caf930877f6cccef3ffe20beeb816fc7fdfbd214332ba8b8087aaab8d50ab207","timestamp":1589895712,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We tried to make it as comprehensive as possible, so many things happened in 6 months. Yes, Covid-19 was unexpected and forced us to change the strategy, after a couple of months working full virtual I see advantages (cheaper, exponential reach, appealing content) and disadvantages (impersonal, colder debates, lack of swag) over IRL events, we are all digital natives at Decred so it was a smooth shifting. \n\nBest!\n\n","signature":"27d997c5c8574fa81033bc2214ba7653d1887e61fa9ee76aae4fc619fe8a20b12427021f25a8a81a3bc526af1da337b56d399a9bd4fbdf2b11a50098c1cb1208","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"4","receipt":"5945cee6c0ea76572453f642678040e49a7c985ee4c35d25a70247f1167dd1aa6b7ca15343f09e45a0f2c7212a356f768d039ed6bbc89e380e9950e88204ab02","timestamp":1589902458,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Agree that there has to be more efforts towards developer communities in Latam. We are aiming at creating more content dedicated to devs like the last webinar on [\"How to fund open source software?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVtOBAAerXk\u0026t=5s) co-hosted by the hacking community in Peru. We receive great feedback from them and we are aiming at repeating this in other devs communities in Latam and Spain.\n\nRegarding video production, we have iterated on several locations and formats for video content on [Decred en Espa√±ol Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCprOo4gR1vsjJTAzv8BMBQ/videos), our first location was a [studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOMbJQMOcWA), then we changed to [another studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxIo17L2ipY), after Covid-19 we professionalised our software with [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) which allow us to livestream in different social media accounts and to increase significantly the quality of the [video production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P_Uuiq1CUQ). The work flow, in the Decred Journal recap for example,  goes from DJ  \u003e  scripting \u003e filming \u003e editing \u003e publishing. The production funnel is something that is constantly in iteration.\n\nI'll update the team section to reflect how are we distributed.\n\nBest!\n\n","signature":"1c322416e01c87f96e9871a898965fe69b3e6aabc38b5f2b02dcf521f57712e5368ea476279ae322a7659ed3c04da3becb417d275cb27d229e79ca44cdf77209","publickey":"f9da0bd73ab97e9e4b3097c71cfbac5273466eeac44520872fc65ae5c24274b0","commentid":"5","receipt":"3a3321165cd6f22edd325afb8f54df1d1635642816bc8f7e87675fcf04c0152d3a5854a3205ced50e9481c6b0317d19766ced1b4b69e1ca6d46aace8ce499701","timestamp":1589905159,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
