I like the plans to focus on developer recruitment and raising awareness in academia in particular.\n\n","signature":"15421afea818b57d8d86846b2a7dca35204c6b06c80823f7cfbd02a86e33b630ca616546936a4c722d8d8807c76a7b38fee118e0e702b08326e454d4402cdb07","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"c1ce42f968251ca18f81d2bb52fa7afbabe4b6d9531cea0b0e98be43a82fa28d567d4e10028f18df8190622be914ce7c9899ff24e93517abdb5d8717f2bbfb0a","timestamp":1589888917,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Since it's notoriously difficult to gauge whether or not something is a \"conversion\" for a cc project because you cannot tell who is buying Decred and for what reason, I think a focus on finding developers as a deliverable would be a positive change.  The BR developers working with the project have acted as a force multiplier both in the context of achieving development milestones and spreading awareness amongst the more-technical non-developer audience, so it makes sense to emulate this configuration.\n\nIt appears that you plan to pivot to producing several videos a month for the Latam market, which is a good idea.  Can you give some detail on how you plan to produce, edit and publish these videos?  I am asking about this because I think Exitus has been doing a good job creating and editing EN video content, so I think we should attempt to emulate this success.\n\nIt would be good to see the contractors listed in your proposal split out by their country of residence, so we can get a better idea of where the staff are located.","signature":"dd575632b54a44771c2600baa2b36dd03702c3ae1257259967e48769a5f3f5be0adc4c868add508760a085c9426e6402a8e03cb2aee1145aa0526c942717250c","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"2","receipt":"e74f643123aef458c3558072de30233da9d59c8e9745b4d8df5b287f5a1d1050caf930877f6cccef3ffe20beeb816fc7fdfbd214332ba8b8087aaab8d50ab207","timestamp":1589895712,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
