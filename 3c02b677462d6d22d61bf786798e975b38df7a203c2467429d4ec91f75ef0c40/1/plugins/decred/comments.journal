I like the plans to focus on developer recruitment and raising awareness in academia in particular.\n\n","signature":"15421afea818b57d8d86846b2a7dca35204c6b06c80823f7cfbd02a86e33b630ca616546936a4c722d8d8807c76a7b38fee118e0e702b08326e454d4402cdb07","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"c1ce42f968251ca18f81d2bb52fa7afbabe4b6d9531cea0b0e98be43a82fa28d567d4e10028f18df8190622be914ce7c9899ff24e93517abdb5d8717f2bbfb0a","timestamp":1589888917,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
