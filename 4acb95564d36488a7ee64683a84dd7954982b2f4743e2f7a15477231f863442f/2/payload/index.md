Decred Stickers: Enlarge Decred community

**What**

This proposal would fund Decred Stickers Pack (and related features) for Enlarging Decred community

**Why**

In our overwhelmed world is very important that as many people as possible know about the blockchain and Decred ecosystem.
Our team plans to do it in a non-standard way. We want to make and design a set of stickers for the Decred blockchain.
After the design, we will create a one-page website where anyone can download and use a set of Decred stickers for their needs for free, example send it in telegram chats or other messengers, print and use as paper stickers, stick on laptops or other places.

There will also be a one-page document explaining what Decred is, so, you can use this to give someone else some stickers and show them what Decred is and does with said document. The document is on Decred technology and goals and will not contain financial or investment advice. The information is freely attainable online and the document will not contain any privileged or "special info."

**How**

The ecosystem will receive:

- Stickers pack (15 stickers) with Decred symbolics ready for print or web use
- Stickers pack (15 stickers) ready to use in Telegram (https://telegram.org/blog/discover-stickers-and-more)
- One-page document with explanation what Decred is
- Web-site where you can download all this for free

One designer and one frontend developer will be working on this project. 

- Stickers Design - 25 hours * $30 per hour = $750
- Design and Markup for web-site - 15 hours * $30 per hour = $450
- Design for one-page document - 5 hours * $20 per hour = $100
- Implement stickers in Telegram - 5 hours * $20 per hour = $100

Total: $1 400
