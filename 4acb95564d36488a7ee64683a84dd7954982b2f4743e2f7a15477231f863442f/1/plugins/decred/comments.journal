As jz pointed out, we already have a sticker pack on Matrix and Telegram that features 'Stakey' - Decred's mascot. It doesn't get too much use (if any) because people are normally busy actually discussing real Decred related things.\n2. You should provide some sort of mock-up to display what sort of Stickers you are trying to create. Art is subjective, people don't want to gamble on what the end result will be.\n3. I think the asking price of $1400 for 15 Stickers is excessive.\n\nWith that said: Thanks for using Politeia and good luck with your proposal.","signature":"28522880009d7ced11316e5311022e5bacaea4da46cfe44ce393edfa8abe61d213a2273b74532a65b93aed72f35b8db07df511cda263be4d24c980c78c26dd00","publickey":"988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458","commentid":"4","receipt":"4a87f6d792a1e69d7372474cd6d527fae16ad43851259b8b1c1719738dad4234704bb2773e3b972ca4a18e9ed725894f597a5263e04a201379b158899f4b9b05","timestamp":1578463521,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
