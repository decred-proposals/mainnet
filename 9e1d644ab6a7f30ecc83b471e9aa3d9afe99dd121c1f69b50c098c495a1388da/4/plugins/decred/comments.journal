I've requested a preview from “Ammar” instead of mere bullet points, which is beyond reasonable given the nature of the proposal — $16,000 USD for an unwritten book by a no name author with an average at best portfolio — but not only did the author fail to give this Treasury a preview of his work, he also took offense to the very suggestion.\n\n\u003e It's not like you have to pay money for this, we got $36 million in a treasury. Yet it seems like the community is way too conservative with it.\n\nThis Treasury isn’t a slush fund for “The Friends of Decred”.\n\n\u003e The last thing we need is this coin to lose attention, and have the treasury decline in value because the coin is losing attention.\n\nCoins are like memes. Weak ones quickly lose our attention due to a lack of entertainment value. Given the author of this proposal has failed to demonstrate the ability to engage an audience through written text — and failed to engage meaningfully on Politeia — my most reasonable guess is there will be very limited entertainment value purchased here at a cost of $16,000 USD.\n\nIn addition, paying this person $16,000 USD will further the self-destructive expectation that doing free \"marketing\" for Decred is a sure path to getting paid for it, regardless of quality or results.\n\nThis incentivizes future contributions of similarly limited value, and it risks turning away quality, talented people who might've otherwise become interested in Decred organically.","signature":"745b7138887dffc890bb0c276efa28a9d0a96078b427627c75a56c1bd557a2bb77ed2766dbc5f603e61332b23d8cb8e696ef8da66fc662bb3d134c1250ef1509","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"15","receipt":"879059c54099c6a41578b2ed8b6a185ae6593e3890114b9b4d6bb39f95ff7fe5bde08d6f5d2cd08a6d1a3eedcd5333f7fafcd7f4461027fb5466d3133d851b0a","timestamp":1611373051,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

One of whom happened to be an extremely prolific copywriter. This particular individual did all the usual things to perfection. But a standout feature of his persona — what made his presence unmistakeably golden — was his propensity to go above and beyond expectations every single time in all of his written communications. As if to say “Look, I know this material cold, and I’m playing with it because I feel like it”.\n\nThe way you paired infographics with the written word in this article reminds me of that person to some extent. I think it's fair to say you demonstratively possess a deep, confident connection with the subject material.\n\nYour shtick is competing in an overcrowded space. I worry about the optics of paying for marketing, particularly when a cursory look at the top 10 coins reveals no obvious paid marketing efforts being involved in valuation. But it's highly important for Decred to maintain a pulse, so as to invite newcomers. And as concerned as I am with the optics of paying for marketing, I'm interested to see what happens when sufficiently talented individuals are paid to create waves on a consistent basis.\n\nOn balance, given the price asked, I think it's a no brainer to have you on retainer for many months. I'm now in support of this proposal. And I'd encourage others on the fence to withhold judgment before taking a look at this new article.","signature":"4cfd7835fa82e8612d105a4979d4b6063ac43f4665bd4262bf3b8d89d3000f5f35a1182cbdee7d962ef797a8e949d4c4c6885f8946afe58435dcca1ece722505","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"17","receipt":"e03edcdbdf4e5f0103dc530e9b059c84d194c707ec1c639cf94817ecb449f1dc76d9502d552f9d49bcbf00ef29c5dde64b28715b0542a9c8bdc7858bba813b01","timestamp":1611442991,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
