I've requested a preview from “Ammar” instead of mere bullet points, which is beyond reasonable given the nature of the proposal — $16,000 USD for an unwritten book by a no name author with an average at best portfolio — but not only did the author fail to give this Treasury a preview of his work, he also took offense to the very suggestion.\n\n\u003e It's not like you have to pay money for this, we got $36 million in a treasury. Yet it seems like the community is way too conservative with it.\n\nThis Treasury isn’t a slush fund for “The Friends of Decred”.\n\n\u003e The last thing we need is this coin to lose attention, and have the treasury decline in value because the coin is losing attention.\n\nCoins are like memes. Weak ones quickly lose our attention due to a lack of entertainment value. Given the author of this proposal has failed to demonstrate the ability to engage an audience through written text — and failed to engage meaningfully on Politeia — my most reasonable guess is there will be very limited entertainment value purchased here at a cost of $16,000 USD.\n\nIn addition, paying this person $16,000 USD will further the self-destructive expectation that doing free \"marketing\" for Decred is a sure path to getting paid for it, regardless of quality or results.\n\nThis incentivizes future contributions of similarly limited value, and it risks turning away quality, talented people who might've otherwise become interested in Decred organically.","signature":"745b7138887dffc890bb0c276efa28a9d0a96078b427627c75a56c1bd557a2bb77ed2766dbc5f603e61332b23d8cb8e696ef8da66fc662bb3d134c1250ef1509","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"15","receipt":"879059c54099c6a41578b2ed8b6a185ae6593e3890114b9b4d6bb39f95ff7fe5bde08d6f5d2cd08a6d1a3eedcd5333f7fafcd7f4461027fb5466d3133d851b0a","timestamp":1611373051,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

One of whom happened to be an extremely prolific copywriter. This particular individual did all the usual things to perfection. But a standout feature of his persona — what made his presence unmistakeably golden — was his propensity to go above and beyond expectations every single time in all of his written communications. As if to say “Look, I know this material cold, and I’m playing with it because I feel like it”.\n\nThe way you paired infographics with the written word in this article reminds me of that person to some extent. I think it's fair to say you demonstratively possess a deep, confident connection with the subject material.\n\nYour shtick is competing in an overcrowded space. I worry about the optics of paying for marketing, particularly when a cursory look at the top 10 coins reveals no obvious paid marketing efforts being involved in valuation. But it's highly important for Decred to maintain a pulse, so as to invite newcomers. And as concerned as I am with the optics of paying for marketing, I'm interested to see what happens when sufficiently talented individuals are paid to create waves on a consistent basis.\n\nOn balance, given the price asked, I think it's a no brainer to have you on retainer for many months. I'm now in support of this proposal. And I'd encourage others on the fence to withhold judgment before taking a look at this new article.","signature":"4cfd7835fa82e8612d105a4979d4b6063ac43f4665bd4262bf3b8d89d3000f5f35a1182cbdee7d962ef797a8e949d4c4c6885f8946afe58435dcca1ece722505","publickey":"7fface550c654dc2b3a33ad3ed2faad8d08bd3082a4d07586ebde715af5ef945","commentid":"17","receipt":"e03edcdbdf4e5f0103dc530e9b059c84d194c707ec1c639cf94817ecb449f1dc76d9502d552f9d49bcbf00ef29c5dde64b28715b0542a9c8bdc7858bba813b01","timestamp":1611442991,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We need to tell them that taking back our sovereignty is now more real than ever. It requires to stop powering corrupted \"circuits\" with our time and energy, and start powering more fair ones. It is unpopular, it is hard, it requires to rebuild a good chunk of our lives, but I believe there are a lot of people who are ready that we are not in contact with yet. And the good news is that it can be done gradually without risky \"all-ins\" (e.g. move 3% of your wealth to crypto and 5% of your paid time to crypto jobs).\n\n\u003e Decred can extend this narrative with a DAO narrative\n\nIn my head all narratives are derived from Decred's killer feature: \"Decred-grade [sovereignty](https://github.com/decredcommunity/wiki/blob/master/wiki/misconceptions.md#coin-holders-cannot-make-good-decisions)\", or whatever this can be reworded as to help people \"get\" it.\n\n\u003e not every page will be about $DCR. This is required in order to be intellectually honest\n\nI like it, and also I suggest to not avoid Decred's unsolved weak spots. We need to tell what it can and cannot do to facilitate maximally informed choices.\n\n\u003e The book is tentatively titled as ‘The Digitization of Money and State’\n\nPersonally, I don't like to focus on the digital/computer/algorithmic aspect of cryptos. The most important thing is that crypto is about _people_ who value individual sovereignty, free speech, meaningful spending, transparency, and fairer games in general. We could build fairer games with ink and paper if we really wanted to, computers and cryptography just happen to be good modern tools to facilitate it.\n\nThat said, I don't oppose the title and don't have a replacement to propose off top of my head. If it turns out to be catchy and more people read what's inside, I'm good with it.\n\n\u003e short attention span and not everyone reads longform books\n\nOur time is tighly packed with streams of information and attention span problem is real. Before reading a piece I see how long it is and whether I have that time now. Unfortunately, longer posts tend to wait in my queue for a long time, and many good ones never make it from there.\n\nThis reality requires us to restructure our content and make it consumable in small chunks. If people read 5% of the book during their lunch breaks, it's better than if they get scared by a large monolithic book and skip it entirely. And if that 5% clicks they can always follow and get more. Another bonus of planning for sliced content from the beginning is that it makes the bits more suitable for reuse by independent advocates.","signature":"d3284f06749d40b1bdd85e0fff47ab7ab22cb16e6bdf2c4de196c7b3fff5e8e00a3209c042b40faf59910948f0eb5565e7fe8dd7f34a29b125d4203ae7d94d0b","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"22","receipt":"dac0a4e04709c65cf25c4cb64f76f981f664e313e4020bb5167d59fc0044a0ea4c3eb9e561866ff8f71b0d2074d9fdf38d9492af51c5dab9cb0050cf1b4d2f0c","timestamp":1611538264,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

(1)\n\nI know that creating content and getting it viewed may require different skills, and being good at one doesn't mean being good at the other. But we have a longstanding problem that all our quality content is getting little views, and this systemic problem requires _everyone_ to think about dissemination, starting from the original authors.\n\n\"More views\" should not be the only goal. I prefer a more nuanced measurement, where a piece of content is deemed successful if it is either (a) got a lot of views, or (b) inspired people who can make a difference, even if few of them. So it's good if the piece got thousands of \"generic\" views, and also good if it triggered a handful of people to use Decred, or do something for it, or advance in what they are already doing. As an edge case example, if the piece gets read by _one_ person but triggers them to become a contractor or bring a hundred of new users from their following, that is success.\n\nConsidering the above, what was the impact of Phase 1 in terms of view counts, discussions triggered in various circles (esp. non-crypto ones), and creativity triggered in others? (2)\n\nPartially answering (1) myself I see that this proposal addresses it in a few ways. First is by using visuals, less technical jargon, and shorter posts to meet less technical audience and shorter attention spans. Second is by preparing easy to use assets to facilitate translations. And third is by choosing where to publish.\n\nOn the latter, I see that the plan is to publish the book on Amazon book store and provide a free PDF download, while ther shorter bits would go on Medium and outlets like Coinmonks. But I think more can be explored here.\n\nOne strategy to try is to publish outside Decred/crypto chambers. For example, drop the short pieces in different finance/economics/sovereignty -themed outles and see how it resonates. Another is to find a way to deliver the link to relevant influencers (tag on Twitter, DM, drop the link in comments of their work, etc).\n\n\u003e try to collaborate with existing Decred community members and researchers wherever possible\n\nAny specific ideas to share? (3)\n\n\u003e Keeping in line with the ethos of free and open source, these papers will be packaged and published as a free book (Amazon Kindle + PDF)\n\nDoes open source assume we'll have access to source files in Markdown/MediaWiki/AsciiDoc/etc?

For transparency for everyone else, bee and I chatted on Matrix about some ideas on how to maximize the outreach potential. \n\nWith regards to the specific questions, I think you did partially answer some of them, but it's worth recapping that Coinmonks (500k monthly readership) is a quantitative data point for outreach. From a qualitative view of 'community impact', there's a few data points: Ana Dalia found one of my papers impact enough that she voluntarily translated them into Spanish.  Pavel S. called the '*why we need decred*' paper of the the best articles he's read in years (and volunteered to [repost it on publish0x](https://www.publish0x.com/withdecred/why-we-need-decred-an-inclusive-approach-to-sound-money-xgdwkjl)). Even in the comments here on Politeia, you'll see Eduardo mention that \"I have learned a lot from Ammar's writings, especially during my early Decred days\".\n\nI'm fortunate to be good friends with our onchain researchers, and would like to specifically incorporate charts about topics like ledger security and coin distribution into the writings. There's definitely a lot of opportunity to tag in more sovereignty themes, especially because there is likely to be ample debate around digital privacy and censorship in the near future.\n\nWith regards to open source: I'm specifically thinking of uploading powerpoint slide templates on Git that can be picked up by the international community managers, for ease of translation. It's also been a shared repo for peer reviews of content before publication.  Happy to use MediaWiki if people find that easier to collaborate.","signature":"88a60ee517a1602c031ef800ed1a4494b8cdca2d84a25e58d6ecf26463d68f8cae1bd053d57fa9cf93ffc549a62de39d5992dbca8c928d1fb5be4f3ca6bc570d","publickey":"7bf956c858f4e123edba7c87b37bf819200c0588abc1ac00d5f8e0f0732bd3e4","commentid":"26","receipt":"5c27ca1ee2d205da620fa264e68cfbaa86a0ddd50240e28867ad8ca967fd31229ef659a4c2de0e96b72e9700bd8cfab21dd33024316ae19d8a535fdfdef86f0e","timestamp":1611803367,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It is also easier to review without complex software, e.g. you might find people who could join the review but don't have PowerPoint installed. Some of our devs [use](https://github.com/decred/dcps) MediaWiki for the extra features it provides compared to Markdown. If MediaWiki is not enough there are other [lightweight markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) formats, and I heard that [AsciiDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc) is used for books.\n\nAn important property of all text-based formats is easy diffing that shows you what has changed between revisions. It is pretty hard to achieve with heavy and complex formats like PowerPoint. Text-based formats also lead to much smaller Git repositories.\n\nWhere .pptx can win is rich software and ease of adding rich graphics and visual effects, while doing everything with a few clicks.\n\nIdeally I would wish that all our slides transition to text-based formats from which all the \"rich\" formats (pdf, pptx, epub) are derived. Text-based formats use less space, are better with revision control and archiving, collaboration, don't require complex/proprietary software, and are more secure (harder to inject malware).","signature":"62f27b5034bab005c1c8723e2df854c619ed27c4847b001aff682016242cd977e31b15deb0a501836a9a348676cac9b96a76749dd44a9cc2c6187e19ec323707","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"27","receipt":"452331abb4d27a3c0398c9e1e53d2ed6dd5ed2166b47d18bb8f31f1948db9f986abf19dff7ff501daf794575faece3c7888e37e783d1386a67e38ab00d70c703","timestamp":1612131522,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It is amazing that _money_ is an extremely common \"social contract\" yet so few people know how it works and how they are getting robbed. I think the root problem is that people in general are not sensitive to processes if they run _slow enough_. But at scale such slow processes can extract tremendous amount of profit from the population without being noticed, until it's too late. This happened so many times in human history, and will happen again and again until people learn where's the bug and shut it down.\n\nI think there's no other way but to talk more about how money works and bring it into the public awareness.","signature":"265cda0dfedb16e1d5e630ecccf1fc0921ef86510f23c8ba8ae574e6df968b91a7c7822650c11b6ea95df7da34d6c98b877106811eaedad9718a9c09e8375602","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"29","receipt":"2f4055b0081c49c674dc30671d9ecd97500422f4f0da7a17597b60825d628684501d3251d886bcd3ba7ea4fb29d3cb5989f061022557e629168ed8ce7434e50c","timestamp":1612493328,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Most of the research is centered around a technical or analytical pov. While I cannot guarantee you a price increase by educating people about Decred, I can guarantee that the *absence *of a monetary understanding does hurt mainstream adoption.\n\n2 and 3)You mentioned that you have reservations about my writing style, although it's tough to exactly respond to this critique without knowing what you didn't like. It's a fair point to reflect on the ideal ratio of depth (Decred) vs breadth (macro framing). **@bee** is correct that that the rationale behind the structure is that most people literally don't know about the existence of topics like DAOs, sound money, and governance. I'm trying to break out of the echo chamber and not 'preaching to the choir', so there is a deliberate effort to establish the problem space before explaining how Decred solves them. Most of the topics will definitely be *pure* about Decred, if that helps.  \n\nFinally, the next paper I'm thinking of working on is around an economic/incentive study of why the Hybrid Consensus model is superior to pure POW. A couple of things I'm planning to study are as follows:\n\n1. POW may not work without inflation\n2. The principal agent problem in pure PoW (i.e. users don't have a voice)\n3. Hybrid model being more energy efficient\n4. Hybrid model providing greater decentralization\n5. Hybrid model providing blockchain security (this will leverage from some of the existing research done by ppl like Check and Zubair)\n\nHope this helps.","signature":"7eaaba9ec690c70afd220db6ef5e21f8e2ee9b60a597e764baf6772bfc503c510cd21f12b35909ff9bc13049d68cd321f5775719d888cb0bffac8e55b3b7990c","publickey":"0d927448c33919346c8a027fcd8af9b4828b5b0df48476b7f4a32391b1d1ab01","commentid":"30","receipt":"797c4771e7152962351537024372405128702816a19602793753d68776e57bf9bf82a7750ef18af7e751c7a867838b252b12fe79fa57c2ded51b0d2ee9b01d0f","timestamp":1612563504,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But another (simple) way to look at it is that two different security layers are better than one. That is, if the PoW layer is hacked or gamed in some way (e.g. AsicBoost), the PoS layer will have a chance to block it until miners are patched. Of course it comes at the cost of complexity (a hybrid can introduce its own issues) so the study must evaluate both sides.","signature":"357c513967ebf4c2ffe020b43cc8c47b2ea066da8d770baf9afa985782ada015f7ffb15e462bc4016d890c6a266142456d2ef43bf7fd2e4867708c386e0a8309","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"31","receipt":"2bc323871f75712dae3468a283967d905743651563dbf86d5ea6ae60b0fc131ff5a38469888f9d210589c367ac99bbd4e81fa350629157f37f868b4b6e96400b","timestamp":1612565327,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
