Decentralized Credits: The Digitization of Money and State (Book)

Hi, I’m @ammarooni. 

This proposal is a continuation of [Phase 1](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/65bde4146b845e7e839d6916d4d8f642bc39c250df5379c2f1e26c4ab778ec1a) of studying Decred in an economic context. The core proposition is to publish a series of papers and engaging visuals which will collectively form the first Decred focused book. 

**Background**:
I’ve been an active community contributor for the past couple of years, having supported Decred through social media, podcasts, conferences, in-person meetups, and longer form writeups. While much of my outreach work to date has been voluntary, a roundup of Ph1 research papers is as follows:
-	[Why we need Decred – A sound money with voice](https://medium.com/coinmonks/why-we-need-decred-an-inclusive-approach-to-sound-money-db2f990c107b) (featured on Coinmonks, 500k monthly visitors)
-	[Decred – An alternative contender](https://ammarooni.medium.com/decred-an-alternative-contender-a3547a014745)
-	[Decred – An economic breakthrough](https://ammarooni.medium.com/decred-an-economic-breakthrough-4d2e3ea27338)
-	[Building a transparent future with the Decred blockchain](https://medium.com/decred/building-a-transparent-future-with-the-decred-blockchain-e77471d28059)
-	Spanish translation of Why we need Decred paper, by Ana Dalia: [Porque Decred es necesario](https://medium.com/decred-es/porque-decred-es-necesario-un-enfoque-inclusivo-sobre-el-dinero-duradero-b8235fb312f3)

***Lessons from Ph1, and guiding principles for this proposal:* **Overall, the community response has been very positive, with a recurring theme on social media to discuss more of the economic and human aspects of Decred’s design. There are two key learnings which I hope to incorporate in this round. 

- **A greater collaboration between research papers and the international community managers:** I will aim to achieve this objective by giving easily sharable visual templates to the international community managers, so that they can easily be translated into other languages.

- **A greater focus on drawing in people from outside the Decred echo chamber:**  This is a more ambitious goal, but one where we have the most potential. The truth is, Decred is a bit deep in the crypto rabbit hole, and we don’t have enough material for non-technical audiences. I’ll look to achieve this objective with a combination of engaging visuals, and an easy to read series of papers which can be used by the DCR community to onboard new users.
 
***Guiding Principle***: The sum of our education efforts should be greater than the individual contributions. A guiding principle will be to try to collaborate with existing Decred community members and researchers wherever possible, in order to tie together a cogent narrative. Qualitative + Quantitative + Multilingual assets = High impact.

**What - The planned deliverables:**
This will be a series of research papers and visuals which can speak to both financial and newbie audiences. The focus will be to study $DCR as a monetary asset, and Decred as a DAO. As a pre-work to this proposal, I've tentatively identified the following topics of research to be explored over the coming months:

- Macro (intro): Why crypto is here to stay, and what makes Decred unique. 
- Macro: The coming inflation and currency wars, and the need for a better Store of Value
- The ideal world reserve currency design: Combining the best of Bitcoin and the IMF Special Drawing Rights
- How Decred’s Hybrid Consensus contributes to both technical security and economic soundness
- The case for Decred as a contrarian hedge to Bitcoin
- A study of Decred's behavioral incentives - network effects in early action
- Exit vs Voice - Bitcoin provides an exit, Decred provides a voice 
- Analyzing Decred through Qiao Wang’s Store of Value Thesis
- Analyzing Decred through Jesse Walden’s steps of progressive decentralization
- DAOs as an evolution to the [nature of firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm).
- Bitcoin as a digital currency, Decred as a digital state
- Decred as a productive store of value
- Contrasting the socio-political designs of Bitcoin and Decred
- The automation of politicians: We need a better solution for decentralized governance
- Nassim Taleb’s teachings and Decred’s design: Creating a digital society from first principles

Keeping in line with the ethos of free and open source, these papers will be packaged and published as a free book (Amazon Kindle + PDF), as well as made available on various community sites and social media. I'll distill them in 8-10 papers and group the content for maximum readability & impact.

**Why:**
One of the key reasons Bitcoin is so successful is because of the amount of education material that draws people into the rabbit hole. Decred has a more complex design than Bitcoin, yet we have only a tiny fraction of the amount of education material.
Social media posts are great, but in order to breakthrough the clutter of altcoins, Decred will benefit from its own version of the Bitcoin standard, which authentically speaks about Decred's design. While Bitcoin has staked a leadership ground on the sound money narrative, Decred can extend this narrative with a DAO narrative.
The Decred developers have delivered so much quality software, but the economic narrative of $DCR as a monetary asset is still in its nascency. Investing in high quality education assets is an important part of community growth, and will serve as a springboard for conversations with  people.

**Risks, Mitigants and Key considerations**
- I am not a developer, but I need to ensure technical correctness. This will be achieved by validating the papers with known community members before publication. This will also help in editing the content for maximum impact.
- Unlike a software deliverable which can be measured by specs, this proposal entails qualitative research. As I explore these topics, their themes may expand or amend if it helps their storytelling. I believe this adaptability will turn out to be a net positive for the end product.
- In order to attract newbies from outside the core Decred community, I will need to speak to macro problem statements, and not every page will be about $DCR. This is required in order to be intellectually honest, and because establishing problems *before* talking about solutions is more impactful than blind shilling. 

**Budget:**
- A burn rate of 1.8k - 2k a month, for 8-10 months = $16K. 
- $1.5k due after publication of book (i.e. editing/citations/publishing process)

**Parting Thoughts:**
- The book is tentatively titled as ‘The Digitization of Money and State’ as a homage to Hayek’s famous Austrian Economic book ‘[The Denationalization of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money)’, while also speaking to Decred's design. There will be some dedicated content around '*Decentralized Credits'*. Open to further inputs on this.
- I understand that crypto degens sometimes have a short attention span and not everyone reads longform books, which is why this proposal will be delivered through a collection of essays and visuals. This pattern also allows for maximum exploration of multidisciplinary themes, and enables a steady stream of consumable content.

I'm happy to receive your feedback and thoughts, and look forward to your support.
Ammar
