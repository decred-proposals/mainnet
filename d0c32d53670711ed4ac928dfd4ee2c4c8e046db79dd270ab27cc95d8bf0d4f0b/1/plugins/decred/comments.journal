Insaf NORI set an example of how things should be done. She takes initiative, she's very hard-working and dedicated to the cause. It's amazing all the things she managed to do pretty much by herself if I'm not mistaken. The designer (Zakaria) also does good work from what I've seen. The asking price here is very modest and only reflects the character of the submitter. \n\nThis is what some of us have been saying: it's possible to do a lot with less when it comes to these localization efforts. This Proposal proves it. \n\nYou have my votes.","signature":"adf67701e8718eed12484c8d339de14a42112ad22e94cf4df5e57a58c2003de319aac07966926814fd5dc2e727c7e91e6dd0ebcd09ead453312507627c0ed501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"675dd08741e716f16109653a0a5ac69b020b5eb613737d2abfb60d575051649342919a3eb9c5802eaba98bef65f33e48022b4e3d9935c5dafd5697d947d07a0d","timestamp":1610898220,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
