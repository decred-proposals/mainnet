Insaf NORI set an example of how things should be done. She takes initiative, she's very hard-working and dedicated to the cause. It's amazing all the things she managed to do pretty much by herself if I'm not mistaken. The designer (Zakaria) also does good work from what I've seen. The asking price here is very modest and only reflects the character of the submitter. \n\nThis is what some of us have been saying: it's possible to do a lot with less when it comes to these localization efforts. This Proposal proves it. \n\nYou have my votes.","signature":"adf67701e8718eed12484c8d339de14a42112ad22e94cf4df5e57a58c2003de319aac07966926814fd5dc2e727c7e91e6dd0ebcd09ead453312507627c0ed501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"675dd08741e716f16109653a0a5ac69b020b5eb613737d2abfb60d575051649342919a3eb9c5802eaba98bef65f33e48022b4e3d9935c5dafd5697d947d07a0d","timestamp":1610898220,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You never know when Decred starts getting traction in a given region, but when that happens we'd better have people sitting on the phone.\n\nAlso, the chain of events leading to this shows what I have learned long ago in this project - when you start from scratch you may have to work for years before it starts getting traction, and many cannot run that long.\n\nWe're very lucky to have @arij for this role. She has been organically growing Decred in Arabic from scratch for 2 years, she is very positive and learning every day. I don't speak Arabic but based on my observations of the activity and our numerous chats, I see that she loves this project and is very persisting to achieve results.\n\n@arij please recruit more people like you :)\n\n_Disclaimer: after @arij has [translated](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) almost 24 months of DJs and made a [Decred Cake](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202002.html) I am irreversibly supportive._","signature":"07e82b52368796186ee8a8d31df1536442895caba9d5f37cc2489ea28f8dd8fe01db31660b7d24320de1530fe71504ada2298ecfed3310f956b7ef7a5df5d002","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"7","receipt":"ba968537058ae49ee6bec914a85a2b2845d4d40bcc9a8dc053adc7daf5bbee93e3b7914ce8bd313b82e9019c7a5a9032f2513d357050db9f5d4224e9a355d404","timestamp":1610927846,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I hope you can distinguish a paid smile from a real one.\n\nYou can argue that paid marketing is a disadvantage because \"Bitcoin did it organically\" and that true crypto should have none.\n\nI argue the opposite. What matters is that we hire the right people who achieve results in ethical ways. Hoping for organic marketing likely will not work in a market saturated with 3K+ coins. And I am deeply not convinced that Bitcoin/Ethereum got no paid marketing.\n\nIn fact I think paid marketing can be an advantage because we are transparent about it. And it is awesome when the treasury can reward people for useful work so they can keep doing it without worrying about working elsewhere to survive.\n\nIt is strange that you mention \"reversing course\" and \"rising prevalence of paid crypto marketing\" when in fact we are reversing course and having marketing expenses significantly reduced.\n\nThe risk of Decred getting stigmatized as MLM depends on _how_ we \"market\" it.

And we all want people to do this in whichever way they can. But bear in mind the optics of *doing them for pay*.\n\nIt isn't the day-to-day promotion you do that counts, but what that promotion *represents*. No matter how good the paid promotion, it always carries with it the stigma of paying for friends. It is fundamentally superficial and inorganic. If there truly is no core narrative in Decred worthy of the media's attention as evidenced by real user activity, the solution isn't to pay an army of paid promoters. Yes, the paid promoters may get traction, but the optics are suicidal.\n\nPeople just don't seem to get this: they look at their two hands in front of them and think, e.g. “I just need money to promote”. They don't see it being part of a larger narrative they are participating in. What does it represent to a global audience of cold, cranky investors not there on the ground? If you are paying for all of your coin's marketing, and everyone who is even *considering* marketing your coin is aiming to get *paid to do it*, what does that say about your coin? What is the larger narrative there? Is it a useful one?\n\nThe discussion at hand is whether people should continue to think they can “work” for Decred by contributing “marketing”. There are hugely negative repercussions of moving in this direction — no doubt spread out over several years — and the upsides of paid crypto promotion are all but nonexistent.\n\nAlternatively, Politeia could be deliberately capped to compensating scientists and engineers who possess rare skills in high demand.

If you published an academic paper pertaining to and/or funded by Decred, that paper is going to be promoted organically if it is even remotely interesting to investors, as proven by many years of Bitcoin history.\n\nCoins which lather on the *paid* marketing thick were historically often scammy. Yet despite this, it's obvious that the #1 use case of Politeia is to ask for marketing funding.

But mind that we don't reward for X units sold like Herbalife does. I attended some MLM events and talked to a few MLM salesmen, man these people are scary zealots.\n\nIt is highly misleading to present MLM as the only example of paid marketing. Any company producing something hires people to do paid marketing. It is higly likely that you like at least one product on this planet that has paid marketing people.\n\nIf your concern is that _all_ Decred marketing/outreach/representation becomes paid, yes that would look super sad. But I think it won't happen:\n\n- to my knowledge all contractors who get paid anything for outreach do much more of it for free on top of the paid work\n- there are a lot of free and organic representation on top of it (with varying quality)\n- there are a lot of barriers to get paid for it, starting from paying Pi registration and proposal fees, to winning the vote, to passing invoice review.

It is fundamentally superficial and inorganic.\n\n\"Shilling\" is a problem and we should avoid it. It happens when all one cares about is money, or protecting one's belief system, or both.\n\nI think you totally exclude the scenario where one promotes what he loves and believes in _and_ finds a way to get paid for it. It is a good scenario to be in! Same for developers and researchers, it is good to build something you love, but even better to also get paid for it. Problems begin when you start mixing things in your head and forgetting the creative impulse.\n\nThis way of thinking reminds me how it is \"common\" to talk about jobs: \"I hate my job\", \"can't wait to leave this ***ing office\", \"these meetings are useless, this job is useless\", \"oh man you have a paid job? It must suck for you, but we have no choice\".\n\nI think the world is changing and doing what you love _and_ getting paid for it will get more common.\n\n\u003e If there truly is no core narrative in Decred worthy of the **media**'s attention\n\nI hope you are aware how mainstream media is performing recently in terms of doing its job of informing people of _important_ things with minimum bias.\n\n\u003e If you are paying for all of your coin's marketing\n\nAgain you keep leveraging the argument that _all_ marketing will get paid, that getting paid will become the only motivation to promote Decred, and it will send us into the MLM reputational death spiral.

If we don't ban them, we'll create bad precendent and will eventually have only paid research. This will create suicidal optics and people will accuse us of doing paid research to support our agendas and compare us to the big pharma scams. Also, scientists are only motivated by money these days. They will convince us how valuable their research is and \"find\" us what we want to see, only to drain the treasury.\n\n\u003e Most developers need to be banned from Politeia as well. Most of them write bad code that will need to be rewritten anyway. Also, they tend to pull in their friends who are also bad programmers, and then they approve each other's DCC and code reviews. Together they will infinitely convince us to fund a never ending refactoring and rewriting of the growing set of their projects, that nobody uses.\n\n\u003e While there, we should also ban all designers from getting paid. They tend to conspire with marketers and developers to spend dozens of hours on those images that volunteers should be able to photoshop five times faster, for free. And those images are useless anyway. Their UX work also must be defunded, I suspect that they employ some planned obsolescence techniques and keep redesigning things forever, and if we don't put an end to it soon we will have no choice but to pay for this.","signature":"48cd972c76a109f394a415e551729ae8bf1a0afd4214f6f62dbd3ad989f827c0916f0da4176510af734a7741ee70459ca256975572025441227622308e252509","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"20","receipt":"6e40fe93984c62985ba7ec4ba017c23e7abe4cf62de0125e3c24c482d5afa19bb1ef941d71e3b069c7f8c9efdc0a502b966b4279aa71ae5db79510f085990007","timestamp":1611554361,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
