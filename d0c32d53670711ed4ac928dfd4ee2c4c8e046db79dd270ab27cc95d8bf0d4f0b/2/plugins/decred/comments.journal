Insaf NORI set an example of how things should be done. She takes initiative, she's very hard-working and dedicated to the cause. It's amazing all the things she managed to do pretty much by herself if I'm not mistaken. The designer (Zakaria) also does good work from what I've seen. The asking price here is very modest and only reflects the character of the submitter. \n\nThis is what some of us have been saying: it's possible to do a lot with less when it comes to these localization efforts. This Proposal proves it. \n\nYou have my votes.","signature":"adf67701e8718eed12484c8d339de14a42112ad22e94cf4df5e57a58c2003de319aac07966926814fd5dc2e727c7e91e6dd0ebcd09ead453312507627c0ed501","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"1","receipt":"675dd08741e716f16109653a0a5ac69b020b5eb613737d2abfb60d575051649342919a3eb9c5802eaba98bef65f33e48022b4e3d9935c5dafd5697d947d07a0d","timestamp":1610898220,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

You never know when Decred starts getting traction in a given region, but when that happens we'd better have people sitting on the phone.\n\nAlso, the chain of events leading to this shows what I have learned long ago in this project - when you start from scratch you may have to work for years before it starts getting traction, and many cannot run that long.\n\nWe're very lucky to have @arij for this role. She has been organically growing Decred in Arabic from scratch for 2 years, she is very positive and learning every day. I don't speak Arabic but based on my observations of the activity and our numerous chats, I see that she loves this project and is very persisting to achieve results.\n\n@arij please recruit more people like you :)\n\n_Disclaimer: after @arij has [translated](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) almost 24 months of DJs and made a [Decred Cake](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/journal/202002.html) I am irreversibly supportive._","signature":"07e82b52368796186ee8a8d31df1536442895caba9d5f37cc2489ea28f8dd8fe01db31660b7d24320de1530fe71504ada2298ecfed3310f956b7ef7a5df5d002","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"7","receipt":"ba968537058ae49ee6bec914a85a2b2845d4d40bcc9a8dc053adc7daf5bbee93e3b7914ce8bd313b82e9019c7a5a9032f2513d357050db9f5d4224e9a355d404","timestamp":1610927846,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I hope you can distinguish a paid smile from a real one.\n\nYou can argue that paid marketing is a disadvantage because \"Bitcoin did it organically\" and that true crypto should have none.\n\nI argue the opposite. What matters is that we hire the right people who achieve results in ethical ways. Hoping for organic marketing likely will not work in a market saturated with 3K+ coins. And I am deeply not convinced that Bitcoin/Ethereum got no paid marketing.\n\nIn fact I think paid marketing can be an advantage because we are transparent about it. And it is awesome when the treasury can reward people for useful work so they can keep doing it without worrying about working elsewhere to survive.\n\nIt is strange that you mention \"reversing course\" and \"rising prevalence of paid crypto marketing\" when in fact we are reversing course and having marketing expenses significantly reduced.\n\nThe risk of Decred getting stigmatized as MLM depends on _how_ we \"market\" it.

And we all want people to do this in whichever way they can. But bear in mind the optics of *doing them for pay*.\n\nIt isn't the day-to-day promotion you do that counts, but what that promotion *represents*. No matter how good the paid promotion, it always carries with it the stigma of paying for friends. It is fundamentally superficial and inorganic. If there truly is no core narrative in Decred worthy of the media's attention as evidenced by real user activity, the solution isn't to pay an army of paid promoters. Yes, the paid promoters may get traction, but the optics are suicidal.\n\nPeople just don't seem to get this: they look at their two hands in front of them and think, e.g. “I just need money to promote”. They don't see it being part of a larger narrative they are participating in. What does it represent to a global audience of cold, cranky investors not there on the ground? If you are paying for all of your coin's marketing, and everyone who is even *considering* marketing your coin is aiming to get *paid to do it*, what does that say about your coin? What is the larger narrative there? Is it a useful one?\n\nThe discussion at hand is whether people should continue to think they can “work” for Decred by contributing “marketing”. There are hugely negative repercussions of moving in this direction — no doubt spread out over several years — and the upsides of paid crypto promotion are all but nonexistent.\n\nAlternatively, Politeia could be deliberately capped to compensating scientists and engineers who possess rare skills in high demand.
