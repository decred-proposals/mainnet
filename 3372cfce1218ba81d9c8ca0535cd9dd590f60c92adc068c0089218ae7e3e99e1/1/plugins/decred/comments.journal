How many cost twitter paid ads and what is the strategy? Maybe that with the workgroup you can discuss and research to bring all the details.\n\u003e Creating video content such as Decred videos\n\nWe already have very good videos from Exitus, but even if you still want to make others, I would like to see a description similar to his proposal, what content will you prepare, how many hours recording, how many hours to edition, how many videos, when you deliver this content.\n\u003e Creating marketing materials\n\nWhat kind of materials, what the value you will ask in these platforms?\n\u003e ...name out there in media buys, blog contributors, etc.\n\nIsn't this PR's job? If not, what would be your focus, any specific blog/site, what is the amount to be spent on each one?\n\u003e Paid ads targeted to the crypto community...\n\nvalue and platforms?\n\u003e Proposal Author is acting as a volunteer...\n\nThere is so much work here, maybe you must bill for that and get some help.","signature":"7ae56385de28f8251b2aac408377c4bbe859c1d57add3561fd0720a43697fea5e15c568e9058a566e5e15e99dfd50c0f6706f3c29423eacdfc1e94e51c548e02","publickey":"8b9ada0d6179d50cfa1ce35814df98988517757c54f76cdbbabf6f99cce42fd8","commentid":"1","receipt":"f97cb4ec2ac9f27ca3e351e1f8d4210916727516969817a563d56ed732abd18a78a0092088c02abc682c071d68ca4490b19655a971e52b7ed7251a3b21209d00","timestamp":1596198012,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I think it's interesting to discuss these types of approaches but if they were to be deployed with Treasury support I think that could be quite a delicate issue. There's a risk that this kind approach could damage the positive aspects of Decred's reputation with poorly chosen \"shout-out partners\" or copy for ads, so I would be more comfortable if it was being driven by people who have a more established track record in the community.\n\nFor the costs associated with these promotional activities, I saw a comment in the Discord channel which suggested you might be able to cover these up-front and claim it back from the Treasury? That kind of detail would be good to include in the proposal.","signature":"f8e8f19604f0d8987019c16b1e98aa3198fbe6a2bd77e5182f08883f6787a77edff4cc7b15c6b3638102380d24deb43cf6931d0845b65ad1c7682f6d2eab4d0a","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"2","receipt":"657aea1cc4dea29c919abb4d38e801fc931f4c54ab4222db1d45c711cec2a14a57dcdcc2b9c834fc0c8b24c8ba00294cf3e13d5771cb91abc8312f8515650208","timestamp":1596201688,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
