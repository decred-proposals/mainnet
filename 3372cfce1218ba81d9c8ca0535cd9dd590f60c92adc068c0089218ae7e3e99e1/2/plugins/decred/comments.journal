A good concept is, taking existing pro-DCR tweets, and having people outside of the DCR community retweet it, for the word to reach their respective audiences outside of the DCR community. This strategy would be employed to promote educational DCR content, rather than blatant shilling which doesn't look good. Using social media, not just Twitter, to help increase awareness and educate the greater crypto community.\n\n\u003e For the costs associated with these promotional activities, I saw a comment in the Discord channel which suggested you might be able to cover these up-front and claim it back from the Treasury? That kind of detail would be good to include in the proposal.\n\nThis was originally an idea, it may also be. But it's important for me to test the politea system, and how community governance works. The vision I have for Decred is being a DAO, where people with best interests come forward and contribute to the community. The way I am doing this is, I've introduced myself to the community for a while. Became a stakeholder, now I created a Marketing Workgroup with some community members, and these funds will act as a pool for our workgroup to execute tasks. \n\nIt doesn't look quite as attractive if I needed to front the funding, and then bill treasury. This way of request feels more organic of a movement.","signature":"80a0c85fe593cfbb185a79baff1551fd91b0bd8f32804dd800acab9a388c09366fbad81723430293603c00bd24d0b119a53176fc8e3a291940d3f337fc237a03","publickey":"32897bbb15aecbb302093b61a5b037f86e2c5f73a1b9268009edcd331d958e29","commentid":"3","receipt":"f08075d9c1ce7f5d4f8e703bdaffb8a2ceba48d724f3d83960444022a49341f6c026b1e980a6204dad49864a3934089ab22c67fdbd26ecced8a6963c36c88b0e","timestamp":1596206472,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

How many cost twitter paid ads and what is the strategy? Maybe that with the workgroup you can discuss and research to bring all the details.\n\nThe strategy for the tweets and retweets is allocating a fraction of the funds to incentivize retweets of DCR content, or create new content. One opportunity which also exists is creating a tweet which well defines the ethos of the @decredproject and pinning and promoting that as a paid ad. For example:\n\nDecred - Secure, adaptable, sustainable\n21 million\nFair distribution\nBuilt in staking rewards\nPrivacy\nRockstar developers\n\nLike Retweet \nPromoted\n\nSomething similar to that, is just an example. \n\n\u003e We already have very good videos from Exitus, but even if you still want to make others, I would like to see a description similar to his proposal, what content will you prepare, how many hours recording, how many hours to edition, how many videos, when you deliver this content.\n\nExitus has great videos, but they aren't being advertised afaik. I will provide the example of the main way I want to use the videos. It's creating multiple 10 second videos, such as \"Decred offers 6% interest through the staking mechanism. Swipe up to learn more\", \"Tired of politicians playing games with your money? Decred has a politea voting system to bring back voting with your money\" \"Tired of paying high BTC transaction fees? Use Decred's network for a faster crypto experience!\" (These are all just examples)\n\nThen, we can run paid ad campaigns on things like Snapchat, and other social media, targetted to informing the world and these non-crypto users about Decred. Out of all the methods, this one I think has the potential to generate the best return. Snapchat ad campaigns have been proven very effective for generating new interest for financial related projects. \n\nThe main goal here would be to bring new users and new interest to Decred. They start buying and staking. \n\n\u003e What kind of materials, what the value you will ask in these platforms?\n\nSimilar to whats described above, media content, and promoting that said media content.\n\n\u003e Isn't this PR's job? If not, what would be your focus, any specific blog/site, what is the amount to be spent on each one?\n\nIt could be, but I have not interacted with him yet. But I have a guy who publishes press releases on top sites like Forbes, Business, etc. It could also be a good idea for these funds to be spent here.\n\n\u003e There is so much work here, maybe you must bill for that and get some help.\n\nNo, I don't want to bill for myself. This funding will pay for the expenses that managing and running this campaign will incur. \n\nI intend to use the $10k for 3 things mainly. \n\nTwitter retweets, social media virality. Creating videos and running them on Snapchat etc, getting Decred's word out through big websites, and possibly anything else we have remaining funding for.","signature":"e8bca9b09641d8787e66cdf839ebc9c821d3811d42f75d7ef93f6af876361dad8812c111c00fb38a7eb5e29fdfdefd3a5ab6bda9477a64042cab8733b8e74402","publickey":"32897bbb15aecbb302093b61a5b037f86e2c5f73a1b9268009edcd331d958e29","commentid":"4","receipt":"3a198c80c87439d358a22643d07bdf03b7642a783ef0479389fd6d5cb054987ae2b6ec7efdc4716f5f1456bdb4574ac27248904d99c9f319b7ddf4c25159530a","timestamp":1596207383,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I would like to echo Richard-Reds comments on two points. 1) Treasury works as a back-payment system rather than upfront and 2) There is non-trivial risk that paid promotion can go astray and backfire (lots of scam coins as evidence). The message needs to be well defined to ensure it maintains Decred brand ethos. What I would personally prefer to see is further definition on what exactly is planned for delivery. Who are the influencers being targeted? What are examples of the content to be disseminated and who is the target audience?\n\nI believe it is important that stakeholders continue to maintain Treasury protocol of de-risking as much as possible by getting a well established plan of what will be delivered and the message that is being sent. This is not to say I don't assume you have the best interests of the project at heart, it is because we will have an increasing volume of proposals as the project grows and all must stand up to the same benchmark test.\n\nIn summary, direction and intent is good, recommend you deliver some sample works and further definition added to the specific deliverables and message to be sent.

Otherwise two bits of feedback: \n\n1. I don't think it's any good practice to propose for work without an assembled team who will be involved in actual work. Especially when there is no prior track-record of contributions. Hiring creatives from crowdwork sites like fiverr and upwork is a dodgy approach, unlikely to bring decent results, due to both subcontracting low or entry skill level production/writing/design people, as well them having likely having no or little understanding on DCR and blockchain in general. Someone with a superficial understanding of what they work on is unlikely to do their best work. A better way would be finding the actual people first upfront and getting them well onboarded on what's what already, as this is no trivial task.\n\n2. It's worth looking into and learning about what's been made in the past in terms of paid ads, .ie beanstalk stuff? Iirc these were dropped altogether during sm cryptobans in 2018. Not sure how many results they brought before that. I'm personally on the opinion that most forms of paid ads are not particularly effective, [and come off like this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/470/033/88a.jpg). Specifically, banners and all kinds of in-between \"blocks\" on sm are an utter nuisance. Considering most people are mentally desensitized towards noticing ads, there's growing privacy trends, browsers are wrapped in condoms, browsing in no-js etc. I wouldn't want to see just some artificial attention being generated, which just fades out when the ad cash stops.","signature":"0ec490685d9b69e336bef3dd88bdebb07d1ffd0afc635e936d91e5d50243167bbc95c0e969302f1f20df948e949deb3ee1c0e71ce107e6a2326ce5c109c15c03","publickey":"3ebccc98869770517dbf6fd787b9bc02f2e75ea1d42089b90e26dde3b2499859","commentid":"8","receipt":"922b7c61e964a1e9c8a2a64810535af490a7ce0b0a56d9ace4cbccbc8ee1b9becdabdbc7ed5ffa3425a21b38666d4133669700c6c74e2c7ce3f9f0cc5b37ad0b","timestamp":1596396026,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
