**Motivation**

Currently, there is a need for additional marketing efforts to promote Decred and attract new users. The goal of this proposal is to use $10k of treasury funds is to fund a variety of marketing strategies to drive traffic to Decred, and generate new user interest. I am acting as a volunteer, and this $10k will be used to pay for the expenses to begin a unique marketing campaign.

**About me:**

I am a stakeholder in Decred, you may see me on Twitter often username fst_nml. I am a big supporter of Decred, and want help grow traffic of this network. I have a background in management of SEO, content creation, graphic design, etc. We can try different things to make more people notice Decred.

**Examples of strategies this proposal will fund:**

·	Twitter and social media, retweets, endorsements, paid ads, etc. Promotional content.

·	Creating video content such as Decred videos, financial educational content, etc. These videos can educate people about common crypto terms such as full node, etc. Put these on YouTube. 

·	Creating marketing materials from websites such as Upwork, Fiverr, etc

·	Increasing awareness in the project by getting the name out there in media buys, blog contributors, etc.

·	Paid ads targeted to the crypto community using graphics, gifs, videos.

And any other ideas which seem like they would provide a good ROI. The goal is to be creative, and generate a result for Decred, in a cost-effective manner. Please note, even though my twitter handle is fst_nml, marketing efforts will still be going even if my twitter handle is not posting much.

**Benefits of marketing:**

Price goes up.  The network grows.

There are many ways marketing can benefit the Decred Network. I will use myself as an example, maybe a year or two ago, something as simple as Charlie Lee writing that Decred has a very talented developer community attracted me to look into the coin. Just one simple tweet, brought me in as an stakeholder. Now, if we had many Twitter influencers discussing Decred, this can help bring in a lot more eyes to the project. The goal is to drive organic traffic to the network.
Every $1 that DCR raises in price, would increase the treasury funds by approximately $600k. By dedicating amount of the treasury towards marketing, we have a great opportunity to increase our treasury value for future projects by investing a small portion into marketing. If our marketing efforts succeed, a small investment has the opportunity to almost double our treasury funds and create new specialized arms of this DAO.

**Payment & Details:**

Proposal Author is requesting $10k equivalent advance from the treasury funds, and will be used to pay expenses for ongoing marketing efforts.

Proposal Author is acting as a volunteer for these marketing efforts, and not taking a salary.
