**A few less technical ways to think about this project**
*

- More than just products to buy with crypto it’s the association you want with trusted projects in the crypto community and more broadly household brands. 
- You can say to the haters “That Decred isn’t real” with “You can buy flights and hotels with it so that is pretty real”.
- The best marketing is winning hearts and minds. The relationship with us would be a big step in this direction.
