Also, I strongly believe that demand for such integrations should come from your customers and not the other way round. I would be happy to reconsider this proposal when there is such strong demand.

Their business model is accepting crypto for flights and stuff. If they want DCR traffic, they should implement it. But I don't think it's worth it for the DCR community to pay for that specific implementation of flights and stuff when there is alot of other options available for that, even using DCR.\n\nOther than the 5 storys of Decred, it doesn't seem worth it. Basically, I don't want to pay $51k for 5 articles.\n\nThat is a bad value proposition in my opinion.","signature":"847db0f610013a4502fb1541dfd40262a1966d866ef1c325d54dcad0430d2d256d590216f1c8285fafb411c08d407f58990fa14c9327d8f68245e709dc3be40f","publickey":"32897bbb15aecbb302093b61a5b037f86e2c5f73a1b9268009edcd331d958e29","commentid":"3","receipt":"9db9d1b6750aba82df25c651d922a93e5060e7e12fd1acadb5e05af77e972460b9932d2cad9b168b3a4c1b6b4da771c98775bc6eee230d8cbe933e35abde0c06","timestamp":1596138179,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Let me break this down a bit.\n\nWith what I am going to call a version One Partnership -\nLet's start with what has happened to projects who work with us - Notably would be NEM's who increased their market cap 20% on the announcement and most recently SWIPE with a huge rally to their native token.\nNow, that was just the announcement. We continue to provide value with regular reports on how the token is being used when we partner with more mainstream travel brands and their communities. \n\nHere is the difference in what I am going to call a version Two partnership - (What is above)\nWe plan for the opportunity to attract new users to DCR, and boost engagement of existing holders. (Ultimately what I think your marketing goals would be?)\n- Whitelabel version of the DCR site \n- 12 months or targeting advertising (That is user-based not location-based so we get the message in front of the right people)\n-  Some launch activity to activate the base and give them collateral to share around\n- A long term partnership to ensure that future travel industry partnerships do benefit both of us \n- Regular reporting of usage of the currency proving the use case (putting money where your mouth is so to speak) - The best kind of PR is doing!\n- A discounted rate for listing ( Which I am against as it reduces the barrier to entry for projects, the higher the better as it shrinks the community that can get involved increasing the value of the opportunity. If everyone could afford a Ferrari they wouldn't be cool) just $15K to play instead of the standard $50K. \n\n\nMaybe I am still off base, so let me talk about my credentials for a second. I have doubled the sales of global travel businesses around the world and helped grow several startups to million-dollar evaluations in under 6months  through marketing, advertising, product and PR. If you still dont see the point, Cool.","signature":"eb0bc51099668dd7bfe8ed9eecb1bdd8d8b3a666f5642dd0c8cf90cd5c43e1a0065c17f3e37b5e170d7de7d04ec1b06db88273b687524ebcecc10666d86db802","publickey":"7805f6391bd83260aa5009c143fdf0eea1d44266bb5b5de25ed51e830fbbe29e","commentid":"4","receipt":"d5876d6732906192deff6ffb06197d61ab1e36fd9f9340840c1062cc4a635cf6288ec8bc43da95a4e93dbff3e0662b7aeb9384d70a182d57499f8d3beb2a5600","timestamp":1596160162,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
