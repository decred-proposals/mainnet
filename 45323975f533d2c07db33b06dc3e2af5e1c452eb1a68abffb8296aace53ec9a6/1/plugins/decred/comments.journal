When I was coming up with my own taglines incidentally I always used the word \"evolving\" too. The only word I'm not entirely sure of, is \"sound\", just because I'm wondering about the general public familiarity with it. I wish the people who originally came up with the term chose a more \"chad\" word, like \"Hardened\" or something like that. Anyway, it's a strong candidate for a tagline, the best one yet. Other than that, this Proposal can be seen as a dividing line between old and new messaging, it can be a reboot button to all of DCR marketing. It really touches upon the essential point: it's the whole \"spirit\" of the messaging that has to change. All other messaging proposals I have seen - even though they're good and one can see a lot of effort has been put into them - they suffer from a kind of inability to draw people's attention. The messaging has to be concise and powerful. It has to exude dragon energy. Tiger's blood, as Charlie Cheen would say. : ) Seriously it made me excited about the DCR project just reading through this Proposal...

Words like \"sustainable\" and \"fair\" are virgin words that put us on the defensive right off the bat and associate us with SJW snowflakes.\n\nWhile you have a point here about words which can put us on the defensive, I think it makes sense to take a strong position on \"fairness\" because some of the main arguments against a system like Decred's (the PoS component) are about this. Decred has taken steps to mitigate the aspects of PoS which are seen as unfair (rich get richer dynamic or digital feudalism), and to address the lack of fairness associated with systems that give developers or miners much more say than users. It also feeds into things like DEX, you can make a pretty compelling argument in a couple of pages that Decred has considered its position on what's fair and this feeds into how the project is set up and what it does.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that there's competition for a lot of these \"strong\" terms, how many projects are aiming to make some sort of \"sound money\"? From what I have seen there are far fewer projects competing on a concept like \"fairness\", or if they are they're not strong competitors (have you seen the DeFi version of a \"fair launch\"?). Fairness is also a concept that will I think resonate more strongly with different people than the \"sound money\" concept, and if we're looking to grow a community finding people who aren't already super into Bitcoin or Ethereum or some other crypto project is important in and of itself.","signature":"8b9553ad1732d2788170a33836e085a6f374d0b1acde47e1efb1132094fec676f7a270a52459dc482757165e7841b41add63d766885134ffd110815934c67f0c","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"8","receipt":"2baafe294aeb5cde62b5d30e4a1269284da1ad90fae8e8667caab2307b0085d8e91b5fa4acd5d71062225b49fb8b3b337631ce6ada97082c1ce71a0294dd410b","timestamp":1601303457,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
