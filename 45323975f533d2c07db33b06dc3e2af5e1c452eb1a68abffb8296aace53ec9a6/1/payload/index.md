_Caveat: This proposal is only half serious, nobody should vote for it, however I'm hoping it will offer some food for thought, influence some of the more thorough proposals, and potentially inspire the use of alternative messaging in places beyond decred.org._

## Why is our messaging so screwed up?
The short answer is; many of the people involved in crafting it are too smart and we're trying to present a unified explanation of everything.

We have intellectual heavyweights opining on how to connect with regular people, they'd need to get a lobotomy to write compelling marketing copy.

_Enter jz..._

Decred is the _Chad Coin_, I propose we tell people about it in relatable terms, the current messaging on the website is good enough for now, what we need is alternative messaging everywhere else that's concise and approachable.

_See attached image for an example of the power of memetics illustrated through the use of the Chad/Virgin prism._

I've played a small part in our current messaging and in retrospect, it seems crazy that it's so convoluted, we've attempted to tick too many boxes.

If we assume that Decred _sells itself_ to highly intelligent people who are capable of doing research, reading docs, and tomes that our community has produced outlining the value proposition then there's no point in creating messaging which appeals to that minority.  Likewise, if the message is getting nods from people that are spending their whole day thinking about Decred it's probably obtuse.

So for the better part of half a decade I've been pitching Decred to people under the assumption that those who get involved early in the organization will have a tremendous impact on our long term success, as stakeholders are essentially the directors if you will, that sit on the board of our virtual central bank and defend sound monetary policy, while shaping how the technology develops.

Through that lens, one can appreciate the importance of the project never taking the easy route and raising VC money or doing an ICO and attracting individuals looking for an exit with high time preference.

You acquire influence in Decred by putting _skin in the game_ via the open market, no sweetheart deals, no preferential treatment.

People who get all that stuff and our underlying philosophy aren't the ones we're trying to reach now, we're trying to switch gears to _mass appeal_ model; bringing people in and _then_ educating them, however, we're ill-equipped to reach that market using the advanced theories and specialized nomenclature that attracted what I'd refer to as the _unshakable foundation_ of solid stakeholders we have today.

## Cool tech, armored lizards

We live in an era of aspirational consumption, people buy running shoes that make them feel like they're not slobs who have no need for running shoes.

Their financial choices will be no different, why would you _buy_ money that makes you feel dumb and sounds complicated?

I believe myself to be uniquely qualified to pontificate on this, spending most of my day around Decred folks who are much smarter than me and yet having enough interaction with the world outside our bubble to appreciate how early we are and how overwhelming and unapproachable a lot of this technology is to regular people, including those that are among the more financially savvy.  Messaging always needs to be simple.

Some time ago we embarked on the path of communicating the _store of value candidate_ potential of Decred, it is fundamentally the first level of the _money thesis_ from which everything else branches out.

Murad was instrumental in elucidating the importance of that narrative and the _anxiety reduction theory of money_, but his armored lizard meme might have been his magnum opus of Decred messaging.

I find it paradoxical that our messaging evokes the exact opposite emotion we're striving for; it _maximizes_ anxiety.  If you talk to regular people who can only name half a dozen cryptocurrencies or those who spend their time investing in virtual food tokens you've never heard of, suddenly it becomes clear that the distinguishing factor for us must grab the target's attention and not make too many assumptions about their level of knowledge, as most lack a mental framework to deal with the myriad of concepts someone would need to grasp in order to appreciate the value of Decred and reason for its existence.

Austrian economics, game theory, governance of competing coins using "rough consensus", none of that means anything to anyone but the most hardcore market participants.  If you need to define the specific meanings of words to explain your tagline you've run amok.  After ten years in this space, I still consider myself to be a beginner, we need to be able to communicate with other beginners, as well as those who don't even know where to begin.

* **Secure.  Adaptable.  Sustainable.** isn't the pinnacle of messaging but it's catchy enough, it doesn't really give anybody tingles and it's not sexy though.

* **Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money for a Fairer Financial System** makes me shake my head.

Eleven letter words are a non-starter.  Assume our target audience borders on _illiterate_ (forget about getting them to write/pronounce Decrediton or Politeia).

These are the types of words that should be used in marketing copy: [Basic words.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_1000_basic_words)
If we're using words that aren't on that list they should be short and so badass that they evoke visions of armed reptoids assaulting a broken financial system and evolving to keep pace with an ever-changing battlefield.

We need to speak memes.

Aside: When attempting to promote a nascent brand it makes little sense to dilute the message with useless historical context.  Just today someone was commenting on "decentralized credit(s)" and how confusing it is.  I agreed wholeheartedly and gave the analogy of how nobody uses _Federal Express_ to describe _FedEx_ or _Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing_ when talking about _3M_, the brands evolved, the details are just for historians, the answer to _why the name Decred?_ doesn't need to be anything more than _because it's cool sounding._ Nobody needs to hear a smug etymology of our name.  There's also no reason for _credits_, _atoms_, or _DAOs_ to even be in our marketing lexicon.

We need to stay laser-focused on the basic message and be unwavering.

## Let your dreams become memes

Now it's time to go off the rails a bit...  Words like "sustainable" and "fair" are _virgin_ words that put us on the defensive right off the bat and associate us with SJW snowflakes.

_But Proof-of-Work uses electricity and kills baby seals how is it sustainable!?!_

_It's not fair if it's not one person one vote, I'm entitled to a say even though I don't own any!!!_

When a word gets co-opted like _fair_ has, to mean _equality of outcome_, it becomes toxic for marketing purposes because you've caused cognitive dissonance before you've even had a chance to start selling your idea.

You're now having a debate on hermeneutics and everyone wishes you weren't invited to the party you're at.

```
Virgin words              Chad words
---------------           ---------------
Fair                      Strong
Adaptable                 Evolve
Governance                Power
Safe                      Hard
Decentralized             Money
Stable                    Risk (SITG)
Ossified                  Sound
Community                 Private
```

## The dev litmus test
* If devs are giving you high fives for the accuracy of your marketing content you've screwed up beyond belief.
* Code and docs need to be accurate, marketing needs to be vague and border on nonsensical.
* If you've seen successful marketers they're indistinguishable from morons or religious leaders.

Take two great marketers of the 21st century; Steve Jobs and Donald Trump, they both sell (or sold) hype.  If you can't imagine those two guys saying something then it probably has no mass appeal.

Look in the mirror, point at yourself using 4 fingers from your tiny hand, make a Trump face, and say the Decred catchphrase you're contemplating.  That's how you know if it has legs.

You should feel like you're about to embark on a divine mission not like you need to buy a dictionary or go to college to even begin deciphering what the message is.


## Tagline

I should probably do something constructive in this proposal so here's a tagline I've been toying with.

```
Decred: Sound Money Evolved
        --1-- --2-- ---3---
```

1.  Sound is hard, immutable, all those good things.
2.  Everybody knows what money is, nothing is sexier.
3.  Tech that can evolve is robust, also sounds cool.

We also need is to start formulating statements that describe Decred at a very high level, become masters of the metaphor, and adept in the art of analogies.

You can't take someone from confusion mode to hype mode.

Hype statement:

* **Your coins shape the future.**

vs.

Dropping a knowledge bomb that kills all interest:

* **So there are these things called tickets...**

If you find yourself uttering those words you've already lost the battle, you may spend the next 40 minutes upsetting someone while you attempt to explain the target ticket pool size.

_Spoiler: They're not going to run and go buy some tickets once you're done with them, they will avoid you in the future though._

More examples of hype statements:

* **Coin holders are king.**

_Owning coins confer powers upon their holder._

* **If you don't know who's in charge then it's not you.**

_I don't think there's a single cryptocurrency out there that doesn't claim decentralization, the word is now meaningless.  You're either the captain of the ship or you're cargo._

Each of us can come up with unique hype statements that describe a facet of Decred.  Even the worst one will be compelling to some extent if constructed properly.

And we need the same approach when explaining the fundamentals of our technology, the details need to be ignored, we need to relate to things people know, these anchors will build confidence and spark intellectual curiosity.

Example:

* **Upgrade or be replaced.**

One of the better analogies I can present to regular people that makes Decred click is the example of how bolting things on as you go and adding technical debt leads to something like a video player that can play 8mm film, VHS, Betamax, Laserdisc, DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray.  Imagine if your product could never advance without guaranteeing it was backward compatible with any format you threw at it, who would buy it? What would it cost to build that, maintain it, who would want to work on that monstrosity and fix bugs in it? It wouldn't be acceptable to sell a machine like that for entertainment, would you let such a mess handle your money?

_If a money protocol can't upgrade cleanly it will get clunky and eventually be replaced._

## Who, what, where, when, and why you despicable monster?!?
None of this is glamorous work, it doesn't allow us to exhibit the full extent of our sophistication and technological prowess, however, it's tackling the barrier to Decred being more approachable.  The changes don't need to happen in one fell swoop, and there's no need for them to be created by a committee or have a budget.  It's a creative process that we need to encourage.

We can start by experimenting with simple alternative taglines and slowly weeding out the _bad_ words, replacing them with clearer alternatives when we create new content and better explainers.

The proliferation of competing Decred sites might end up obviating a lot of the need for changes to the "main site", maybe it should stay the way it is and as the community creates a bunch of new funnels which use different messaging, the market can decide.  It can then proliferate upstream once it's battle-tested.

TL;DR Consider if it's worthwhile to bless new messaging, we have bigger issues to tackle, and our current approach may be more alienating than it is informative at this point.
