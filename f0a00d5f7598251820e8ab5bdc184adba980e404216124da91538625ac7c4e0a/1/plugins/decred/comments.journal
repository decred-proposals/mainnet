And more clear message for the people that don't know what is Decred.\n\n3) In the Fair description, \n\n\"Decred is governed by its stakeholders, who time-lock some of their decentralized credits in exchange for tickets, using these to vote and make decisions about the Decred network and DCR asset's future.\"\n\nWould be great to let the people know that by time-locking their DCR, they will get income from the mining reward because of their vote and getting involve with the community.\n\n\nThe idea is to send a clear and complete message right from the beginning, just by looking at the main page of decred.org\n\nJust my 3 atoms, have a great day!","signature":"172848ad7acf4d8e5f70b87bec2ab0e72e3b64d72e75ffd94fb137eee16e90e42c39a1775178e81287cd97f7de06b960ae621f09bcf8bf67bbb55edb0d4a3a0a","publickey":"4882090741e997bb095bd0fd06fe66c89e0f6fe0b41cc787defebd000227ed78","commentid":"1","receipt":"2aca9026db6eb97795ab548bc934c9891452eabb348806ced1ee527703836329d2ce3d47d2ec5aa2571908686a810202408884bfb146957a8927c8148a8d100e","timestamp":1600883874,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Adaptable. Sustainable.\" for two reasons:\n\n1.  The word \"fair\" is too much of a loaded word.\n2.  Three items in the tagline should be the maximum.  The rule of three is an established principle in writing and advertising that should not be violated.  Three is catchy.  Four is excessive.","signature":"0d6a95c7fbe4909324dbd8d142582c5090212410cd59eacb1db5ca1f6079c2d21907882e167e40859c8895cbdfd8148370d5c25f9b6453e24722138f7799fa09","publickey":"758a6c7efbcc7b1d9f21849e6067d93332c5a4afac7891edc9d93e628d9862f8","commentid":"2","receipt":"58266576284419ca60b7964f769c3ffb6656581777447429e21602f6042766103224dfe396c5351cffa56aeb6126227620a4bcd01570241d6674928a5ed3ef04","timestamp":1600889152,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
