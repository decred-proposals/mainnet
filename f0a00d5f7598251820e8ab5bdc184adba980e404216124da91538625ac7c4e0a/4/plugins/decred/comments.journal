I agree that the existing website can use an update, and using the RFP system on Politeia to do so was an excellent idea.\n\n\"Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money for a Fairer Financial System\" is indeed a slight improvement to the existing copy, but it doesn't inspire me. It doesn't excite me about the project. It feels like you are trying to describe Decred, but using the wrong words.\n\nMy main points of criticism:\n\n1. Every crypto project is governed by stakeholders. Think about it. Especially when using a wide definition of the term stakeholder: benevolent dictators and three letter agencies are also considered stakeholders. This doesn't make Decred stand out among other projects. The defining characteristic is HOW the project is governed, which is something to explain when people are already warmed up (not in the first line). \n2. I had to search for a definition of sound money. It is not a familiar concept, I don't think this term will resonate with newcomers. IF you take the time to search for definitions via duckduckgo, it says: \"*Sound money is money that is not prone to sudden appreciation or depreciation in purchasing power over the long term*\" and \"*money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value : stable money*\". It seems the word \"sound\" does not really apply to DCR in this definition, because the price at which DCR was valued has changed significantly over the last few years.\n3. The suggested messaging also prominently mentions \"fairness\" which is a questionable word choice. The question \"fair for whom?\" is relevant here, because \"fairness\" is subjective. Decred voting is controlled by early adopters who bought DCR at a low price, this may feel unfair for people who join later. The price of DCR may go down, which will feel unfair to those who bought in at higher prices. Whether it is fairer than the current system really depends on your personal experience. \n\nAll in all, it seems the suggested messaging is aimed at people who already understand the project and its fundamentals. If the aim is to strengthen the existing community it may be the right move to pass this proposal. However, I think the homepage should address newcomers as well. Otherwise it will be difficult to grow Decred beyond the DCR bubble.\n\nTo remain constructive, I am collecting alternatives [in this post](https://github.com/noahpierau/articles/blob/master/decred-messaging-proposal.md). Feel free to open a pull-request or message me with your ideas.","signature":"7f5663d7ee1de352f2c7c957dbeb4b6c2ec19818e9f6673edcd978234e4a6b600b1e5e40f88434e7f9d09ab78ebe0e0b51d9c5599e012cb1fbcffcb6f1b2c10c","publickey":"62bfae59f14200726edce2ad6e75d0e9190307b23442e99b0cba78a84fdad4c8","commentid":"16","receipt":"e349742d86b827dea1c8bb5c1d9c37b39f720ae21f5426f35e9a89d421976335fe94f7dce1421d5ace99fddf1251117e0db4ad23c14223c0805c6ad23bc30d08","timestamp":1601033257,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I'm happy to go with something like \"Money Evolved\" as the tagline.\n\n\u003e Decred voting is controlled by early adopters who bought DCR at a low price, this may feel unfair for people who join later. \n\nThat's a fairly negative way to put it, because people who bought DCR early at a low price got no voting power unless they staked it, and only maintained their voting power if they kept staking and didn't sell (despite periods of significant price appreciation). If you have some numbers for this level of control please share them, because I've been working on this kind of question and I'm finding it quite difficult to quantify precisely. In any case, as long as everyone followed the rules, which we can be well assured that they did because of the blockchain records, their relative level of influence now after 4.5 years can be reasonably approximated to be \"fair enough\", imo.\n\nI agree that \"fair\" is a controversial term, but I think it's one that Decred can reasonably lay claim to, for the reasons outlined in the page copy. For me it's fair because it operates on clearly communicated rules that are the same for everyone. I'm not expecting to get rug-pulled or for the network to develop in a direction that's not aligned with the majority of stakeholders' wishes. The price doesn't have to go up for the network to operate fairly, the proposition is that stakeholders demonstrate their skin in the game and suffer (or enjoy) the consequences of their decisions in terms of the value of DCR. I don't see how it could be a \"fair game\" if it can guarantee price appreciation.","signature":"46e9d261dce7e64081e4e361fdc435ef1835e58fa668f1ef117672727f1aa7ee20febce37e92523b1246ac2ec08a60ad858bc15fb1297aef1debdf463f49860c","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"18","receipt":"43d00774596167bd3ad6fa79f6f2817636756ac9682501a4f0b006a0daae1c10862a8bdba10ede6d17228a0594ba7d60df14a091713ad0f1105473612180ce0e","timestamp":1601487973,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
