Invoice PR/HR/Marketing for Decred 2016/2017/2018

## What?

In this proposal I will provide as much information to cover the expenses of what relates to my work at Decred for the years 2016, 2017 until early 2018.

I do so to end this long waiting period since I gave my personal details to the lead project early 2017 as a contractor but never got paid as expected because of a misunderstanding. This will be the invoice.

In 2017 most of the team members/marketers were paid.

### Achievements:


In late 2015 I noticed [this article](https://cointelegraph.com/news/decred-an-innovative-cryptocurrency-or-a-well-arranged-scam) from CoinTelegraph and soon started bringing awareness about it on social media.

- Marketing

-Worldwide approach via Twitter/Facebook/Bct/Steemit since early 2016 until early 2018.

-Early FB [post](https://www.facebook.com/Aspasius/posts/477058815814318).

-[Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Decredcash) that was merged from another Decred page (started earlier in 2016) to regroup the followers. I used it to share posts on various Bitcoin/Blockchain groups on FB and some paid adds while actively sharing on my FB [personal account](https://www.facebook.com/Aspasius).

Here some stats of 2017 for the FB page: 

~ 2500 followers 

~200000 impressions

+1000 posts

-Actively sharing on [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1290358.0) in 2017 and showing the Decred banner on my [account](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=643310;sa=summary):

-Payment of articles published on private newsletters (5dcr/$150) [Atlcoinreviews](https://altcoinreviews.tumblr.com/post/165064333993/lets-start-with-some-minor-technical-details).

-Payment of the Facebook team (Liz: Spanish, Insaf: Arabic, Arnel: Filipino, Fabien: French) for reaching their targets (translation in sub-groups of the content produced in Decred DAO) and promoting Decred in their own language: French, Filipino, Arabic, Spanish (~100dcr/$2500 which are not included in this proposal).

-Constant airdrops in 2016 to attract new community members, 100s of new members to name a few: Darren, Clement, Rajan, Charles, Cedric, Oydi, Tom, Alessendro, Fabien, John, Sommer, Lauren, Mark, Philippe, Andrew, Liz, Chiu, Viraj, Bryce, Oliver, Arnel, Kenneth, Insaf, Nick, Ayush (~2000dcr/$3000 which are not included in this proposal).

- HR

-Finding workforce on social media (translators, developers, marketers, miners, investors, reporters).

-Community management by handling requests from messenger (support to new comers for buying dcr, installing and running the Decred software), FB posts (100% responsive rate) and on Decred Slack doing an admin job (welcoming new comers, answering questions).

-Down payments for several translations to ease the mood on Decred Slack in 2017. They all were waiting for the payment of the translation that was being reviewed and so for months. I can't recall the language of all of those who were paid by me (~100dcr/$2500 which are not included in this proposal). I did it as human resources management and some have been contractors at Decred since then.

- PR:

-Reaching the Bitcoin community members via FB to spread the word about Decred to cite only a few: (Craig Geswindt, Marc De Mesel, Roger Ver, Jeff Berwick, Logan Ryan Golema, Jason Cassidy).

  "Marc was an early Decred/Bitcoin investor
  
  Logan is a Bitcoin pioneer which invested in Decred later on
  
  Jason is well known in the cryptocurrency world and got involved into Decred
  
  Craig is mining Bitcoin/Decred actively"

-Contacting exchanges for listings (Private conversations discussed in Decred Slack afterward with the team members. The living Room of Satoshi, BTC-Alpha).

-Getting influencers to include Decred in their reports to mention one: Ken Bosack... (He got tattooed Decred on his forearm when I was heavily promoting Decred on Facebook), podcast arranged to mention one: [Adam the Bitcoin Meister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428acb4jwBM&feature=share).

-Lobbying in Australia (Jewelries, small and large businesses).

## Why?

Being part of the Decred community since the early stages, I have spent countless hours building the Facebook Page [Decred DAO](https://www.facebook.com/Decredcash) and the Decred Slack with my fellow community members while being part of the Decred team members as well as being active on the Bitcointalk Decred thread, Decred forum and Twitter. I never received any payments from the treasury which was handled by the DHG fund at the time.

The team members were paid at a rate of ~$300/week early 2017.

Politeia seems the way for me to make my request, as it is 100% transparent and every voice of the community count in it.

## How?

Work done on a weekly basis for more than 2 years:

* Content creation (see [Decred DAO](https://www.facebook.com/Decredcash)).

**2h...   | $35/h** | Total:$70

* Public relation (See the above PR).

**1h...   | $35/h** | Total:$35

* Community management and Human resources (See the above HR).

**6.5h | $30/h** | Total:$195

## Who?

**Aspasioz** on Slack, Decred Forum.

Most know me for the help provided early on FB in 2016 and latter on the Decred Slack in 2017.

## When?

Having provided those services and having a track record for those efforts I will request a payment for the work done prior.

## Costs

I will ask 380h or 40 weeks and charge $300/week for it.

A total of 9.5h/week of work provided for Decred during 2017 and early 2018 (10h/week maximum claimable in 2017 as mentioned by the project lead back then) in PR/HR/Community management.
