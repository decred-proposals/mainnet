As anyone who has been following the project for the past couple years or more is aware, our history with alexsolo is storied.  I will recount the summary of our interactions to give context to the less informed, and, after reading this, it should be clear why I am very much opposed to compensating alexsolo in any way.\n\nThe user alexsolo here was known as Alexoz on our [long-defunct forum](https://forum.decred.org), and he has been following the project since before its launch in Feb 2016.  During 2017, one of our contractors invited alexoz to the contractor chat without any prior discussion, and it became clear in short order that alexoz was either unwilling or unable to complete meaningful work for the project.  At no point did we tell him or otherwise give the impression he would be paid for work apart from work he explicitly invoiced for, which must be itemized.  Despite giving him an opportunity to contribute as a contractor, he never billed and was never able to meaningfully collaborate with any other contractor.  Once it was clear he was a bad fit as a contractor, we removed him from the contractor chat and ended the relationship.\n\nAt this point, he became incredibly irate and began to actively disparage the project publicly on social media and anywhere else he could.  This went on for roughly 2 years and then slowed down in late 2019.  Since I was not the one who originally invited him to be a contractor, I have been stuck in the unenviable position of dealing with a problem someone else created several years ago.  It was never my intent to bring him in as a contractor in the first place, so terminating the relationship was simply a matter of acting to protect the project.\n\nMost of alexoz’s negative behavior has already been outlined by other commenters, so I will not dwell on it.  The activities alexoz engaged in for which he is seeking repayment were neither approved by project contractors nor did they, to the best of my knowledge, meaningfully contribute to the project.  In light of the 2+ years of disparagement the project has experienced, if anything, alexoz should have to pay the project for the bad publicity he generated.\n\nIt is an awful idea to pay alexoz, considering his history with the project, and I strongly recommend stakeholders vote against this proposal.","signature":"81bc462b9f7b8b8e109589c85daddcaeeb1668d595a60bb52428e2b45c6575b839d7ceddc1b7e67fa36d39a70c6a367c45830e6cc10efd16f533e22fa1e4380e","publickey":"e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","commentid":"48","receipt":"9ea5d56b7ad3a8e82c90249946a2e26949de6884898eeb149a566ae6a36b8cf4594e836319b9e820bd190419c9d013b8459997b986b08a21440c1a9e9a243b06","timestamp":1601247804,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I never spoke negatively about the project in 2017. Only after the ban from a decentralised project promoting freespeech and I wasn't the first (traders got banned calling the top in April 2017).\n\nI was selling Decred at 5% off the market price to attract investors (which are still holding since 2016/2017) how is that different from analysts using complex language (which is currently being discussed  in [this proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4532397)) getting little impact on the market.\n\nAll the support brought to the community in 2016/2017.\n\nMore than 14h per day talking non-stop about Decred getting the attention on social media apparently had no value in the eyes of the few launching this project.\n\nPositive things are team members that heard about Decred via myself, podcasters/reporters, investors, marketers, developers. The list is long and I've received a lot of criticism by Bitcoin maximalists on Bitcoin groups in 2016 whose are openly promoting Decred  now.","signature":"b645ed612fd6d3b201ed225a7aca58d800e88f06bba0726f124ea179383771110c500bc996bb4f0e334e46218fc56754b9ed5f1e825cc0d11d0651dca98efb04","publickey":"c02dfd733bcca10c5cd774e97f8e5b8611ae86dafd58313ef30a6476d48f1aa4","commentid":"51","receipt":"6bfbaf6dd988427a74f32e5cb2625986d24ba77963cd85b7dafd3ac4095e48425459821832589a9729798b865c47e0fadc5692402cce9e8e6c03be82f4809b06","timestamp":1601278984,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Anymore questions?\n\nI'd just like to add that I've been working hard for +2 years at Decred. Never really found any team members doing marketing during the first year and was too busy taking care of the [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/Decredcash) in 2017 but managed to do a french translation, help some members building Decred websites and basically do an admin job on the general Slack. I've spent most of my time talking about Decred to private investors, attracting new members (this job is apparently not valuable in the eyes of the community). Caring about the members I brought in this game cost me my place as a \"valuable\" member of the Decred community. \n\nToday, I still receive requests about Decred as an investment by dm, email from strangers on the internet.","signature":"ce2b3febf7934d2cddbf34e3cd36ff8541305653199f5e78228170b63fdb1a1b771fde266f302dc435325e9fcb6a127e9771c22b4ad93e17efb76129893f8c0d","publickey":"c02dfd733bcca10c5cd774e97f8e5b8611ae86dafd58313ef30a6476d48f1aa4","commentid":"54","receipt":"248bb97b337e97693c29c0b967d353a4320c97e5012bcd526ca41ac85f0fb813344af373049c51c5c5b779e21be87b35cb8e6e0169499d8309cc7682e1ed2309","timestamp":1601363432,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
