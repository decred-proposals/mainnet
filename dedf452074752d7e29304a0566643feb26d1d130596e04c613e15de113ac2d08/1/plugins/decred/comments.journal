Although I believe your heart to be in the right place with wanting to contribute to Decred in this particular area, I find your proposal to be quite lacking in details for the steep price point of $1500 per piece.\n\nFirst of all, would you mind explaining how you see these posters contributing to growing the Decred brand and overall awareness? What are the advantages over the conventional Decred-inspired art/graphics?\nWhile I see *some* of the appeal of such art at conferences, unless we all start walking around with AR glasses soon I think this is a very narrow niche that you're seeking to fill, and the novelty factor itself does not appear to justify the expense.\n\nSecondly, you know it is customary for all contributors to provide a kind of proof-of-work and ability to deliver before taking on a proposal-sized task, so could you remind us of your existing contributions to Decred in order to establish your creative track record within the project?\n\nLooking forward to your reply :)","signature":"2ba79d26cc80c4fd6dfff8693fd99b9d588f00e19a658a42766fd91fe79d7d172f2bb4d624883620a1160c5c515bc6c27cc999b2807a7110391e60bf7a112607","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"2","receipt":"1f38d66e321e1a19e6b4b7c4430811fda9c68579965b2bb307e44773f523a80e71079c1c01cb7b191ea37ca689ff62b75cecbdfc6b0d920e69f9af0f0e89b00c","timestamp":1594923185,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Neither that or just an act of producing design artifacts for producing them isn't passable reason for funding. Any proposed work needs to be driven by serving and benefiting DCR first and foremost.\n\n15k ask is frankly out of proportion for those reasons and without anything to show. Ie. to put it in perspective, Politeia hackathon at Texas uni had a prize pool of 5k (+ some org costs), with a practical reason of bringing a bunch of fresh dev and use case concepts to the table, as well promoting the project for new grads to get involved with. \n\nAgree with kozel on AR being too niche and that just a poster would not be practical at a conference. But perhaps that makes for a discussion point to think of creative ways to innovate the DCR's conference presentation and booth game. Its somewhat of a waste imo, that there's a bunch of printed matter produced for confs. in comparison to on screen stuff – where-as Decred is digital in nature. \n\nMy recommendation is to look for common ground with some larger marketing initiative what has practical need for visual comms, and would benefit from working with specific production stack or thinking. And experienced contributors to collaborate with, who are able to provide solid direction and help that ensure whatever is made serves a purpose. Expectation to work off community feedback in a slack channel (don’t even think there is a decred slack any more) won’t bring any good outcome unfortunately. \n\nAnd as always with design work in proposals, a portfolio is something expected as that's a way to review ones track record.

I have just written about it while replying to kozel's comment.\n\nRegarding the steep price I'm afraid I must disagree. Please note that the offer is $1500 for each poster, while the agreement can be cancelled at any time. It means that 15k budget scenario is only possible after 10 months, if all 10 posters will be delivered. Essentially, in case if after the first poster you will say \"we like it, please make another one\" and you will continue to do so 9 times.\n\nI agree that $1500 for just \"a poster\" would be a steep price, but Augmented Reality version is a different thing. It must be either animated, or at least done in 3D to make it interesting. In my personal opinion this price is fair not only in the US, but even here in Poland where I live.\n\nWhether it will be practical or not at a conference, I won't argue with that (I'm honestly not sure).

I tried out one of the apps in the sample pdf and to be honest I am not that impressed, it seems like a gimmick to look at these on a phone pointed at a computer screen. I am also not keen on the requirement to download apps to view these posters, and I think this will limit the number of people who see them as they are intended.\n\nI am not impressed with the samples but maybe you plan to produce something better than these, it's hard to envision what quality the posters you produce would be. In any case I don't think there is need for 10 of them at $1,500 each, that seems like a big commitment up front without knowing what to expect.\n\nConsidering the audience for these augmented reality posters is probably quite niche, it's worth considering whether that is an audience Decred is particularly relevant for. \n\nIn my view it would be more interesting to situate Decred posters or other artworks within virtual worlds in places where they will be seen by more people, and hopefully people who are receptive to hearing about Decred. It is often assumed that a good familiarity with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin/Ethereum is a prerequisite for getting the point of Decred - so maybe a placement in a virtual world like Decentraland (which also has a kind of token governance) or similar would be more interesting than going to the users of these AR apps.","signature":"fa571839f495e639823ac257034a3cfcad536b51650a883e8c53be26654ba3152aa9b34a32a5ba4b4d2d83e7f288bb7efdfc09eea3a62a118df081a498995802","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"7","receipt":"d7bb13f7817177ccacdefd5ce07e4a698cbc8431df7b7ebd6f529bc4a66592962fcaf4856d365b7f140cef960bd149d8cf8029926fe08e34b365901e6d552200","timestamp":1595105054,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It's nice to see a proposal that ventures in a more creative direction.\n\nAR has exciting applications however the tools to create these posters is fairly ubiquitous (you detail the software needed), so really it's the creative execution that matters and is what makes $1500 / poster either cheap or relatively expensive. \n\nFor the benefit of stakeholders, the market price for a good 3D designer is $300-600 per day, at least that's what we generally work to.  \n\nSo splitting the difference, each poster constitutes c.3 days work - is this close to your estimate? I know there are two people so perhaps your rate is lower. \n\nOnce you've created and rendered the layers, the process to turn them into AR is automated through Artvive. I'm assuming you are including the cost of a [subscription](https://artivive.com/pricing/) in your proposal - you don't provide detail as to which package, that would be useful.\n\nAre you are expecting the community to come up with the concepts in the #posters channel that you will then bring to life? \n\nI think for the price you've quoted it would be good to see an example DCR poster - ideally an original concept, but failing that, one based on an existing DCR poster.\n\nMy main concern is that these posters will exist in isolation rather than as part of a more cohesive strategy, where they are just one element within a broader plan. \n\nI have a thoughts on this so feel free to drop me a [message](https://twitter.com/monsieurbulb), rather than clog up the comments here. \n\n\n\n\n\n","signature":"94904fa76593fa3f0d1441c6f6e5d515bf80637c48884a892765519e06fe10e0a8a96f1fcad6eefbd0550447817f70da213bdb75e25b9a2df7a2958e7c5e6f08","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"8","receipt":"82b086a8e0a17d0c444f2f45e64c10e4b5456d77997265e4153321b007fe59ba51dcea6a8b1695767e326b60d74e81ce1b20de42de8edfd1ed00dcd4e9e44800","timestamp":1595163394,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It is often assumed that a good familiarity with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin/Ethereum is a prerequisite for getting the point of Decred - so maybe a placement in a virtual world like Decentraland (which also has a kind of token governance) or similar would be more interesting than going to the users of these AR apps.\n\nI agree with this sentiment however I think there are some interesting phases that could come before Decentraland and Cryptovoxels which are very very early.\n\nIf you haven't checked out https://async.art/ before, this feels far more interesting as a space. \n\nProgrammable and upgradeable art is uniquely enabled by crypto and is far more in keeping with Decred's 'adaptable' nature so there is a natural link to a project capability. \n\nExample: take a feed of Decred on-chain data and link that to a piece of art. Pablito has [experimented](https://twitter.com/plabarta_/status/1221450735545733122?s=20) in this space already and this feels like an interesting direction with lots of potential... it is however a different idea. \n","signature":"e9e3b8a58469a5d2f1319b086d4c37b1d549809e3d79864b8f80c97f71eb26e3fbcf6c08880b113dc6178b4e5eb2ed64379ac5b7df8aa6d5b658f301eeb9970a","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"11","receipt":"7760b361c6a5f30705d1095fa3d99d2e6f7d03698f2026cbe44f5b1878a158e48cad0432759cc40287a5fc6faeb1fe07ceecd3a6a20106941fd83c8ad482c80a","timestamp":1595164170,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Also congratulations on your recent graduation from PJA.\n\n**A few red flags:**\n\n- There is limited previously produced output. \n- There is no reference to the effectiveness of the output.\n- There is a reliance on proprietary 3rd Party Software. \n\n*Additionally:*\n\n- Cancellation clause, further clarification is required here. \n- Many of the other points worth raising have already been discussed elsewhere.\n\n**Summary:**\nWhilst I admire the ambition here I think writing a proposal to \"fund your portfolio\" isn't the way to actually achieve paid work for the project.  In my opinion, a much more effective way of achieving this would be clarifying  \"What does the project actually need?\" and working on a proposal that provides a solution. \n\nLook forward to the opportunity to vote \"Yes\" on a future proposal, however.

Each poster can be printed and framed.\n\nI am not denying their use, but am curious as to what advantages they have over the conventional materials that can be used for promotional purposes, especially given the price point.\nI also concur with points made elsewhere that this could work as part of a larger plan, and unless there is one then creating such expensive deliverables to be available \"just in case\" does not sit well with me.\n\n\u003e I think it's important to note that Augmented Reality posters do not require AR glasses. Only mobile phone is needed. I encourage you to review the PDF that I have included and try the examples. Me and Sylwia are authors of all the Augmented Reality graphics in that PDF.\n\nYes, I am aware of that, but you have to agree that having one's phone out and looking at the word as if it were a huge game of Pokemon GO is just not going to happen anytime soon. I did indeed have a look at the document and example provided within, and as far as paying $1500 per piece I am not impressed, especially since it does not showcase the quality of material that would be delivered to the project.\n\n\u003e Regarding my personal contribution to Decred, I was the original creator of Decred PL twitter but I have handed over the keys while I was busy studying :-)\n\nYes, I am well aware, but what is your experience in providing deliverables to the project from within the domain that you're trying to apply your skills to? \nJust because one shows initiative in one area does not mean they will automatically gain the support necessary to provide work in area they have not proven themselves to be experienced or capable in, like I doubt anyone would take a marketing contributor seriously if they wanted to start billing for development work without providing acceptable work product first.\n\nBesides that, you mentioned that you and Sylwia were going to be the duo behind this proposal, but as far as the Decred community is concerned she is a complete unknown. This is potentially problematic because, as far as I know,  each contributor needs to have their ability to provide meaningful work assessed individually in order to be issued a contractor clearance. Has she done any work for the project or can you expand on her relationship with Decred?\n\nMoreover, an important point mentioned elsewhere is the cancellation clause. You say that production of new posters can be cancelled at any time, butwithout putting it up for a vote, which makes use of stakeholder attention, there is no way to reliably determine that, which makes me think that although it sounds like an easy way out, the reality of it is much the opposite.\n\n\n","signature":"8ca8d3b0f390faf4b96940c5fb7c0bcd08c0afb4cf2cdf0a28ecbfad7abf13733beca06f9570095726e685bbe7273d07b8a2879106d40d7c61cd643fa81af30a","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"13","receipt":"653270f5f66e7398a51e1d82aab717a1af6bb47263fc9936d34e20facb98766bea255b2bd367fe59f4150637b2307b87723b8ce0e9cebea18a2de3182d9a6008","timestamp":1595269317,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
