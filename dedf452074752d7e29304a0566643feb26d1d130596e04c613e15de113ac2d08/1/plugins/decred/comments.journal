Although I believe your heart to be in the right place with wanting to contribute to Decred in this particular area, I find your proposal to be quite lacking in details for the steep price point of $1500 per piece.\n\nFirst of all, would you mind explaining how you see these posters contributing to growing the Decred brand and overall awareness? What are the advantages over the conventional Decred-inspired art/graphics?\nWhile I see *some* of the appeal of such art at conferences, unless we all start walking around with AR glasses soon I think this is a very narrow niche that you're seeking to fill, and the novelty factor itself does not appear to justify the expense.\n\nSecondly, you know it is customary for all contributors to provide a kind of proof-of-work and ability to deliver before taking on a proposal-sized task, so could you remind us of your existing contributions to Decred in order to establish your creative track record within the project?\n\nLooking forward to your reply :)","signature":"2ba79d26cc80c4fd6dfff8693fd99b9d588f00e19a658a42766fd91fe79d7d172f2bb4d624883620a1160c5c515bc6c27cc999b2807a7110391e60bf7a112607","publickey":"49912d8dd296ce00a4b6afce4f300481ed5403142740e8b510276dccd1cbaccd","commentid":"2","receipt":"1f38d66e321e1a19e6b4b7c4430811fda9c68579965b2bb307e44773f523a80e71079c1c01cb7b191ea37ca689ff62b75cecbdfc6b0d920e69f9af0f0e89b00c","timestamp":1594923185,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Neither that or just an act of producing design artifacts for producing them isn't passable reason for funding. Any proposed work needs to be driven by serving and benefiting DCR first and foremost.\n\n15k ask is frankly out of proportion for those reasons and without anything to show. Ie. to put it in perspective, Politeia hackathon at Texas uni had a prize pool of 5k (+ some org costs), with a practical reason of bringing a bunch of fresh dev and use case concepts to the table, as well promoting the project for new grads to get involved with. \n\nAgree with kozel on AR being too niche and that just a poster would not be practical at a conference. But perhaps that makes for a discussion point to think of creative ways to innovate the DCR's conference presentation and booth game. Its somewhat of a waste imo, that there's a bunch of printed matter produced for confs. in comparison to on screen stuff – where-as Decred is digital in nature. \n\nMy recommendation is to look for common ground with some larger marketing initiative what has practical need for visual comms, and would benefit from working with specific production stack or thinking. And experienced contributors to collaborate with, who are able to provide solid direction and help that ensure whatever is made serves a purpose. Expectation to work off community feedback in a slack channel (don’t even think there is a decred slack any more) won’t bring any good outcome unfortunately. \n\nAnd as always with design work in proposals, a portfolio is something expected as that's a way to review ones track record.

I really wanted to encourage discussion while keeping the original proposal as simple as possible.\n\nAugmented Reality posters can contribute in the following two areas:\n\n1) marketing materials (same group as regular posters, stickers, animations, etc.) to be used online, or at conferences.\n\n2) Fan art. Each poster can be printed and framed.\n\nI think it's important to note that Augmented Reality posters **do not require AR glasses**. Only mobile phone is needed. I encourage you to review [the PDF](http://www.users.pjwstk.edu.pl/~s2946/decred.pdf) that I have included and try the examples. Me and Sylwia are authors of all the Augmented Reality graphics in that PDF.\n\nRegarding my personal contribution to Decred, I was the original creator of [Decred PL](https://twitter.com/decred_pl) twitter but I have handed over the keys while I was busy studying :-)\n","signature":"0df0638bb9dda45a637dcbece8647f795cfffc4add6c299e1b324aea4a48f13819afa202344bbe786af454a13e58186bd6ab767bb0fae61f48e41c703215c303","publickey":"807d88a51cfaf8b65413cb66cba02f1d32bf6a8fba83883455caf6cde621bde6","commentid":"4","receipt":"b2db3fcf68766e2acdc429f96187f739fd6365365fcce21c76de27f4c138061eefa80ecee89b5e50d918aa6afafe1cae026474bcf5f8b899fb2da49f7eeb710b","timestamp":1595065087,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I have just written about it while replying to kozel's comment.\n\nRegarding the steep price I'm afraid I must disagree. Please note that the offer is $1500 for each poster, while the agreement can be cancelled at any time. It means that 15k budget scenario is only possible after 10 months, if all 10 posters will be delivered. Essentially, in case if after the first poster you will say \"we like it, please make another one\" and you will continue to do so 9 times.\n\nI agree that $1500 for just \"a poster\" would be a steep price, but Augmented Reality version is a different thing. It must be either animated, or at least done in 3D to make it interesting. In my personal opinion this price is fair not only in the US, but even here in Poland where I live.\n\nWhether it will be practical or not at a conference, I won't argue with that (I'm honestly not sure).
