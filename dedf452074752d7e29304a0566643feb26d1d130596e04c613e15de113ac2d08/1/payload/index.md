Augmented Reality posters

**What**

A set of 10 Augmented Reality posters for Decred.

Augmented Reality poster is just a regular poster that can be viewed using mobile device. To see some examples, please check [this PDF guide](http://www.users.pjwstk.edu.pl/~s2946/decred.pdf).

**Why**

We would like to expand our portfolio and make something nice for Decred.

**How**

We will be using tools that we know very well and that are most commonly used for this kind of art. Affinity Designer and/or Adobe Illustrator for 2D graphics, Adobe After Effects and Premiere for animation. Photoshop whenever needed and Cinema 4D for 3D if necessary. We will be using Zappar and Artivive for AR but we are also familiar with Adobe Aero and Torch.

For the entire process we will be available on Slack (we can create a separate #posters channel) and listen to the community feedback.

We would like to request a fee of $1500 for each poster. The agreement can be cancelled at any time. That makes a maximum total budget of $15000 (for 10 completed posters).

**Who**

Mission (me) and Sylwia. Sylwia is my academy colleague, and you should know me from Slack. I’m a long-term Decred hodler since 2017. I have invested in BTC in 2013 (via Mt.Gox :) and I have transferred all my funds to Decred (I don’t diversify) when I’ve discovered Decred and the fact that it was made by Conformal Systems.

Both Sylwia and me are recent graduates of New Media Arts at [https://www.pja.edu.pl/en](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en).

**When**

We are ready to start immediately and we are planning to design 1 poster each month, for 10 successive months. You are free to cancel the agreement immediately if you will come to the conclusion that the delivered artwork is not meeting quality standards (or for whatever other reason).
