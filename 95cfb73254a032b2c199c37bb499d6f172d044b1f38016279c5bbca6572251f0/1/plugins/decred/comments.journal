This adds value and can increase adoption.   It's this kind of video content that the average user stumbles upon via YouTube Recommendations, and this can boost adoption, and it can also help existing DCR users get a quick rundown.\n\nProposal is well-written and I have no objection to any part of it!

I commented why on Reddit ([one](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cveuuu/the_feeless_decred_dex_has_been_approved/) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/dktucx/new_video_year_1_review_of_politeia_decreds/) [three](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/eq62t9/is_a_public_relations_firm_worth_it_decred/)) but in short: they are to the point, have no bloat, they value my time. Decred stakeholders are special kind of target audience whose time and attention span must be utilized as efficiently as possible.\n- These videos allow me to absorb a lot of updates in just a few minutes and get the big picture before I dive into details.\n- Growing YouTube presence is an [much needed step](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#grow-our-social-media) in our outreach. YouTube is an important target platform with huge potential.\n- Being funded by the stakeholders allows to avoid all the headaches of the unstable and selective YouTube monetization algorithms.\n- The pay is fair. To be honest, I'd like to see it increase and become a competitive job offer. I think so about all current contractors. My reasoning is that, in context of the huge goals Decred has, we have quite few committed and loyal builders/creators and we should pay them well.\n\nIdeas:\n\n- I would appreciate if you could put the final versions of scripts on GitHub. It will be of great help for searching (you can't reliably search videos by text yet), knowledge preservation and translations.\n- Put all links to referenced proposals/web pages/etc in the description to make it easy to follow up. Or even better, put a single link to script/sources file on GitHub to maintain them all from one place.\n- Create a few cryptocurrency-agnostic videos covering subjects highly relevant to Decred, e.g. an overview of governance models, PoW vs PoWPoS vs PoS, debunk energy usage myths, etc. This will help to attract new people researching the space. Knowing your quality I'm sure some viewers will associate \"Decred = high quality\" over time. I think limiting crypto-general videos to ~15% is reasonable, but it can be revised if that becomes a success.\n- Keep an eye on decentralized platforms competing with YouTube, for 3 reasons: 1) There have been issues with the \"YouTube algorithm\" and censorship; 2) If a better (hopefully decentralized) platform overtakes YouTube, we will be among the first content producers; 3) Decentralized project promoting other decentralized projects just makes sense.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- When making videos, do you have \"audio-only\" experience in mind (i.e. minimizing the loss of information when listening without video)? What are your thoughts?\n- Do you plan to disable ads/monetization for videos funded by the Treasury? Or will it be a choice of `decredchannel` owners?","signature":"6942727b524342e0b747dc667f88325ccd9ac5c0ba5bee2fb42f795f8dbb50748becb61f08c1ae4b7e002c1a11e1893f8bcfee1692cd27ccc55b34b4d6638f09","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"15","receipt":"e5ddf68ee8fecd142006f6f62fdbe4edf7e3e1e1a7210ef2614075fffa44edbb4b71d79db4eff1f87206f2eadd6db862e21bb85be97d5622e1a106f2a9417908","timestamp":1580668346,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

As a result this will make scheduling returning formats e.g. your Decred 101 (like the Dash education series) really important as a tentpole series that will engage existing users and work well for new arrivals - give it a simple and easy to access title for the series \"Decred 101\" and then make sure the title comes ahead and posits something that will draw the viewers curiosity, so \"Why Privacy Matters: Decred 101\" for example. Pick a time and a day and stick to it. Generally you want to upload so you catch first thing in the morning as people are getting up, lunchtime and evening. Sundays are a good day to upload longer, more in depth pieces, weekdays for more snackable stuff. Friday lunchtime is, Friday evening isn't. \n\nThis plays to a bigger point discussed in a previous [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/063e38270b475ad680e98c12d1a48e322f4e8defe40b265272ea60c6d2202b13/comments/19) around how Decred manages an overall content calendar - aligning contractors and community members around key events and media. \n\n*Keep Thumbnails Consistent*\n\nThe difference between a good thumbnail and a bad one can mean the difference between a video getting 100 views and 1000. That doesn't mean clickbait thumbs but it does mean consistent, clear, well signposted videos that draw the viewer in and ensure a clear visual language. YouTube rewards channels with high engagement metrics around things like 'watch time', so that is a good measure to look for in the analytics - if you get thumbs right, when people click they should stick around. There are a bunch of guides online and also YouTube have their own [playbook](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/features/youtube-playbook/) which is updated every year - its a good place to start for best practices on things like titles, humbnails and metatagging. \n\n- **Community**\n\nOn YouTube - as in the world - people follow people (or characters), so having returning 'faces' on the Decred YouTube channel is important. The 'Vlogging' format you've developed on your own channel is a YouTube staple and is ideal for this kind of relationship building, but don't forget that YouTube is also about community interaction. \n\nUse CTAs (Calls To Action) to prompt a response in the comments \"What worry's you about privacy... leave a comment below\" and then use these community comments as inspiration for new videos in another series - kind of a long running Decred Community AMA. There are lots of incredibly smart people in the community and crypto is a scary place for most newcomers. Ensuring that Decred has educational materials that are also interactive will be a strength when built up over time. \n\nDecred 101 can be your show on the basics of Decred, but there might be an equivalent of Decred In Depth podcast that might be a nice format to have guests on from the Decred contractor group. On YouTube the best channels are the ones where they work together with the fans and include them in the 'show'. This openness and inclusivity is core to building engagement over the long term. \n\n- **Collaboration**\nWith the volume of content uploaded to YouTube every day are only a few ways to reach viewers:\n\n**1. Search:** These are people who are already looking for content about Decred from the home page. For this audience it's all about Decred's YouTube channel being well organised, signposted and with clear and concise titles and thumbnails. \n\n**2. Embedded views:** This is when the video is embedded on an external site or publisher, or in social sites like Twitter or Facebook (though YouTube videos don't travel well on FB, their native video is best). There is a benefit to creating this Decred 101 as a trusted resource that smaller crypto publishers can start to pick up and embed over time. This means coordination with Monde PR - this is all about a long tail strategy rather than a big hit on major publications, but it can be effective if the strategy is sustained over a long period of time - which this proposal has the ability to do. Think about building a network of smaller publishers who are looking for educational materials. \n\n **3. Collaborations:** All of the big YouTubers built their success on collaborations with other YouTubers. On the platform the options are so vast, that discovery is the single hardest thing to achieve. This could be an opportunity for another ongoing series where you reach out to and build conversations with projects who have active communities but are in areas with adjacent interests to the tech  stack being built by Decred. Topics like Privacy, sub- cultures like Remote work, these are communities that will be interested not just in what Decred does, but how it might help them. It might be an interesting idea to plot these potential technical / cultural adjacencies and then reach out to those YouTube channels and suggest a collaboration (Bee [mentioned this](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html) at the end of his marketing strategies document). \n\nIn a collaboration, there are generally links from one channel to the other - often there is Part 1 on one channel and then Part 2 on the second channel and the aim is to share audience. So for instance a collaboration with a YT channel focussed on personal privacy features a conversation on their channel with you - the focus is on why privacy matters... the follow on video on Decred's YouTube channel features you and the presenter from the other channel discussing how Decred's privacy implementation works. \n \nFinal point which speaks to a more general strategy around YouTube. *Channels* is actually a misnomer since they really act more like *shows* - by this I mean that populating a single channel with **all** of the content about Decred means channels can become densely packed and hard to browse. Someone who came for Decred 101 might be scared off by really technical discussions around the DEX for example - it's all about profiling potential users and the purpose for their  visit and then building Decred as a *network* of channels under the same collective umbrella. Playlists help with this to a certain extent, but they also have their own limitations. Over time it would be good to see this network appear to enable specialism of individual *channels* that can better serve a specific need. \n\nGood luck.

For example, a video breaking down DCR's privacy would best be released alongside the actual release of privacy features in Decrediton to maximize interest/results. Same idea with the Lightning Network's release, the DEX, Research Articles, etc. We don't know exactly when these things are coming, so I don't want to trap myself by promising \"Videos A, B, and C will be released in month Y.\" when in that particular month there happens to be new releases/more important topics to cover. \n- Some things I come across sporadically and have the urge to turn into a video. For example, [this snippet of Marco talking about the Dex](https://youtu.be/TNcmLrSPMRc) from 2018 I came across, and found to be great (this is how it goes for most snippets). I will be closely monitoring all forth-coming DCR media to find the best bits, some months will have more, some will have less.\n- I don't know what Events looks like for this year, so I can't say for sure what videos will come from it.\n- I simply listed a sample of videos I thought would be good content for people to know about DCR. A few I have begun scripting in earnest. Some community members have already come up with interesting ideas of their own, and I'd hate not to act on their ideas simply because they weren't hard scheduled in.\n\nI have structured my proposal such that I am not receiving a fixed amount of funds every month, but rather I am billing hourly via CMS (with a hardcap in place). If fewer videos are delivered in a given month for whatever reason (e.g. it's summer, I happen to be on vacation for 2 weeks), then the treasury will simply not be billed.","signature":"adafc711ced1f575ffecb5983783449d206042282fd01cf5a43bd5f286c7fba462c7787a64677405f57aa89767a12821e830660c08c5958c8cdf79b4084f440f","publickey":"988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458","commentid":"21","receipt":"385bfb819d9291a1688eb60386f9f910195ad81e1d140c2d3649ce434934f2f2fac403378f4826dd5453929e8a90db3632a34e4a8f5def0ab3209c34e19f4004","timestamp":1580884992,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

It is exactly the reason as to why the Ditto work and recent proposal sat awkwardly for many since it felt like something that needed to be done (because that's what everyone does), but also something that was in direct conflict with the projects OSS values (which is definitely not what everyone does).  \n\nA case in point where things get messy without absolute clarity and transparency is the recently approved research proposals from [richardred](https://proposals.decred.org/user/350a4b6c-5cdd-4d87-822a-4900dc3a930c) and [checkmatey](https://proposals.decred.org/user/eb486ed6-bbb3-4815-9547-599cc0f28325). \n\nTrust takes a long time to build and a minute to destroy - especially in an area like crypto. I enjoyed [Crypto Commons ](https://cryptocommons.cc/) because it did feel like genuine independent analysis and thinking in the same way I enjoyed checkmatey's recent [bear case](https://t.co/k8j2JFonVA?amp=1) debate with [Vitalik](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ewb9as/why_eth_wont_sustain_a_monetary_premium/fg1q9q7/) about  ETH sustaining a monetary premium. \n\nI took them both at face value as independent analysts whose lack of bias was a reason to trust their output - their continued involvedment with Decred being a signal to me that this is a place that attracts a really smart and dedicated group, which in turn makes me confident of the projects long term success. \n\nWhere it gets messy from an outside perspective is when that role as independent researchers creating truly independent research products designed to make everyone smarter (public benefit), crosses over to being paid to research and analyse Decred's own data which are then used to provide the bull case for in investment in DCR.  The same applies with this video proposal. \n\nWhat are the lines? Where are they drawn? How is this communicated internally and externally? \n\nI don't claim to have the answer, but I do think it's an area that is worth more in depth conversation that crosses a wide range of perspectives. Bandaid solutions such as suggested above just serve to put off addressing the real issue which is something that has implications for literally everything the project does going forward. \n\nIf left unresolved it just makes the job of building trust around the projects values, products and research much harder. \n ","signature":"f941216f5da173f133e89565e0406aba84e6cd6d24621c2fcde308c8ec5ff6e25fc95588547a595ba56b162bce84d28dbdf31807d441558041de9a1b2ecaff0b","publickey":"e0b17a0e47a987c30451df36bea7237604b9adc022bf791dd8c12ce597757dc9","commentid":"22","receipt":"59428c1ae2df04ba18cc81bde882a5fba91f20e928e8999de212890b9622d56b59b75e970b9828e32aeeda8e348b12c09f168b79bd325d474e4cb553d21fa309","timestamp":1580897458,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
