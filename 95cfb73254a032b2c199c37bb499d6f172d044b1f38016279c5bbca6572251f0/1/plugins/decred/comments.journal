This adds value and can increase adoption.   It's this kind of video content that the average user stumbles upon via YouTube Recommendations, and this can boost adoption, and it can also help existing DCR users get a quick rundown.\n\nProposal is well-written and I have no objection to any part of it!

I commented why on Reddit ([one](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cveuuu/the_feeless_decred_dex_has_been_approved/) [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/dktucx/new_video_year_1_review_of_politeia_decreds/) [three](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/eq62t9/is_a_public_relations_firm_worth_it_decred/)) but in short: they are to the point, have no bloat, they value my time. Decred stakeholders are special kind of target audience whose time and attention span must be utilized as efficiently as possible.\n- These videos allow me to absorb a lot of updates in just a few minutes and get the big picture before I dive into details.\n- Growing YouTube presence is an [much needed step](https://xaur.github.io/writings/posts/20191127-marketing-strategies.html#grow-our-social-media) in our outreach. YouTube is an important target platform with huge potential.\n- Being funded by the stakeholders allows to avoid all the headaches of the unstable and selective YouTube monetization algorithms.\n- The pay is fair. To be honest, I'd like to see it increase and become a competitive job offer. I think so about all current contractors. My reasoning is that, in context of the huge goals Decred has, we have quite few committed and loyal builders/creators and we should pay them well.\n\nIdeas:\n\n- I would appreciate if you could put the final versions of scripts on GitHub. It will be of great help for searching (you can't reliably search videos by text yet), knowledge preservation and translations.\n- Put all links to referenced proposals/web pages/etc in the description to make it easy to follow up. Or even better, put a single link to script/sources file on GitHub to maintain them all from one place.\n- Create a few cryptocurrency-agnostic videos covering subjects highly relevant to Decred, e.g. an overview of governance models, PoW vs PoWPoS vs PoS, debunk energy usage myths, etc. This will help to attract new people researching the space. Knowing your quality I'm sure some viewers will associate \"Decred = high quality\" over time. I think limiting crypto-general videos to ~15% is reasonable, but it can be revised if that becomes a success.\n- Keep an eye on decentralized platforms competing with YouTube, for 3 reasons: 1) There have been issues with the \"YouTube algorithm\" and censorship; 2) If a better (hopefully decentralized) platform overtakes YouTube, we will be among the first content producers; 3) Decentralized project promoting other decentralized projects just makes sense.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- When making videos, do you have \"audio-only\" experience in mind (i.e. minimizing the loss of information when listening without video)? What are your thoughts?\n- Do you plan to disable ads/monetization for videos funded by the Treasury? Or will it be a choice of `decredchannel` owners?","signature":"6942727b524342e0b747dc667f88325ccd9ac5c0ba5bee2fb42f795f8dbb50748becb61f08c1ae4b7e002c1a11e1893f8bcfee1692cd27ccc55b34b4d6638f09","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"15","receipt":"e5ddf68ee8fecd142006f6f62fdbe4edf7e3e1e1a7210ef2614075fffa44edbb4b71d79db4eff1f87206f2eadd6db862e21bb85be97d5622e1a106f2a9417908","timestamp":1580668346,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

I will upload scripts to Github prior to completion for others to proof-read in order to achieve maximum accuracy. I hinted at this in the 'Who' section i.e inquiring with other contractors on certain content and suggestions.\n\n\u003e Put all links to referenced proposals/web pages/etc in the description to make it easy to follow up. \n\nYes, I will do this. I will also include time-stamps.\n\n\u003e Create a few cryptocurrency-agnostic videos covering subjects highly relevant to Decred\n\nI think this falls in line with some of the research RichardRed (and others) have done regarding the Governance of other projects. It would definitely be great to be turned into a video.\n\n\u003e When making videos, do you have \"audio-only\" experience in mind?\n\nYes. The scripts will be detailed and informative enough to where viewers listening only with audio should get a lot of it. Viewing with video will still be the ideal experience, of course.\n\n\u003e Do you plan to disable ads/monetization for videos funded by the Treasury?\n\nThere will not be ads/monetization.","signature":"18dac4e2c7c4803f1ee864172e36ad0549676ee3aa4c721a5fafd2973a24645c4fa3f48ffca897a0587eba4f0688a2cfcb2bc5043ecf72e5864c947169523109","publickey":"988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458","commentid":"16","receipt":"4db8508d89cd79980ecd72afd691c30ca8eeaef34aebfc8a4cc187342404da46f2c8c47a8e279d3570f1665e31ae38547ced61a4ba6ea41728aa86d0d9201f07","timestamp":1580670640,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

If it's on the DCR YT channel, it can be assumed the Treasury paid for it in some manner.  Regardless, I have no issues including that information on all content created moving forward.","signature":"a7de6860a16ece8b1b81bb428e2d1543ed1fac5dab277d411973660114ff4c2bd097388cd4b72c4d42cd3a4da555b5833831aea42999ddcf9840323b6044dd04","publickey":"988e824870740811a14e955ba8749e1f100f8cbc777af7dd3d6d9a9295646458","commentid":"17","receipt":"865d8b9ff738b2de6e80de3d27fcbf50d913cdd508c9751afcf6a63a379ee4fb5d43c3cf2d3f454a59f537e14ce23af4c714b01060b5879071f7d2d5e2959103","timestamp":1580671402,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
