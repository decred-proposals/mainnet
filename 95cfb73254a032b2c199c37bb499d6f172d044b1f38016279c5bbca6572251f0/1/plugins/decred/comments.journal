Video content travels and is a great medium to enhance the monthly reporting we get from the decred jornal and now weekly reporting we get from decred drive.\n\nAdditional areas/topics you may want to consider for content development: \n\n- expanded stakeholder profiles / stories\n\n- original content on how Decred is proliferating and being used around the world\n\n- a future of work series that highlight the decred contractor model and how its creating income on every populated continent etc\n\nGreat and much needed idea. Based on the quality of work you have already contributed this is a no-brainer for me.\n","signature":"cb2bbb423623d31b95d229d8d2ea459c58a9599f934fe5faa2784834070288d1c11b2b9701afacf552acaed572fc9831b545641357b5aa1613456e3c195d7c05","publickey":"6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","commentid":"1","receipt":"b3edeeca0d88dc37c8568d61c27f90e7ed9766ab8ed5f0beb3fef585a3774374047536cce871a64580104060f5756abbeca78bc7b27366422a1aaf9c08156605","timestamp":1580494922,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

This adds value and can increase adoption.   It's this kind of video content that the average user stumbles upon via YouTube Recommendations, and this can boost adoption, and it can also help existing DCR users get a quick rundown.\n\nProposal is well-written and I have no objection to any part of it! Good luck.","signature":"a06c2ffa29910628d391cb706b3be5e71bd0e2989379c7b25860c72a23f9bdc3942cca3817b53130dfccfac0ce7e243cf9ef9ca0c6b8ac869750a9470575d509","publickey":"f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","commentid":"2","receipt":"c9ebb5ace2ff254548ea742484854f4b61d795c3e5e95f3fef4b73e8f784bb70bbef2e22db7d07096da13cb92e729d39bba8d375b0390533cad5709cb2d4120c","timestamp":1580495903,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
