Video Content Production for Decred

## Summary

This proposal seeks funding for 6 months of Video Content Creation for the Decred Project.

## Why

Currently, most of Decred's News, Updates, Education and Research is text-based.  Disseminating content in a video format may be a preferred way for Stakeholders to keep up with the project, and a better way for newcomers to learn more about Decred. It will also help DCR's activity reach a wider audience by
existing on mainstream media platforms like YouTube.

## News and Events

### Regular Videos to be produced regarding News, Politeia Proposals, and Events:

- **Bi-weekly News Reports**: Think the [Decred Drive](https://medium.com/@decreddrive) and [Decred Journal](https://medium.com/decred/decred-journal-december-2019-9b48c8bf8516) but visualized for the DCR community (and newcomers) to see in video format on YouTube.

- Continually Generate **"Best Of" Snippets** for both old and new content captured from DCR's Media.

- Videos **breaking down major Politeia Proposals** as they occur.

- **Editing video content captured from Events** to best be displayed on DCR's YouTube channel.

- **Film Events** (when possible). I plan on relocating to Europe this year and becoming present at any events I can attend. I'm not quite sure what the Events for Europe look like this year, but I know contractors like Haon are quite active in Holland with events and I will be there.

## General Videos about Decred

I would like to produce general videos related to Decred as a sort of educational "101 Series". 

A sample of videos I would like to make:

- Beginners Guide to Decred in 2020
- Benefits of becoming a Decred Stakeholder
- Decred's Origin Explained (ex-BTC devs)
- Decred's Pre-Mine Explained
- Explain Secure, Adaptable, Sustainable (Decred's Core Tenets Meaning)
- How to become a Decred contractor + CMS + DAO in Laymen's terms
- How to Stake (In under 2 minutes) - (Direct & Simple Staking Tutorial)
- How Decred is more Secure due to PoS/PoW.
- Video breaking down Privacy Features
- Videos about the Lightning Network
- Videos covering the work of DCR's Researchers (Checkmate, PermaBull, RichardRed, ammarooni)
- Mobile Wallet Overviews

And any other suggestions the community may have for video content.
## Goals

My aim with these videos is to deliver content that is **direct, interesting, informative, and meaningful**. Videos will be highly edited to be **at most** 10 minutes in length in order to secure high retention rates among viewers.

I aim to deliver 4 to 6 Videos a month to be posted on the [Decred YouTube account.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2bYDaPYHpSmJPh_M5dNSg)


## How

This work generally includes:

- Gathering relevant Content/Data/Research
- Scripting 
- Filming
- Editing
- Feedback + Finalization
- Dissemination

I use Professional Grade Equipment for filming: Sony A7iii + Tamron 28-75mm.

Edited in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## Who

This work will be executed by me, [Exitus](https://twitter.com/coveryfire7777). I have been a Stakeholder and strong advocate for Decred since 2017.

I have been making Decred related videos over the last few months. [See my YouTube Channel here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyvkBCFN0AMf3jXf8I7doaQ?view_as=subscriber) 

For best reference of the production value to expect, [see my latest video talking about the recent PR Proposals.](https://youtu.be/uzhc2CKI2wk)

Note: I may inquire about certain things with Contractors working on the Decred Journal/Drive/Research as I plan to pull content from these sources.

I may ask Contractors working in Design to generate a video thumbnail template that follows a similar artistic pattern to the ones found on other videos on the DCR YouTube Channel in order to maintain conformity. 




## Cost: 

I estimate I will spend approximately 14 to 20 hours a week working on video content. 

At a rate of $30 USD/Hour this comes out to roughly **$1,680-$2,400 per month**.

 I propose a **hardcap of $2,400 as the maximum billable amount per month paid in DCR.**

The workload will vary month to month based on the number of Proposals, Events, Updates, and other on-goings within the project, and will be billed accordingly via the Contractor Management System.

I also seek to be compensated for any video related work done starting January 1, 2020.



## When

Starting immediately and lasting for 6 months, after which I will create a Proposal for Renewal.
