High-Profile Billboard Marketing Campaign

**What**

A 4-week billboard marketing campaign targeted at the elite upper-class, those with disposable income and a high risk tolerance for speculative assets. 50 billboards strategically placed throughout Hollywood and West LA to build brand recognition and meaningful growth. 

**Why**

As the global financial system continues in decline, an influx of new interest will enter the crypto space. It’s imperative we build top-of-mind awareness to the Decred project to stand out amongst the collective noise. Billboards are non-invasive, cost-effective, and provide a high level of consumer exposure. Top-of mind recallability is great, but the question is whether it will actually trigger changes in consumer purchase behavior. Multiple studies have shown that brand awareness is a prevalent choice tactic for consumers inexperienced in buying a new product. Being the first to get Decred implanted in consumer’s minds increases the barrier to entry that other coins/platforms will face later. So why LA? LA, in particular, has the worst traffic congestion levels of any U.S. city ([TomTom's 2019 Traffic Index](https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/ranking/?country=CA,MX,US)). This increasingly lengthy commute isn’t just a jam, it’s a captive audience.

**How**

A carefully planned campaign throughout [Hollywood](https://i.imgur.com/sf0kfNT.jpg) and [West LA](https://i.imgur.com/g7HzTRw.jpg). 50 billboards (at a size of 6’ x 12’ each) spanning intersections, thoroughfares, and other high traffic areas. The Decred name, logo, and distinct messaging widely presented to a wealthy and impressionable audience. 4 design iterations with variations in color combinations and taglines such as:
-	Secure. Adaptable. Sustainable.
-	Superior Store of Value
-	Your money, your power
-	Decentralized, Credible, Robust

**Who**

This proposal is submitted by Ori Tabak. I’ve been staking since early 2019. Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Media from the University of California, Irvine. Over the last few years I’ve worked at Netflix, Miramax, and other large media companies. I have strong understanding of publicity and presentation.
I currently work at an advertising agency in West LA (Woodshop Studios), where we build high-profile marketing campaigns for big-budget fast-food, automobile manufacturers, and the like. 

**When**

Due to uncertainty with Covid-19, billboards are inexpensive. There’s an imperative to capitalize on affordable marketing, but also we don’t want to launch before Quarantine is over. Therefore, I posit 6 months from now provides a reasonable window. Currently looking to launch in October to coincide with [LA Blockchain Week](https://lablockchainweek.org/) (provided availability). 
-	Hollywood (25 Billboards) – Package Rate per 4 weeks: $10,000
-	West LA (25 Billboards) – Package Rate per 4 weeks: $10,000
-	I will design and manage the creation of the Billboards – 80 hours at 40$/hr: $3,200
-	Production cost for printing and materials: $1,250

Once erected, I will take photos of all the billboards and submit to the community.
