Thanks for submitting the proposal so we can evaluate it properly and see what the stakeholders think. \n\nI actually quite like the idea of Decred showing up on billboards, especially if we could make the billboards stand out and give people a laugh or pause for thought. If the price of billboards really declines considerably because of lower traffic levels during lockdown, that could be an opportunity of sorts, where you would be hoping that the billboards get picked up on social media and shared that way. Imagine a deserted scene, usually bustling, with a billboard saying something like \n* Decred: global digital currency governed transparently by its users. * money printer does not go BRRRR\n\nSome questions about the proposal:\n\n1. How much would these billboards usually cost? You mention that billboards are currently inexpensive, it would be useful to know what the standard rates are and how they have been affected by presently reduced public mobility.\n\n2. Why choose a time 6 months from now? It is difficult to predict what the situation might be that far ahead into 2020. How long would it take to go from proposal approval to billboards being up?\n\n3. What would the 80 hours of work on designing and managing the creation of the billboards involve? To someone who is not in the billboards trade it seems like most of that would be producing images to use?\n\nI'm not convinced about the target area, or concentrating so much in one place. The audience in these locations might be wealthy but are they impressionable enough to invest in a cryptocurrency because they saw it on a billboard?\n\nIn my view the point of this kind of campaign should be to spark as many people as possible to think \"what's this Decred thing it looks interesting\". Preferably people who are more likely to appreciate what Decred has to offer, but I don't see any way to target that specifically in the context of billboards.\n\n\n ","signature":"85e912aa48d08871cad134e29c189d2ef3801add973dd37e79605bd9b1079194f05a579df28781b34deedb5e09b70bb3c8128c865413fcfb3a052158f78c4601","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"015da78409d7794648119a87264b26805cd79ab2e83a23d66181041c82fe478983a15d4b382a50770dec9aa647c5acdc7df6280b889c1b1d0f05ddb0c871130f","timestamp":1586457405,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A Superbowl ad? :)\n\nIn all seriousness, billboards are expensive. They also only have a short viewing time, so they can't be used to provide a complete selling pitch for a product, especially something as complex as Decred. They're great for two things: 1) putting out a catchy hook, with a URL/phone number for more information, which contains the actual pitch, or 2) simply impressing brand awareness in people's minds (which is what you're proposing), without consumer action at the moment. A great example of brand awareness in the US is Geico. I don't know much of anything about them, and have never dealt with them, but I'd have to be living in a cave by myself not to know that Geico sells auto insurance! They have completely impressed in people's minds the awareness that \"Geico = auto insurance.\" The problem with this approach for Decred is that the general population is not acquainted with cryptocurrencies. There is no way we can impress \"Decred is a cryptocurrency\" into people's minds if they don't know what a cryptocurrency is.\n\nFurthermore, brand awareness does nothing if there isn't something else to move people to action. The government takes care of that for Geico: you buy a car, you need auto insurance; the brand awareness kicks in, and Geico is the first company you think of. We don't have that here; even if we impress in everyone's mind \"Decred is a cryptocurrency\", we still need to somehow move people to action to purchase cryptocurrency, which is the harder part, IMO. \n\nIn summary, billboard advertising to the general public is too early at this stage. Brand awareness will not push people to purchase cryptocurrency, and the portion of the population already interested in purchasing cryptocurrency is too small for billboards targeting them to be economical.","signature":"042d622432a68539e41e078d037556696d7c759024ef809789dfcf44e4a3609152838da906ebfb0acd82dccdd4c09e66d1363484631ebebc3072b619e636210a","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"2","receipt":"7f2180cfd393e780fe5b798442c2e3baed4d65fbd145d52da1e9f2204ef98972d489bcc687ba3329376dcac3d1133a0a0d742551d366c10c0df70196c374d804","timestamp":1586459429,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
