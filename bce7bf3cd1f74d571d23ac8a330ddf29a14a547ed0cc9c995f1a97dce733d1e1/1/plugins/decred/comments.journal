Thanks for submitting the proposal so we can evaluate it properly and see what the stakeholders think. \n\nI actually quite like the idea of Decred showing up on billboards, especially if we could make the billboards stand out and give people a laugh or pause for thought. If the price of billboards really declines considerably because of lower traffic levels during lockdown, that could be an opportunity of sorts, where you would be hoping that the billboards get picked up on social media and shared that way. Imagine a deserted scene, usually bustling, with a billboard saying something like \n* Decred: global digital currency governed transparently by its users. * money printer does not go BRRRR\n\nSome questions about the proposal:\n\n1. How much would these billboards usually cost? You mention that billboards are currently inexpensive, it would be useful to know what the standard rates are and how they have been affected by presently reduced public mobility.\n\n2. Why choose a time 6 months from now? It is difficult to predict what the situation might be that far ahead into 2020. How long would it take to go from proposal approval to billboards being up?\n\n3. What would the 80 hours of work on designing and managing the creation of the billboards involve? To someone who is not in the billboards trade it seems like most of that would be producing images to use?\n\nI'm not convinced about the target area, or concentrating so much in one place. The audience in these locations might be wealthy but are they impressionable enough to invest in a cryptocurrency because they saw it on a billboard?\n\nIn my view the point of this kind of campaign should be to spark as many people as possible to think \"what's this Decred thing it looks interesting\". Preferably people who are more likely to appreciate what Decred has to offer, but I don't see any way to target that specifically in the context of billboards.\n\n\n ","signature":"85e912aa48d08871cad134e29c189d2ef3801add973dd37e79605bd9b1079194f05a579df28781b34deedb5e09b70bb3c8128c865413fcfb3a052158f78c4601","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"015da78409d7794648119a87264b26805cd79ab2e83a23d66181041c82fe478983a15d4b382a50770dec9aa647c5acdc7df6280b889c1b1d0f05ddb0c871130f","timestamp":1586457405,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
