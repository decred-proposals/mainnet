Thanks for submitting the proposal so we can evaluate it properly and see what the stakeholders think. \n\nI actually quite like the idea of Decred showing up on billboards, especially if we could make the billboards stand out and give people a laugh or pause for thought. If the price of billboards really declines considerably because of lower traffic levels during lockdown, that could be an opportunity of sorts, where you would be hoping that the billboards get picked up on social media and shared that way. Imagine a deserted scene, usually bustling, with a billboard saying something like \n* Decred: global digital currency governed transparently by its users. * money printer does not go BRRRR\n\nSome questions about the proposal:\n\n1. How much would these billboards usually cost? You mention that billboards are currently inexpensive, it would be useful to know what the standard rates are and how they have been affected by presently reduced public mobility.\n\n2. Why choose a time 6 months from now? It is difficult to predict what the situation might be that far ahead into 2020. How long would it take to go from proposal approval to billboards being up?\n\n3. What would the 80 hours of work on designing and managing the creation of the billboards involve? To someone who is not in the billboards trade it seems like most of that would be producing images to use?\n\nI'm not convinced about the target area, or concentrating so much in one place. The audience in these locations might be wealthy but are they impressionable enough to invest in a cryptocurrency because they saw it on a billboard?\n\nIn my view the point of this kind of campaign should be to spark as many people as possible to think \"what's this Decred thing it looks interesting\". Preferably people who are more likely to appreciate what Decred has to offer, but I don't see any way to target that specifically in the context of billboards.\n\n\n ","signature":"85e912aa48d08871cad134e29c189d2ef3801add973dd37e79605bd9b1079194f05a579df28781b34deedb5e09b70bb3c8128c865413fcfb3a052158f78c4601","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"015da78409d7794648119a87264b26805cd79ab2e83a23d66181041c82fe478983a15d4b382a50770dec9aa647c5acdc7df6280b889c1b1d0f05ddb0c871130f","timestamp":1586457405,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

A Superbowl ad? :)\n\nIn all seriousness, billboards are expensive. They also only have a short viewing time, so they can't be used to provide a complete selling pitch for a product, especially something as complex as Decred. They're great for two things: 1) putting out a catchy hook, with a URL/phone number for more information, which contains the actual pitch, or 2) simply impressing brand awareness in people's minds (which is what you're proposing), without consumer action at the moment. A great example of brand awareness in the US is Geico. I don't know much of anything about them, and have never dealt with them, but I'd have to be living in a cave by myself not to know that Geico sells auto insurance! They have completely impressed in people's minds the awareness that \"Geico = auto insurance.\" The problem with this approach for Decred is that the general population is not acquainted with cryptocurrencies. There is no way we can impress \"Decred is a cryptocurrency\" into people's minds if they don't know what a cryptocurrency is.\n\nFurthermore, brand awareness does nothing if there isn't something else to move people to action. The government takes care of that for Geico: you buy a car, you need auto insurance; the brand awareness kicks in, and Geico is the first company you think of. We don't have that here; even if we impress in everyone's mind \"Decred is a cryptocurrency\", we still need to somehow move people to action to purchase cryptocurrency, which is the harder part, IMO. \n\nIn summary, billboard advertising to the general public is too early at this stage. Brand awareness will not push people to purchase cryptocurrency, and the portion of the population already interested in purchasing cryptocurrency is too small for billboards targeting them to be economical.","signature":"042d622432a68539e41e078d037556696d7c759024ef809789dfcf44e4a3609152838da906ebfb0acd82dccdd4c09e66d1363484631ebebc3072b619e636210a","publickey":"1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","commentid":"2","receipt":"7f2180cfd393e780fe5b798442c2e3baed4d65fbd145d52da1e9f2204ef98972d489bcc687ba3329376dcac3d1133a0a0d742551d366c10c0df70196c374d804","timestamp":1586459429,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But why it’s done and how imo needs to be much more thoroughly thought over, as this would be the first instance to see DCR on billboards and is the key to the whole thing. Worth critically looking at pros/cons of other projects for starters, as this can be approached through a number of \"common strategies\".\n\n- Strategy-wise, a brand awareness billboard campaign with just a DCR symbol + tagline is inconsiderate. There is little reason for it to be picked up or remembered when most folks might not know what’s a cc or that DCR is a cc in the first place. This type of campaigns make sense for major brands, you know to only use a symbol or logo – but taking into any account DCR’s current position shows there’s a very long way to go. \n\n- The rough concepts provided look terrible and illustrate an opposite story. Rather than appealing towards an upper class/elites or whatnot, a DCR symbol with a tagline next to some random busy food joints and various other billboards feels like noise, gets lost in noise, or worst risks coming off as a scammy Saul Goodman-type billboard.\u2028\n\n- The design related details are not coherent: \u2028\n*“30 hours designing high quality PSDs” –––– “4 design iterations with variations in color combinations and taglines such as”* – I take the design approach is using a Decred logo with a tagline added to it? That won't take 4 full days of work for any competent designer. If you’re proposing for almost 4 full days of design work, imo this needs to actually bring  much more value to the table and prove it in the proposal. Also, unless mistaken by the public Linkedin profile, you’re listed as a “Technical coordinator” at the agency mentioned, so I take it you manage operations or production essentially, but maybe not even print matters? Details like *“high quality PSDs”* while all the content is likely in vector should get the red alarm bells ringing for anyone dealing with large scale printing …\n\nNot to bust the balls further, my point is that above mentioned tells you’ve stretched yourself horizontally. While all described can probably be delivered in some form, it seems far more sensible and likely to get some real results if you were to gather up a specialized team from that advertising agency rather, than attempting to cover it all alone. Ie. a creative director or a strategist to work out a comms + creative concept with more weight to it and present it properly; a designer with a solid experience and ability who can bring that concept to life and you in role of what you’re actually specialized in. \u2028\u2028\u2028\u2028\n\nConsideration for DCR stakeholders in matters of design quality and value – in many cases it makes a lot of sense to include various design or creative work as a part of the proposal. When this is proposed (or if it's missing and seems needed, consider requesting it), the proposal should involve designers or creatives with relevant specialization. The abilities, relevance of specialization and experience can be reviewed in portfolios or case studies as a proof. Alternatively, as now and as seen before, anyone with basic ps or ai skills can probably mess around with all the gh/dcrdesign assets and produce just something. This shouldn't cut it when the delivery requires bringing additional value to the table as well is charged at a comparable rate. Just devalues the whole discipline.","signature":"4adb28f484445dbec53618781e56da5095293c83e3b055e1358e7d7a054a8a4ae3c302f7503f52841992cd0a09b1a26c56529a5c97955a6c8d07889eff0b2a0c","publickey":"db0979d1b10a1180ceb3bc497132a98ea3d40ecbac1d2b8a1ab687039721146c","commentid":"9","receipt":"965373419c12e218510616d9a97b83b2ffcb59b70f98843f66ea9362c685feb36b0bb9d17478abd6c76bb5e3db3cd07b9b7fb9192257c752e7418f3b1ef08d07","timestamp":1586524692,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

So it seems there's an element of gambling on what the mobility situation will be like several months into the future in any scenario? I guess whoever using the billboards right now is getting pretty poor value for what they are paying, if that deal was agreed months ago. If the rate right now is down by just 33% this makes it seem like there is little opportunity to even get a reasonable deal, never mind finding a bargain.\n3.  How much of the 10 hours researching and contacting billboard companies for competing quotes have you already done? It seems like this would be more useful before the proposal was approved, to know how much it will cost with greater accuracy. Or is the intention to do this after the proposal is approved to lower its cost and bill less than the budgeted amount?

The people who sit in cars going to work aren't predominantly entrepreneurs, but quite the opposite: employees. The proposal didn't demonstrate something about the campaign that targets businesses. Like something about the message, or something about the location of the billboard.\n\nThe first citation is from 1990, 30 years ago.  A huge difference since is digital. Brand awareness may have been enough when it was hard to research products but this isn't the world we live in today.

(With that said, it comes with some thoughts)...\n\n1) Dcred as we know is one of the most intelligent communities in the crypto space. Sadly, intelligence does not necessarily translate to communication. The best coaches aren't always the best players.  No one i've seen has yet been able to \"dumb down\" Decred so the average intelligence person could understand w/out knowing anything about crypto. Dynamic charts, cute comics, on-chain analysis, are all technical and take a base of crypto knowledge ( at the very least) to be able to digest it. Then, still I think the majority of people don't know what a chart says, just that it sounds super intelligent therefore assumed important and not really understood by a commoner like myself.\n\n2) In 2018 Coinbase almost released a Superbowl commercial showcasing buying crypto. The market timing is probably why they pulled the add, but it was brilliant. You watch that and you go, I want to be a part of that, let me at least look into this and see what its all about. I think this proposal can do exactly that. Make people see an ad and say let me see what that's all about. Once people enter wonderland we know it leads to the rabbit hole we all have gone in with crypto and in particular Decred.\n\n3) With that said, I cant say the rough concept caught my attention. But, its exactly that a rough concept and I think it can be incredible with some more work. Just the sheer idea has me so excited.\n\nWe ( I ) just want people to see Decred. See first, ask questions. Does anyone remember the Plan B campaign in Miami? Incredible. People taking pictures, sharing, googling the symbol. It goes a long way. Maybe the hyper intelligent people believe that people should come organically. There is a sever disconnect between me and them. I am an evangelist for Decred and crypto. But, I spent years telling my friends and family about Bitcoin in 2014-16 and yes i'm prob not a good coach, but no interest, no one got it. I believe do something bold. Grab people attention. People will search, and some people will go down the hole and never return. People have to remember the majority of the world is of average intelligence or lower. We average folk need this. We need to be shaken, hand held. Then we can fly.\n\nI love this proposal, I'm looking forward to seeing more artwork. I really want to vote for this. The idea has my vote. It will just take the final proposed campaign to cast it. Rooting for you. I really want this.\n","signature":"de79aab66afc904b2c78a456f65cc6b2918d6b91d3a56180e5edabe8efae6029531556527dffd675590847f07812eaf5dffd80bdd8f65e7661272b432e10fe04","publickey":"b1e980e9d97ab6ae6b085b359af20730d9f8d9c4d4fcb86c388d0df4cfa8e18e","commentid":"18","receipt":"7918cc911a2618849c9c4b73ff21bb5bd3c749de64f3e65670956eaaf823bfe260978e5074f2bfb81336009febd0687d04ab355e50a7049daaad9a3890925e0b","timestamp":1586920441,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

But, obvi thats too expensive. For now... I think however this is exactly the frame of mind to be in. Its so very different. Takes me to my point about \"Plan B\" thats pasted on the side of the monorail in Miami. Brillian! I want that for Decred. \n\nI will say that action to purchase crypto is not what we need/want per se. We want people to say \" what is Decred\" just like they do for bitcoin. In the UK one of the EPL soccer teams has the Bitcoin logon on their kit and all around the stadium. Its such a buzz. We want a buzz. We want people to google it. From there their path is forged. Isnt that the point of a billboard ad? To search. No one knew what GoDaddy did till they plastered it everywhere. Even their first super bowl commercials they didnt say what it did. It wasnt till the 4th that it was a domain service. Still resulted in millions of people searching for that name they just saw that doesnt know what it means. \n\nDoesnt need to impress that its anything other than a name and people search for it and then it all begins.\n\nMaybe it is too early stage. But, I think it is defiantly something that would be great and its something Decred hasnt done. Look at the response of product placement in logo of Decred in that netflix series. People who know me know im in love with Decred project. I post the logo. I made a cartoon meme. And ppl that saw it msgd me and said \"thats the logo you always post! What is it? Im gonna check it out\" Just a logo! Now add a name to search. Bingo. It opens doors to people like me that have short attention spans and cant decipher a checkmate  permabull on chain chart and jargin. I wanna be like the rest of everyone, but the reality is im not as intelligent so I just hope for a dumbed down explanation in the comments. \n\nIt is worth the cost (if done right and timed right) The cost is a drop in the bucket. People are way too frugal here and cant relate to the average person because almost everyone is above average.","signature":"5e8afbbda8e348eaad46e4fd81cb46801a83e6c692121efc7b99a585b7cd37cf2c88138cdb1a961c41feca0a64cd914c509babb142b66300bf37ece665014207","publickey":"b1e980e9d97ab6ae6b085b359af20730d9f8d9c4d4fcb86c388d0df4cfa8e18e","commentid":"19","receipt":"f83218a2e2b270e54502a29b4e418793c88275585e201f8a88b38a6e8421c0adc35bd9ad39bf1ae23126cd2ed3d85c4259476328f8a472dd8baed204abf9a70f","timestamp":1586921528,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
