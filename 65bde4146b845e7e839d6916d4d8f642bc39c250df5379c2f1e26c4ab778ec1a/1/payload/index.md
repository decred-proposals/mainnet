Decred - An economic phenomenon [Research and Education proposal]

Hi,

I’m [ammarooni](https://twitter.com/ammarooni). I’ve been studying Decred for more than a year, and have more recently become an active contributor in the community. I’m a student of economics and consumer behavior, and in my day job I create digital products in the financial industry.

Decred has an untold story in economics and social sciences. I’d like to create assets which can help spread the word.

This proposal is to create research and education papers which study Decred as a breakthrough in human progress and economics. I recently published my first analysis on Decred:

The next research papers will be similar in thought quality, but will explore different social and economic dimensions of Decred. I will distill complex thoughts into memeable insights which can be used in productive discussions to attract and retain long term community members. I’ve been accumulating research notes for several months which tie in Decred’s design with academia and traditional finance. Articulating the unrealized potential of Decred through high quality education assets will attract a deeper relationship with investors than short term marketing spend.


**Why – The Problem Statement**

Cryptocurrencies are a phenomena in economic and social co-ordination. While the mass public is in the early stages of understating blockchain as a financial technology, investors more easily understand the story of money and economics. Cryptoassets are unique products because people don’t buy them for their utility today, but their potential value in the future. As such, winning over hearts and wallets today requires a clear articulation of a cryptoassets long term potential.

I believe that Bitcoin is solving for the hidden problems in fiat currencies today, and Decred is solving for several dimensions left unexplored by Bitcoin. This advanced design can sometimes be difficult to distill as an economic story due to its complexity.

Bitcoin has captured the largest mind share in cryptocurrencies not only due to its technical proficiency, but also the strength of the philosophical beliefs held by its long term supporters. The most impactful studies on Bitcoin (eg The Bullish Case for Bitcoin & The Bitcoin Standard) speak about Bitcoin as a human and economic story.

Decred can benefit by conveying its own unique story as a breakthrough in human progress. Here’s a proposal to help:


**Proposal:**

This proposal is to conduct 3 months of economic deep dive to explore the social and economic potential of Decred as a story in human governance and monetary economics. The goal is to create impactful assets which can springboard a network of well educated ambassadors at large.

Topics of research and publication:
* $DCR as a breakthrough in property rights. Economic and financial research to show how $DCR combines features of stores of value, medium of exchange, and productive assets. Will explain how Decred’s current design (staking/governance) and proposed improvements (DEX) are achievements of monetary economics.
* Bitcoin unbundles money and state. Decred rebundles money and government, and gives people a digitally native voice. A study of Politea as an innovation in human governance and voting systems
* From distraction problems today to spending problems tomorrow: How Deflationary properties of Decred and Bitcoin will help humans with the spending temptations of Web 3.0
* Decred as a viable option for global reserves and sovereign wealth funds
* How macroeconomic forces of change are converging towards cryptocurrency adoption, and Decred presents an asymmetrical investment risk reward. 
* There are several sub themes underpinning these writings. As I come across more interesting concepts during my deep dives, I will happily add to this list.

The material will use language that is understandable by both retail and institutional investors. Where relevant, I will link out to existing Decred research to maximize the impact of community assets.

The writings will be published on Medium, and shared on social media by coordinating with the Decred community.


**Timeline:**

* A series of publications (3 to 5 writings, supported with social media presence) over the next 3 months (Nov, Dec, Jan).

**Cost:**

* $2k in arrears for first publication and foundational research, $6k for 3 months of future research and publications.
* Invoices will be billed monthly through the contractor management system
* Total: $8,000

**Rationale:**

* I’ve lived Decred’s values of “skin in the game” by investing a good 4 to 5 months towards research and community participation, and demonstrated “proof of work” (hehe) with my first publication. I will be doing further explorations to draw concepts from multidisciplinary academic areas.
* I believe in quality over quantity, so I will spend a considerable amount of effort in distilling key nuggets of shareable insights, rather than extended writings which don’t captivate readers.
* I am approaching this through a monthly invoice / pulse check rather than an hourly or lump sum payment, as academic deep dives can be more equated to share of mind rather than share of time. A $2k/month arrangement is a better representative of such a relationship. 
* An investment in persuasive and educative assets will more than pay for itself as it will enable new investors to enter Decred with higher conviction.
* The materials may also be helpful to current Decred holders, because deepening the community’s philosophical beliefs will make people less likely to panic sell during market downturns.
* The materials will empower Decred’s current community ambassadors in outreach discussions, as there are several social dimensions that have yet to be written about.
* This macro research will be a complement to the technical on-chain research currently being conducted by existing community contractors. The combination of technical and macroeconomic narratives will compound Decred’s value proposition.

**Risks and Mitigants:**

* I am not a developer, but I need to ensure technical correctness. This will be achieved by validating the papers with known community members before publication. This will also help in editing the content for maximum impact.
* Unlike a software deliverable which can be measured by specs, this proposal entails qualitative research. As I explore these topics, their themes may expand or amend if it helps their macro storytelling. I believe this adaptability will turn out to be a net positive for the end products.

This is my first proposal, and I’m happy for feedback and thoughts.

With thanks,
Ammar
