As I explore these topics, their themes may expand or amend if it helps their macro storytelling. I believe this adaptability will turn out to be a net positive for the end products.\n\nI agree that it's better to be adaptable and follow the interesting threads that emerge. I also value the freedom to diverge from a specified topic or question list if what I learn along the way takes me in a different direction.\n\n\u003e I am approaching this through a monthly invoice / pulse check rather than an hourly or lump sum payment, as academic deep dives can be more equated to share of mind rather than share of time. A $2k/month arrangement is a better representative of such a relationship.\n\nThis is a good point about \"share of mind\". It is hard to put an accurate number of hours on the time it takes to produce something like a research article, because the time spent writing is only one component and it's hard to draw the line around what counts as relevant reading/analysis time.\n\nI find it interesting that the last 3 proposals with a research component have all specified what is effectively a monthly rate with a (fairly loose) definition of the deliverables. I can see the appeal, as it eliminates the need to track hours. This is structured in a similar way to the kind of stipend that some academic institutions and funding bodies give out to research students. If it works out well for everyone else I might think about switching to this model in my next proposal.","signature":"1f3e76c8f97a4a847b6bd5db94158ca6e69817cf4c2d6d3d547a9e3c0fde449a98bf19beb26e5ae1f64f632470e6f6d3c32be177d322700d2aee3c95142fa806","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"1a81ecd5c6770bde7f577bca92839eb9b5100087d7e1eadb34f219d964511e08109f4056c5899c4ddf35b2eb500f7ec197fe76d4f6cf69abe31fbbb0ad2d5d0b","timestamp":1571353694,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
