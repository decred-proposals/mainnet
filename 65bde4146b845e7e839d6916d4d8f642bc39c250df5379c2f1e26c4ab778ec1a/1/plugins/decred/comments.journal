As I explore these topics, their themes may expand or amend if it helps their macro storytelling. I believe this adaptability will turn out to be a net positive for the end products.\n\nI agree that it's better to be adaptable and follow the interesting threads that emerge. I also value the freedom to diverge from a specified topic or question list if what I learn along the way takes me in a different direction.\n\n\u003e I am approaching this through a monthly invoice / pulse check rather than an hourly or lump sum payment, as academic deep dives can be more equated to share of mind rather than share of time. A $2k/month arrangement is a better representative of such a relationship.\n\nThis is a good point about \"share of mind\". It is hard to put an accurate number of hours on the time it takes to produce something like a research article, because the time spent writing is only one component and it's hard to draw the line around what counts as relevant reading/analysis time.\n\nI find it interesting that the last 3 proposals with a research component have all specified what is effectively a monthly rate with a (fairly loose) definition of the deliverables. I can see the appeal, as it eliminates the need to track hours. This is structured in a similar way to the kind of stipend that some academic institutions and funding bodies give out to research students. If it works out well for everyone else I might think about switching to this model in my next proposal.","signature":"1f3e76c8f97a4a847b6bd5db94158ca6e69817cf4c2d6d3d547a9e3c0fde449a98bf19beb26e5ae1f64f632470e6f6d3c32be177d322700d2aee3c95142fa806","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"3","receipt":"1a81ecd5c6770bde7f577bca92839eb9b5100087d7e1eadb34f219d964511e08109f4056c5899c4ddf35b2eb500f7ec197fe76d4f6cf69abe31fbbb0ad2d5d0b","timestamp":1571353694,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

We have a growing amount of excellent content being produced, but I'm not seeing a response in view counts, likes, etc. I'm not saying we shall stop producing excellent content, but rather ramp up efforts and constantly think about reaching our audiences.\n\nSo my main question is what is your plan to get the eyeballs (that your work definitely deserves)? Where will you find them?\n\n\u003e Cryptocurrencies are a phenomena in economic and social **co-ordination**. While the mass public is in the early stages of understating blockchain as a financial technology\n\nYou hit my nerve here. I think human coordination is extremely undervalued by humans. Sometimes I feel the mass public is in the early stages of understanding _coordination_. The Internet opened the opportunity for unprecedented level of coordination and solving problems that were impossible to solve before. I believe sound decentralized money is the second big step. Data protocols allow to coordinate information, but that's not enough. Cryptocurrencies allow to coordinate _value_ (I call it _energy_) and power amazing projects that could not get funded earlier.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not seeing mass excitement and people talking about crypto everywhere, in _that way_. I mean the sound decentralized money, not those abstract \"blockchains\". (Concepts you operate has a huge perceptual impact on how distant it is from your real life.) People don't seem to understand that it is a protocol to coordinate energy that can be used to stop leaking our collective value and to direct it to solving our problems. It appears to me that people are discouraged from large scale coordination by lack of tools, centralized gatekeeping infrastructure, historic suppression of private money, unverifiable and weak voting power that makes politics uninteresting, and other factors. I mean change.org is wonderful but it's not binding and not powerful enough. Divide and conquer still works. People need to understand that we live in a great time when this can change.\n\nI hope not all economic theories suck (\"inflation is good for you!\" or \"we will debase your wealth for your benefit\") and connecting with decent ones is a great idea.\n\nBack to the proposal,\n\n\u003e The material will use language that is understandable by both retail and institutional investors.\n\nDo \"retail investors\" include \"normal people\" or is some finance background still required?\n\nIdea: negotiate with our translators to spread the message beyond English speakers. I'm sure many of those countries are in much bigger need for sound money that actually serves people.\n\n\u003e The writings will be published on Medium\n\nIf you put it in Git/GitHub repo [like this](https://github.com/xaur/writings) it allows to grab all of your writings at once and easily mirror it elsewhere if it gets censored. It also gives collaborative text review and editing tools that might help you to pass it by devs (they're all on GitHub already). And perhaps Markdown is an easier format to translate from. Note that this only concerns text sources, while main published version can be Medium (like we did for Decred Journal and Politeia Digest).\n\n\u003e The materials will empower Decred’s current community ambassadors in outreach discussions\n\nRelated idea: establish a [standard of quality](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/48) for ambassadors.\n\nYour past Twitter and Medium work is of high quality. Consider linking some of your tweet threads or interviews because they help to know you better.\n\nGood luck!","signature":"76245bd58444885035a9bd949409a0bb6849521ba309d4534d56c25f330a0c707e7e8dfa879414a08739dced20aea2c7e20f282ffa244a6ea47db26f115cd004","publickey":"a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","commentid":"6","receipt":"56b6918d74e9c0218c1062b8f1c9bf3361351bbb96de2b0741a5840cd21211292c466a56e3b4d5c73b5269b473c1df8ab62ecf1defc0f791995bcaef15ae5c0a","timestamp":1571402198,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
