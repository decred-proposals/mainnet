Some aspects of what you propose are already being well covered (e.g. monthly newsletter, tutorials). As the proposal doesn't mention the existing efforts I would guess you are not familiar with them.\n\nOther aspects of the proposal just seem like a bad idea. I had a look at the Decentraland Crypto of the Month giveaway on your site at the moment. This is not something I would like to see Decred engage in, particularly the part where people earn prize draw tickets by liking/retweeting whatever you tell them to. I guess $100/month for the giveaway is just to cover admin and the prizes would be extra?\n\n$1,000/month for \"Several weekly mentions on Youtube videos\" also doesn't sound like good value, and I wonder how that money would be spent.\n\n\u003e We would accept DCR, BTC and ETH.\n\nDecred's Treasury only has one of these to spend.","signature":"807d9035f096c95cf9cbd20c643314ee465473ec8db6003672a3dcc38719b7e193d8541f342ca58783394efc7279c34a72ef2cfa14828fcce105d50f1310b307","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"8a065e231c4959cf3ec0b079cac409c7a1576b230ad9000f398333d6978d10b60555599c06834f38a86295c87cf1765a9e82b1d106c912cfc421af8f8f9b360e","timestamp":1560302427,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}

Allow me then to respond to your suggestions in the best possible way to clarify the points that we have not explained well enough and rectify those where necessary.\n\nI would like to make clear that this is not an all or nothing, this is a proposal to the community, to make use of our environment beyond the publication of news from the sector. If part of the proposal or its totality does not conform to the needs of Decred we have no problem in retiring or rethinking it.\n\nWe are aware that Decred is already being covered by other media, as the second phase of the Ditto Communications proposal was recently approved, we simply have not seen the need to extend our proposal with information that the community already knows and that does not concern the work we are proposing to carry out.\n\nWhat we are proposing is an addition to increase media coverage. Given that in the world there are almost 8 billion people, of which less than 100 million use blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, we believe that all broadcasting work is good to promote the change, and of the thousands of existing projects, we believe that Decred It is one of the few that should be made known to the greatest number of people today.\n\nWe are sorry that the approach of the Crypto of the Month contest seems like a bad idea, but let me explain it a little more in detail so that the idea is better understood. The Crypto of the Month emerged as an idea at the beginning of this year as a disinterested initiative that would allow us to promote the few projects that in our humble opinion seem serious to us and with a value for society, beyond producing a promising product with which to enrich oneself quickly. The Crypto of the Month itself is not a contest but a series of actions that we carry out during that month to make the project known to our readers. The contest itself is a way to encourage readers to share the contest (as they get more tickets) and help more people receive the message.\n\nSadly we are aware that today the proportion of people interested in cryptocurrencies for noble reasons is very low, compared to those who have seen in this new market the opportunity to make easy money, but we are also aware that the latter can serve as messengers so that the message of Decred reaches those few who are interested in the change of economic paradigm that we are sure this technology is making possible. As you can see, until now the projects that have been Crypto of the Month are Grin (MW), Waves, Komodo and Decentraland. As for the actions to be carried out in the contest, these are aimed at spreading the word about them and making known both the promoted project and our media itself, given that until now all the contests of the Crypto of the Month have been disinterested and funded by ourselves.\n\nFor this contest, given that unlike the previous ones, Crypto Economy is not assuming the cost of it, we had thought that the actions to be carried out by the participants to obtain those tickets were such as:\n\nVisit blog Decred\nFollow twitter decred\nShare the contest (twitter, whatsapp ..)\n\nLet me clarify that we do not need $100 a month to carry out the contest, the total cost of the contest is $1,200 and it will be done during a single month. The cost is that because the prize we would like to give away is $1,000. The other $200 is the administration costs, social network advertising, and the fee that Gleam.io charges us. I have put a cost of $100 per month simply by dividing it by 12 months given that in the table of costs that we have added to the proposal we break down the monthly and annual costs.\n\nRegarding the proposal of videos on youtube. After talking with the youtubers with whom we have dealings, we have come to the conclusion that the exclusive videos about a specific project do not have as much impact as the inclusion of brief spaces that talk about the project in videos of general interest, such as in a weekly news video about cryptocurrencies, the youtuber can talk for a short time about Decred, ensuring that its viewers receive the message. These youtubers are going to dedicate a time and resources to the elaboration of their videos and that is the reason why they charge us for their services. Since this is not a service that we are going to lend directly, but we will use our contacts to act as intermediaries of this with non-profit, we will be transparent in its management. However, like everything in this proposal, it is likely to be modified or removed if the community considers it appropriate.\n\nOn the last point, the one that talks about the accepted currencies, you are right, it is our custom to give facilities but in this case it is unnecessary, I am going to modify the proposal to correct this part.\n\nI hope more members of the community will comment on their opinions as well so that we can adjust the proposal to the needs of the project and the community of Decred.\n\nAgain, thanks for your comments.","signature":"d1ebeecb239969e4623e1090137a5280b520ef115c2831f21966a26b8d6a4a6485a9a62a09b107d27223a229335c3ce53035efcd60030d1fae4432207f991602","publickey":"6bf827030057fcc9fc6c8d4719dad36cd985014f9ebbf06aca10c0b152b5b406","commentid":"3","receipt":"c8fc6bc0f5f453c20438d18bfc0f1fd5ab418e64bf7f93a124620addfa6e4a5ee12d2bb68a7660b97066fbd5c3c4b8d81019524d855696466678399b0972be03","timestamp":1560349728,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
