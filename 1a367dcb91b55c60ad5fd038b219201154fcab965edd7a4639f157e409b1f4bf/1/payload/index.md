DECREED MEDIA CAMPAIGN PROPOSAL - Crypto Economy - 2019/2020



# **WHAT**

Our media aims to bring blockchain technology to the general public showing the benefits of this technology not in relation to the earnings but as a way to achieve an individual financial sovereignty contributing a significant improvement in the lives of people.

Decred project and its true democratic philosophy matches completely our vision. Our proposal is to **run an intense informative campaign to bring Decred closer to a larger public** so that they know of the advantages and benefits that this self-government coin can offer and thus **increase the adoption of this technology.**

# **WHY**

Due to the recent increase in cryptographic markets, the subsequent raise in awareness by the general public, and given the growth forecasted for the coming years, we believe that this is the best moment to carry out broadcasting campaigns and to spread the word about all the advantages of decentralization, promoting a project with a wide reputation and remarkable progress as Decred.

# **HOW**

For this we have prepared an annual plan which includes:
 
-  Publication of every press release and updates on Decred project
-  Publication of a weekly analysis of the market performance of the Decred coin
-  Publication of teaching articles on the technology behind Decred
-  Publication of guides and tutorials to learn how to use, mining, wallets, etc…
-  Interviews with members of the Decred team that are willing to do it
-  Permanent decred banner on the Crypto Economy website
-  Decred will be selected as the Crypto of the Month which is a monthly program that we run in our main media (Crypto Economy) to help projects in which we believe to be known by the masses
-  We will run a giveaway in which the topic will be Decred and the price will be delivered in Decred
-  Weekly mentions in youtuve videos of influential crypto-related channels on English and Spanish languages
-  Decred promotion on our social media networks
-  Monthly newsletter to our subscribers about the last updates on Decred

# **WHO**

Crypto Economy is an independent multilingual platform dedicated to blockchain technology and the cryptocurrencies world, in which we publish, share and analyze the latest news about existing and future projects in the sector.

Our enthusiasm and fascination for Bitcoin and all what is blockchain related haven´t decreased during our 6 years experience. We fully believe in the benefits that the adoption and spread of Blockchain technology can provide, and we are passionate and commited with the task of raising awareness of it.
Our media site is a relatively young project that has shown a continous growth since 2016, encouraging us and making us feel positive and confident about our diffusion potential. We receive thousands of direct visits per day from very different locations and we also count with numerous followers in our social networks.

_CRYPTO ECONOMY AND DECRED_

The main members of the Crypto Economy team have closely followed the development of the project since its birth, being part of the first enthusiasts that mined Decred. So much so that in the launch of our media, Decred was one of the coins that were initially added to our mining profitability calculator, along with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Z-Chash.

We have also published some articles to make the Decred project known by our audience:

# **WHEN**

If approved, we plan to star the campaign as soon as possible after the approval of the proposal and it will last until the same day of 2020.  We would need 2 weeks to prepare the firsts materials for its publication (articles, video, etc).
