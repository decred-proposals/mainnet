Some aspects of what you propose are already being well covered (e.g. monthly newsletter, tutorials). As the proposal doesn't mention the existing efforts I would guess you are not familiar with them.\n\nOther aspects of the proposal just seem like a bad idea. I had a look at the Decentraland Crypto of the Month giveaway on your site at the moment. This is not something I would like to see Decred engage in, particularly the part where people earn prize draw tickets by liking/retweeting whatever you tell them to. I guess $100/month for the giveaway is just to cover admin and the prizes would be extra?\n\n$1,000/month for \"Several weekly mentions on Youtube videos\" also doesn't sound like good value, and I wonder how that money would be spent.\n\n\u003e We would accept DCR, BTC and ETH.\n\nDecred's Treasury only has one of these to spend.","signature":"807d9035f096c95cf9cbd20c643314ee465473ec8db6003672a3dcc38719b7e193d8541f342ca58783394efc7279c34a72ef2cfa14828fcce105d50f1310b307","publickey":"cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","commentid":"1","receipt":"8a065e231c4959cf3ec0b079cac409c7a1576b230ad9000f398333d6978d10b60555599c06834f38a86295c87cf1765a9e82b1d106c912cfc421af8f8f9b360e","timestamp":1560302427,"totalvotes":0,"resultvotes":0,"censored":false}
